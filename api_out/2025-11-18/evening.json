18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Venezuela’s opposition leader  María Corina Machado  has published a “freedom manifesto” outlining her vision of a “new era” for the country without its strongman Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The four-page document, dated November 9 but made public on Tuesday, lays out the democratic pillars she says all Venezuelans are entitled to, including the rights to vote, assemble and exercise free speech.\n \n\n   \n  Borrowing language from other democratic frameworks, such as the US Declaration of Independence, the text calls for decentralizing power from the government and restoring it to the public. “Every Venezuelan is born with inalienable rights that have been conferred upon them by our Creator, not by men,” part of the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who read the entire manifesto in a 15-minute video from an undisclosed location, declared that Maduro’s tight grip on power was coming to an end. Machado was driven into hiding after a disputed election last year, in which government-controlled electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner.\n \n\n   \n  “A new Venezuela is emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan government for comment.\n \n\n   \n  David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, said that Machado likely published the manifesto to bring attention back to Venezuelans’ democratic struggle and assure supporters she has a plan for the country if Maduro eventually steps down.\n \n\n   \n  He said the manifesto resembles a “proto-constitution” but noted that Machado didn’t mention whether she would suspend the current constitution, impose a new one, or call a constitutional assembly. “So the natural question is: What is the status of this?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Machado’s declaration comes as Maduro is confronting a US military build-up off Venezuela’s Caribbean shores. The US has amassed more than a dozen warships and some 15,000 troops in the region as part of what the Pentagon says is a mission to disrupt drug trafficking from Latin America.  It’s considered the  largest US military presence  in the region since the invasion of Panama in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  US officials say President Donald Trump is still  weighing  whether to carry out an attack inside Venezuela, though he has hinted that a diplomatic window may be opening.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro also suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart. “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” he said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela’s government has condemned the military build-up, calling it an attempt to oust Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  Machado, who has welcomed the US pressure, said in her manifesto that Maduro must be held accountable for his actions, claiming he has committed crimes against humanity including torture, killings and forced disappearances. Venezuela in the past has denied such claims.\n \n\n   \n  Smilde, whose research covers Chavismo, the leftist ideology associated with Maduro’s party, noted that in Machado’s call for justice, she didn’t discuss reconciliation among Venezuelans.\n \n\n   \n  “She doesn’t try to reach out to Chavismo at all here and say, ‘We need this process of reconciliation. We’re all Venezuelans.’ Nothing like that. So it tells me this is a document that is basically oriented toward the international community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Machado was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize  for keeping “the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-files-vote-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:48:00-05:00","title":"Congress greenlights bill forcing Trump’s DOJ to release Epstein files after monthslong GOP effort to quash it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following months of political infighting and attempts by Trump and GOP leaders to suppress it, Congress has passed a bipartisan bill requiring the Department of Justice to release all investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

greenlights bill forcing Trump’s DOJ to release Epstein files after monthslong GOP effort to quash it \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:48 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday took the significant step of ordering  President Donald Trump ’s Justice Department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of nasty infighting within the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  Congress is sending the measure — which remarkably won support from all but one Republican across both the House and Senate — to Trump’s desk once it’s formally transmitted between the chambers. Despite months of calling the issue a “Democratic hoax,” the president has said he’ll sign the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will do so “whenever it gets to the White House,” a senior White House official said Tuesday evening. (The president was already scheduled to host the Saudi crown prince for dinner at the White House Tuesday night.)\n \n\n   \n  The speed with which the bill moved through both chambers of Congress on Tuesday marked a stark reversal from recent months when Trump and GOP leaders worked furiously to quash it. But Trump ultimately decided to allow his party to back the measure as pressure mounted within his party.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, even Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team backed the measure, despite spending the summer and fall trying to quash Washington’s obsession with the Epstein files, while insisting the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy. And in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune did not stand in the way of Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s request for “unanimous consent” to pass it, sending it directly to Trump once received from the House.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said earlier Tuesday he was urging his Senate counterpart to add key protections for victims’ privacy, which would have slowed the bill, but Thune said he was unlikely to amend the legislation that came out of the House nearly unanimously. “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the President has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it … is in the cards,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Johnson said, “all the Republicans want to go on record to show they’re for maximum transparency.”\n \n\n   \n  It was a remarkable turnaround for Trump and Republican leaders in Washington, who had unsuccessfully tried to halt the measure led by a party agitator, Rep. Thomas Massie, and strongly backed by Democrats. But by this weekend, with a House vote looming, Trump and his team  feared an embarrassing defeat  was coming and he agreed to relent — effectively allowing GOP lawmakers to vote for Massie’s measure.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an overdue moment,” Massie said Tuesday, hours ahead of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,” the Kentucky Republican said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, quickly adding that they are now “on our side today.”\n \n\n   \n  Massie has been pilloried by Trump and his advisers in recent weeks, including personal attacks on his marriage and a campaign to primary him in his district.\n \n\n   \n  Yet on Tuesday, Massie said he welcomed Trump’s turnaround on the issue: “What he’s doing this week is strengthening his position by coming on board, and we’re glad to have him.”\n \n\n   \n  While Johnson delivered a blistering critique of Democrats over the Epstein saga ahead of the vote, the effort drew widespread support from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s get accountability, let’s get answers and let’s get this over with,” GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, added of the vote: “We all support holding bad guys accountable, and we’re all going to vote for this resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  The only lawmaker to vote against it, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, said he did so because of the way the legislation is written. “It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he wrote on X after casting his vote.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Johnson and GOP leaders are hopeful that they can soon turn the page from the months-long Epstein saga within their own conference, which has led to bitter feuds — like the one between Trump and his once-close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene in recent months has joined Massie in pushing for the release of the files, prompting Trump himself to call her a “traitor” and call for her to be ousted in a primary race.\n \n\n   \n  The House’s investigative committees have launched their own inquiries into the Epstein matter.\n \n\n   \n  It was Trump himself who had initially helped gin up the GOP’s interest in the government’s Epstein investigation. The president had repeatedly speculated publicly whether the late financier and sex offender had died in prison and promised on the campaign trail to declassify the files.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hand-picked DOJ officials had, too, fueled the speculation. When asked by a conservative podcast host in 2023 why the so-called Epstein list had not been released, Kash Patel suggested it was being kept hidden “because of who’s on that list.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February of this year that the Epstein client list was sitting on her desk.\n \n\n   \n  But months into Trump’s second term, the White House had released no new information about that investigation. The Epstein issue was quickly creating a major rift between Trump and his MAGA base. Many of his supporters were loudly complaining that the administration was failing to release what Trump once promised he would: the complete set of government files on Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, Massie, along with his Democratic partner, Rep. Ro Khanna, launched a rogue push to go around the speaker and bring a bill to the floor without GOP leaders’ approval. A handful of other Republicans — all women, including Greene — signed on, too.\n \n\n   \n  The White House resisted the effort, with personal phone calls to members who had backed the measure and public threats to Massie, Greene and others.\n \n\n   \n  But they couldn’t block it entirely. Just days earlier, Massie and Khanna secured the 218th signature on a procedural gambit, known as a discharge petition, that forced Johnson to bring the bill to the floor.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who provided that final signature to advance the measure, insisted on Tuesday it was not just a Democrat or Republican push.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a demand from the nation. This is not a partisan issue,” Grijalva said.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/basketball-nba-lebron-james-longest-career","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"11:15:00.000-05:00","title":"LeBron James begins season No. 23, marking longest career in NBA history","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"LeBron James began his 23rd NBA season on November 18, 2025, marking the longest career in league history, surpassing Vince Carter’s previous 22-season record.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Having problems with your favorite websites lately? It’s not just you.\n \n\n   \n  Web infrastructure provider Cloudflare experienced a disruption on Tuesday that temporarily impacted a swath of online services – from Spotify to ChatGPT and even President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform – marking the latest in a string of high-profile internet outages.\n \n\n   \n  An  Amazon Web Services issue  disrupted the daily routines of millions of people last month, in some cases preventing them from doing even simple tasks like ordering coffee or managing smart home appliances. Just days later,  Microsoft’s Azure service  was hit with an outage.\n \n\n   \n  According to experts, it’s a sign of the times – a combination of society’s  increased reliance on digital services , the consolidation of critical cloud infrastructure between just a few companies and the proclivity of people to complain about tech mishaps online.\n \n\n   \n  It also shows that no one, not even major tech companies, are immune to tech malfunctions.\n \n\n   \n  “It really almost doesn’t matter how well-situated the provider is in these cases, or even how sophisticated the IT organization and infrastructure is for a private business,” said Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing for IT and cybersecurity firm Netscout. Tech disruptions like these are “very, very common problems.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened at Cloudflare\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare’s outage was the result of a technical issue, not a cyberattack or malicious behavior, the company said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The company said the outage was caused by a “configuration file” that was meant to manage “threat traffic.”\n \n\n   \n  “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” the statement said.   \n \n\n   \n  Dane Knecht, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, shared additional details  in a post on X  on Tuesday afternoon. In short: a routine configuration change caused a bug to crash, which “cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”\n \n\n   \n  “Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Amazon outage similarly  involved a bug , which kicked off when two automated systems tried to update the same data simultaneously.\n \n\n   \n  IT outages are relatively common, tech experts say.   Twenty years ago, it was typical   for IT services to down “all the time,” said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame and former computer scientist for the National Security Agency.\n \n\n   \n  “It would not be unusual to go a week at work having at least one outage of some IT service,” he said, noting that now everyone relies on the same large providers.\n \n\n   \n  The impacts can be widely felt when they happen at the major providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, that serve as the backbone of the web.   \n \n\n   \n  Issues submitted to Downdetector, a website that tracks user-reported problems with popular online platforms, surpassed 2.1 million on Tuesday, according to data provided to CNN by Downdetector parent company Ookla.\n \n\n   \n  Cloudflare says it handles 81 million HTTP requests – or when web browsers need certain data to trigger an action, such as loading a webpage – per second on average.\n \n\n   \n    Are there really more outages happening lately?\n \n\n   \n  That there have been three widespread outages in less than a month is a coincidence. But Haggerty acknowledged that it certainly feels like these outages are happening more often, mostly because of the scale of their impact.\n \n\n   \n  The number of service outages has “remained consistent,” but the “number of sites and applications dependent on these services has increased, making them more disruptive to users,” Angelique Medina, head of internet intelligence for Cisco ThousandEyes, told CNN in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Cisco’s network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, according to  a timeline published on its website , not counting Tuesday’s Cloudflare disruption.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 23 in 2024, 13 in 2023 and 10 in 2022. A  sweeping Crowdstrike outage  upended businesses, flights and hospitals around the world in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  There are some common trends between outages that occurred in the first half of 2025,  according to Cisco . A string of outages were linked to systems accidentally spreading tech failures, systems that appeared to be functioning properly despite silent issues occurring and configuration changes that cascaded.\n \n\n   \n  While these trends aren’t new, Cisco’s blog post says it’s been “seeing more of these types of disruptions with more far-reaching consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’ll likely happen again.\n \n\n   \n  “They aren’t something you’d say, ‘Well, thank God that would never happen to us,’” said Haggerty. “All of these could actually happen to any business.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/epstein-survivors-house-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:11:00-20:11","title":"‘We have power together’: For Epstein survivors, a day of emotion and triumph","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A day of emotional and political triumph was marked by Epstein survivors in Washington, D.C., who gathered to advocate for the release of Jeffrey Epstein’s files, culminating in a decisive 427-1 House vote in favor of the bill.

Every time someone new arrived, there was an eruption of hugs and cheerful greetings.\n \n\n   \n  The scene could have easily been a joyful reunion of old friends.\n \n\n   \n  But the group was made up of the  survivors of Jeffrey Epstein , forever bonded by their trauma and abuse at the hands of the convicted pedophile. The women had once again descended on Washington, DC, to hold a press conference and plead with lawmakers to  vote to release the Epstein files .\n \n\n   \n  Dani Bensky, who met Epstein when she was a young ballerina, said she had managed to get just a few hours of sleep the previous night. She had spent the evening with the family of the late Epstein victim  Virginia Giuffre , making the most out of the fact that they are rarely in the same place at the same time. It was past midnight when she realized she still hadn’t written out the remarks she would need to make at a press conference just hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “Who writes a speech at one o’clock in the morning the night before? Ai yai yai, rookie mistake on my part,” Bensky said lightheartedly after the press conference, as she quickly made her way to a meeting that was scheduled with a lawmaker. Her fellow survivors, walking alongside her, were quick to reassure her that she had done just fine.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the day, the women stayed close together much like this — there to offer each other pep talks and reminders to drink water and eat; quietly squeezing one another’s hands; and making sure nobody got lost in the maze of hallways on Capitol Hill as they hoped for good news.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can we give you a hug?’\n \n\n   \n  In the late morning, the women found themselves consoling Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina congresswoman walked out into the foyer of her office in the Longworth building in tears. She has been ensnared in a legal battle of her own after  accusing her ex-fiancé  of crimes including physical assault, rape and sex trafficking — allegations he strongly denies.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve given me hope that one day I might get justice,” Mace told the Epstein survivors. “It’s very raw for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “Can we give you a hug?” one woman jumped in to ask.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, I would love a hug,” Mace responded, which prompted several women to take turns embracing the lawmaker.\n \n\n   \n  Mace was one of only four House Republicans to support a discharge petition to force a House vote on the Epstein files. When an Epstein survivor told the congresswoman that the group had been holding their breath and hoping Mace wouldn’t cave to political pressure and abandon her support for the bill, Mace responded: “Yeah, I ran out of fucks to give a long time ago.”\n \n\n   \n  “We rarely get this chance. This moment is historic,” she said. “Women never get this chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell abused her, told CNN it was impossible for her now to imagine going through this experience alone.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time a large group gathers, it completely changes the dynamic and the experience,” Farmer said. “It really does move us from feeling fearful to feeling like we are feared. We have power together.”\n \n\n   \n  Her sister, Maria, is one of the earliest known Epstein accusers. As Farmer made her way from meeting to meeting on Tuesday, more than once, she was on the phone, keeping her sister apprised of developments.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:43 p.m., the gavel came down in the House — the  Epstein bill had passed  on an overwhelming 427-1 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As soon as she stepped out of the House gallery after passage, Farmer was back on her phone, calling Maria to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just incredible to hear her voice and to be able to tell her it passed and it happened and you were such a big part of it,” Annie said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It kills me that she’s not here’\n \n\n   \n  One Epstein victim was not present on Capitol Hill on Tuesday but her presence could be felt everywhere that the group of survivors went.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide in August. In her  posthumously published memoir  released last month, she wrote about having been lent out to an endless stream of wealthy and powerful people. “I believed that I might die a sex slave,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, spoke at the survivors’ press conference and credited his sister for having helped to advance the fight for accountability and transparency, tears streamed down the faces of Giuffre’s fellow victims standing behind Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Sissy,” Roberts said. “You didn’t just make a small dent. You made a monumental impact, a resounding statement that echoed across the world. You built an unbreakable wall, a barrier that will protect future generations from the horrors of abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  Bensky, who credits Giuffre for having shaped her own decision to go public with her Epstein story, said she has wondered what Giuffre would have made of this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It kills me that she’s not here to see it,” Bensky said. “It’s so wrong that she’s just not here. It’s kind of devastating to think that we’re doing this without her.”\n \n\n   \n  Many of the other survivors wore brightly colored butterfly pins on their lapels on Tuesday in Giuffre’s memory. For Bensky and Farmer, their green and pink jeweled brooches were all the more meaningful because they were gifts given to them by Roberts.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia chose the symbol of the butterfly because of the metamorphosis and this real belief she had that there could be post-traumatic growth — that you could go through something like this and come out the other side and have so much to give and share,” Farmer told CNN. “And that’s what she did.”\n \n\n   \n  After the passage of the House’s Epstein bill, the women gathered in the early evening to hold a vigil honoring all of Epstein’s victims, including those who have passed. It was right around when Farmer was paying tribute to Giuffre that Bensky got a whisper in her ear: The Senate had decided to pass the Epstein bill immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the survivors had assumed that the bill’s path through the Senate — and to President Donald Trump’s desk — could be long and arduous and had been preparing for another major battle.\n \n\n   \n  “Words will never ever be able to describe this day,” Bensky said. “We just feel like we never have gotten the win, and we got the win. And that feels so good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/khashoggi-murder-trump-bin-saudi-crown-prince","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:31:00-05:00","title":"Trump claims slain journalist Khashoggi was 'extremely controversial,' defends Saudi crown prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile visit to the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was welcomed with full diplomatic honors, including a military flyover and black-tie dinner, as President Donald Trump emphasized strong personal ties and expanded economic and security cooperation.

controversial,’ defends Saudi crown prince \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:51 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Tuesday angrily dismissed a question about the 2018 murder of  Jamal Khashoggi , claiming the Saudi dissident journalist was “extremely controversial” and insisting the subject was only raised during his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to embarrass his visitor.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he presided over a pageant-filled visit for the de facto Saudi leader.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to insist Prince bin Salman — who the CIA assessed  likely ordered the murder  — wasn’t involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Trump said, turning toward the crown prince.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was the best illustration yet that the period of diplomatic isolation Prince bin Salman endured following Khashoggi’s murder is over. For his first visit to the White House in more than seven years, the crown prince was welcomed with  all the trappings of a state visit , the highest form of American diplomatic reception.\n \n\n   \n  His black Mercedes limousine was escorted onto the South Lawn by a team of dark horses as a military band trumpeted his arrival. A flyover of fighter jets that included F-35s – the jets Trump says he’s planning to sell to Riyadh – blared overhead. Later, Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner in the East Room.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in the Oval Office, Trump heaped praise on the crown prince, including for what he called his “incredible” record on human rights. The president touted new deals on Saudi investments in the United States, and affirmed his plans to sell the American-made jets, even as the crown prince stopped short of committing to some of Trump’s priorities.\n \n\n   \n  And instead of merely glossing over the 2018 murder, which took place at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump took offense that the subject was raised at all during what he intended to be a splashy show of respect.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump told the reporter, longtime ABC White House correspondent Mary Bruce, who questioned him about the murder.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting beside Trump, the crown prince appeared nonplussed by the discussion of his alleged role in the murder, which was committed by Saudi agents who later dismembered the US resident and Washington Post columnist.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” Prince bin Salman said, going on to defend a Saudi investigation afterward.\n \n\n   \n  “About the journalist, it’s really painful to hear anyone that been losing his life for no real purpose or not in a legal way, and it’s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps of investigation” and that “we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.”\n \n\n   \n  Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi’s widow, responded to Trump’s claim that her slain husband was “extremely controversial,” saying that was no reason for him to have been assassinated.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not justification to murder him. Jamal was a good transparent and brave man,” she said in a statement to CNN, adding that “many may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.”\n \n\n   \n  In  an editorial , The Post wrote that Trump’s comments “dishonor Khashoggi’s legacy, stand at odds with the facts and are beneath the office of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The CIA assessment released in 2021 found the prince approved the assassination of the Washington Post columnist, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “We base this assessment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision-making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman’s protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump largely shrugged off Prince bin Salman’s potential role in Khashoggi’s murder, though he described himself as “extremely angry and very unhappy” about the killing.\n \n\n   \n  His successor, President Joe Biden, pledged as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah.” But even Biden came to recognize the kingdom and its crown prince were too powerful and influential to ignore entirely. He flew to the country in 2022 in a mostly unsuccessful attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has actively sought to cultivate his relationship with the kingdom in his second term, visiting Riyadh in May to discuss new investments and security arrangements. His interest in the kingdom has drawn scrutiny for his family’s financial interests in the country, though he dismissed those concerns Tuesday. “I have nothing to do with the family business. I have left,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is that Saudi Arabia eventually joins the Abraham Accords, his signature diplomatic achievement, by normalizing its relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  But Prince bin Salman made clear that wasn’t happening Tuesday, or anytime before a clear pathway exists for an independent Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords,” the crown prince said. “But we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path to a two-state solution.”\n \n\n   \n  So, too, was Prince bin Salman noncommittal when it came to providing funding to help rebuild Gaza. He said he was in “discussion” on the matter before Trump interjected to insist “it will be a lot.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince did say he would increase Saudi Arabia’s investment pledge in the United States from the $600 billion announced in May to $1 trillion – a massive figure that’s nearly the kingdom’s entire yearly economic output.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, seemed eager to provide new American assistance to Saudi Arabia, including a defense pact and an agreement that would help the kingdom develop a civilian nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Mostly, however, he seemed intent on honoring the crown prince, who has consolidated power and is now the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want to thank you,” Trump said. “We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time. We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/human-rights-trump-khashoggi-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Flippant Comments on Human Rights and the Case of Jamal Khashoggi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines Donald Trump’s consistent pattern of downplaying or justifying human rights abuses by authoritarian leaders, from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 to his praise of leaders like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein, Rodrigo Duterte, and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko.

many flippant comments on human rights \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:53 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2018, the  CIA under the first Trump administration concluded  that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the gruesome murder of a US resident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP-led Senate  voted unanimously to condemn  the crown prince. One Republican senator remarked at the time that if the matter went before a jury, the crown prince “would be convicted in 30 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he simply doesn’t care about Khashoggi’s killing all that much. But even by his standards, Trump’s  comments alongside the crown prince  on Tuesday were stunning.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went from downplaying Khashoggi’s murder to vouching for the crown prince (who has denied personal involvement).\n \n\n   \n  While Trump  previously suggested  we’d never know for sure whether the crown prince were guilty, this time he said affirmatively that Prince bin Salman “knew nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  While the president previously gestured suggestively at conservative talking points about Khashoggi’s past associations with Islamist movements (a past that the evidence shows  Khashoggi abandoned ), this time Trump all but said the journalist had it coming. He called Khashoggi “extremely controversial,” and said, “Whether you liked him or didn’t like him, things happen” — as if dismembering someone with a bone saw were just a fluke.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most strikingly, Trump rebuked a reporter for even asking about this in the crown prince’s presence.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Khashoggi’s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, responded to Trump’s comments by saying the journalist’s past was “not justification to murder him.”\n \n\n   \n  “Jamal was a good, transparent and brave man,” she added in comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is hardly the first president to bow to the strategic and geopolitical importance of keeping good relations with Saudi Arabia;  presidents of both parties  have offered tough talk about the Saudis on the campaign trail and then adjusted course once in office.\n \n\n   \n  But what sets Trump apart is his almost complete lack of interest in even  pretending  that he’s factoring human rights into that equation. In fact, he opened his meeting with the crown prince on Tuesday by saying, “What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n \n\n   \n  And this has been a constant throughout Trump’s decade in the national spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of his more remarkable comments on human rights and alleged human rights abusers, mostly from his first term.\n \n\n   \n    2017: Likening US conduct to Vladimir Putin’s political assassinations\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Trump first took office, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly posited to him that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “a killer.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of killers,” Trump  said . “You think our country’s so innocent?”\n \n\n   \n  When Russia’s war in Ukraine began in 2022, Trump initially  praised Putin’s “genius” and “savvy”  in launching the unprovoked invasion, even as Western leaders roundly condemned it. (Trump has since said he’s “very disappointed” in the Russian leader amid the ongoing war.)\n \n\n   \n    2018: Making similar comments about North Korea’s Kim Jong Un\n \n\n   \n  When another Fox host noted that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un executed lots of people, Trump responded: “He’s a tough guy.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed again on Kim  doing “some really bad things,”  Trump  added : “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean, I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes.”\n \n\n   \n    2016: Praising Saddam Hussein for killing alleged terrorists without due process\n \n\n   \n  “He was a bad guy — really bad guy,” Trump, then a presidential candidate,  said  of late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists — over.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Hussein killed lots of people — not just alleged terrorists — without due process. A  2002 State Department report  said he did so “because he believes that their political beliefs, faith, ethnic background, family members or acquaintances are a threat to his power.”\n \n\n   \n    2017: Praising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for his drug war\n \n\n   \n  Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war featured large numbers of extrajudicial killings and was widely condemned by human rights groups.\n \n\n   \n  And not only did Trump not condemn that; he at one point during his first term praised Duterte.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told Duterte during an April 29, 2017, phone call,  according to a transcript  whose basic contents were confirmed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added: “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing, and I just wanted to call and tell you that.”\n \n\n   \n  (A senior US official said at the time that Trump was merely acknowledging the US is combating its own drug problem, not condoning violence and human rights violations.)\n \n\n   \n    2019: Allegedly encouraging China’s Uyghur detention camps\n \n\n   \n  Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in his 2020 book recounted a scene from a G20 summit. In it, Trump and Chinese leader  Xi Jinping discussed the Chinese government’s detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in western China.\n \n\n   \n  “With only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton  wrote . “The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.”\n \n\n   \n  Then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  denied the account , calling it “absolutely untrue” and “completely crazy.”\n \n\n   \n    2025: Praising Belarus’ president\n \n\n   \n  Trump  in a social media post  in August referred to the “highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.”\n \n\n   \n  Lukashenko has long been accused of  egregious human rights abuses  and even  crimes against humanity . He has often been called  Europe’s last dictator  by foreign policy watchers.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Trump’s own State Department in 2020  declined to recognize Lukashenko  as the legitimate president of Belarus, citing a rigged election.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/style/sothebys-klimt-cattelan-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"Rare Klimt painting becomes the most expensive work of modern art ever sold at auction","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking auction at Sotheby’s New York headquarters in November 2025 featured the sale of Gustav Klimt’s 'Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer' for $236.4 million, becoming the most expensive modern artwork ever sold.

They christened Sotheby’s first sale out of its new US headquarters in New York on Tuesday evening in a buzzy, record-breaking night.\n \n\n   \n  Early on, the headlining artwork by Gustav Klimt, “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer,” became the most valuable work of modern art to ever sell at auction, reaching   $236.4 million to gasps and applause from the room during the 20-minute bidding war. It was also the most expensive work of art ever sold by Sotheby’s globally.   The portrait of Klimt’s patrons’ young daughter, made in the last years of the artist’s life, was  spared from destruction  during World War II when it was separated from his works that later burned during a fire at Immendorf Castle in Austria.\n \n\n   \n  The lot was “really one of the last opportunities to acquire a (portrait) of this significance by the artist,” noted the auctioneer, Sotheby’s European chairman Oliver Barker, during the sale. In 2023, Klimt’s final completed portrait, “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan),” sold for $108.4 million.\n \n\n   \n  The portrait of Lederer, which beat out a  previous record  set by a Andy Warhol work in 2022, was part of the collection of Estée Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder, who died earlier this year. Across the sale, most   artworks met or exceeded their high estimates, including an Edvard Munch painting at $35.1 million, and a Klimt landscape at $86 million. The tone was set from the first lot, a sculpture by Alexander Calder that attracted nine eager bidders and sold for nearly triple its high estimate at $889,000. So far, Lauder’s collection fetched $527.5 million, well past its estimate of $400 million — with more to be sold during a separate daytime event.\n \n\n   \n  The collection began a triumphant night for the top end of the art market, which has been experiencing a slowdown for more than two years.\n \n\n   \n  Following the Lauder sale,   the contemporary sale was led by a monumental $48.3 million Jean-Michel Basquiat work. Significantly, however, two of the top lots — one by Kerry James Marshall and another by Barkley L. Hendricks — failed to sell, in a surprising divergence from the evening’s momentum. In addition, the auction’s most unusual offering, the  220-pound, 18-karat gold toilet  by the conceptual artist and enfant terrible Maurizio Cattelan, only drew a single bid.\n \n\n   \n  The opulent sculpture, titled “America,” is a sibling to the infamous version, which was exhibited in the Guggenheim as a working toilet and later stolen from Winston Churchill’s birthplace, Blenheim Palace, and never found.\n \n\n   \n  In a first, the starting bid for “America,” which has been in private hands since 2017, was ideated as a moving target according to the current value of its weight in gold, or $9.9 million and rounded up to $10 million. The pricing was a way to “lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, ahead of the sale. But only one buyer ended up making an offer — a “famous American brand,” per Sotheby’s — and no one followed, implying that bidders decided it wasn’t worth much more than its raw materials. (With fees, it totaled $12.1 million). Considering Cattelan’s satirical sense of humor, it likely amused the artist somewhere in the world.\n \n\n   \n   ﻿ Marquee sales will continue to take place this week, with Sotheby’s hoping to take in more than $1 billion total by the end, based on its high estimates. The pre-sale exhibitions drew crowds to the array of artworks by Basquiat, Yves Klein, Henri Matisse, Cecily Brown and Jeff Koons — as well as lines to Cattelan’s toilet, which was installed on the Breuer Building’s fourth floor in a tiny, mirrored bathroom with a look-but-don’t-touch rule. Sotheby’s new HQ, previously home to the Whitney Museum of American Art and later, an outpost for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s contemporary collection, has signaled a major shift in its public-facing presence, aligning itself just off the city’s famed Museum Mile, where many of its most important institutions reside.\n \n\n   \n  The opening comes at a rocky time for the art market, as global sales of arts and antiques  fell for a second consecutive year  in 2024, according to the latest annual Art Market Report by Art Basel and UBS, and several major brick-and-mortar galleries have shuttered or shifted operations. In May, following the springtime marquee sales in New York, The Art Newspaper  reported  that auction houses Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips saw an 8% slump in sales compared to the year prior, with top lots failing to find buyers or being withdrawn ahead of the sale.\n \n\n   \n  But with the highly successful off-season sale of art collector and patron  Pauline Karpidas’ surrealist works  this summer, as well as reports of mid-market resilience, some analyses have cautiously pointed to a market rebound. Christie’s fared well during its  two-part 20th-century sale  on Monday evening, reaching $690 million with fees — a substantial increase from 2024 — led by a $62 million Mark Rothko painting.\n \n\n   \n  Record-smashing sales of individual artworks exceeding $40 million haven’t been a guarantee this year, but later in the week, Sotheby’s has another rabbit in the hat — a psychologically haunting painting by Frida Kahlo, “El sueño (La cama),” which could break Georgia O’Keeffe’s record for the most expensive artwork publicly sold by a female artist.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with more details of the sale. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/science/semiyarka-bronze-age-eurasia-steppe","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"Archaeologists may have uncovered a Bronze Age metropolis in Kazakhstan’s steppe","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Archaeologists have uncovered a potential Bronze Age metropolis known as Semiyarka in Kazakhstan’s steppe, which may have served as a center of political power, ritual activity, and tin bronze production around 1600 BC.

the early 2000s, but it wasn’t until an international group of archaeologists surveyed the area starting in 2018 that its impressive size and potential importance within the Eurasian Steppe came to light. What the team discovered was an expansive area that was once replete with houses, a central monumental building, which may have been used for rituals or governance, and possibly even tin bronze metal production facilities.\n \n\n   \n  Their findings, published  Monday in the journal Antiquity , are just the beginning, the study authors said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very exciting, because it’s such a rare find to have tin bronze production in this area,” said lead author Miljana Radivojević, an associate professor in archaeological science at University College London, UK. “We know we have hundreds of thousands of tin bronze artifacts from the Bronze Age in the  Eurasian steppe  and we have only one published site on tin bronze production. And this is the second one.” Tin bronze allowed for sturdier tools and other materials to be made, Radivojević added.\n \n\n   \n  As the team now embarks on excavating the area, they say the continued discoveries of Semiyarka are transforming what we know about urban life in prehistoric Eurasia.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t have anything like this at all,” said study coauthor Dan Lawrence, a professor of archaeology at Durham University in the UK. There are hardly settlements of any kind recovered in the steppe, he added. “What you get across this landscape, we associate with mobile pastoral groups, and we think maybe they were in tents or yurts. What we’ve got here is something that’s very clearly quite different.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 140  hectares  (about 346 acres) above the Irtysh River valley, the large size and strategic location of the settlement may indicate that the Bronze Age steppe had sophisticated cities similar to those located in more urban areas of the world at the time, Lawrence added.\n \n\n   \n    Surveying a long-lost city\n \n\n   \n  To find the borders of the settlement, Lawrence led the team in a survey project that looked at satellite imagery and analyzed every 50-meter square across the site. They only examined the surface, finding pottery fragments, including at least 114 ceramic vessels, and other artifacts scattered across the settlement.\n \n\n   \n  The team also used imagery from  Corona spy photography  dating to the 1960s, to identify where the land had been disturbed during the last several decades, as well as magnetometry, a noninvasive survey technique that allowed the archaeologists to see buried structures and metal objects without having to excavate.\n \n\n   \n  The next step, excavations, are underway now, and Radivojević says more discoveries have already been made. “What has been published is that we had indications — we looked at the materials that were crucibles and slags and artifacts, and we could just connect them and say, well, these are the bronzes,” she said. “But then as we go, we have more discoveries, so I was more confident in talking about, say, a larger-scale production of metallurgy on the site.”\n \n\n   \n  But not everyone agrees on whether Semiyarka resembled a major city. “The results, at least those presented in the article, would suggest a strong ‘NO’ to that question, especially given the low-density pottery sherd scatter on the surface and seemingly equally low-density evidence for metallurgy,” James Johnson, an archaeologist and assistant instructional professor in anthropology at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, said in an email. Johnson, who has studied Bronze and Iron Age pastoralist societies of the Eurasian steppe, was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Cities are spatial and demographic entities that usually represent the complex interplay of the built environment, population density and sprawl, and material culture (as well as numerous other sociological factors),” he added. The low number of ceramic artifacts found could indicate a limited use of pottery, common among prehistoric steppe societies, and that pottery might not be “the best material culture category to connect with population density usually associated with urban populations.”\n \n\n   \n  Further research into the middens, heaps of remains that provide a glimpse into past human life, as well as surface collections beyond the settlement would help archaeologists better understand settlement patterns, Johnson said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lawrence agrees that there isn’t enough evidence to conclude that the settlement was a major city, “I also think we can’t say it is a strong no for the same reasons,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The relatively small amount of pottery remains can be attributed to the fact that the ground is undisturbed and compacted by several feet of snow every winter; many artifacts could still be underground, Lawrence noted.\n \n\n   \n  He continued: “Different things happen in urban settlements than in the rural ones. For example, in modern times you need to go to a city to get heavy industry, fancy shops or a seat of political power. I think we can say that Semiyarka is a city in the sense that it is very different from surrounding settlements and provides just those kinds of urban services.”\n \n\n   \n  Semiyarka could be evidence that the region found a balance between the typical pastoralist mobile sites and other important societal elements, such as tin bronze production, one of the most important technologies of the time, said Michael Frachetti, a professor of archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n \n\n   \n  “Although the archaeological scale and function of these central places is still unfolding, the results so far open many questions about the organizational choices steppe societies made in terms of metallurgy, political organization, and economic connectivity at both local and regional scales,” Frachetti said in an email. Frachetti, who specializes in pastoralism in the Bronze Age, was also not involved with the study.\n \n\n   \n    In search of answers\n \n\n   \n  There is not a lot of evidence of settlements in the Eurasia steppe during the Bronze Age; most sites were mobile, and did not leave behind a lot of archaeological evidence, Lawrence said. However, the grasslands haven’t received much archaeological attention, he added, and it’s possible there are many settlements still left to be uncovered\n \n\n   \n  With future research, the study authors said they hope to find further evidence of Semiyarka’s potentially powerful role during the Bronze Age, as well as insight into urban life and metal production within the steppe.\n \n\n   \n  As of now, their research has revealed the outlines of at least 15 structures throughout the settlement, with a few showing evidence of being houses with internal rooms.\n \n\n   \n  How many people lived there? How long did the settlement survive? What connections did the city have to other areas? Lawrence hopes that the excavation process will turn up answers.\n \n\n   \n  “This site is super interesting because it just breaks from all the things that we thought we knew about Central Asia up to this point,” Lawrence said. “And so understanding how that got there, why that got there, and then how it connects to these much larger stories is really interesting, and it’s not something we can answer yet, but now we know the site’s there, we can start to develop a program to try and understand what it all means.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/roman-surovtsev-ukraine-deportation-hope","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-20:46","title":"Dallas dad came to terms with his imminent deportation.

Then an 11th-hour court order gave hope to see his family again \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:26 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Saturday evening, Samantha Surovtsev squinted at her phone, blinking through tears as she rushed to order a set of Eastern European power adapters. Despite the 80-degree North Texas heat, she then drove to Old Navy and bought two bulky winter coats.\n \n\n   \n  When the adapters arrived Sunday, she tucked them into a suitcase alongside the coats and wool socks and drove everything to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Alvarado.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband,  Roman Surovtsev , was inside. The 41-year-old had been there for 109 days, after being unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with ICE in August. Surovtsev had been convicted of armed carjacking when he was 19 and was released from prison in 2014 before a six-month stint in ICE custody. The run-in cost him his permanent resident status.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was swept up again in ICE detainment as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration, an effort stretching across the country from  Charlotte  to  Portland , fracturing families and communities.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office, Trump has implemented policies to deport undocumented migrants en masse. ICE agents have been  directed  to detain and arrest people at  work ,  courthouses,   churches and schools  as part of the administration’s  deportation push .\n \n\n   \n  Now the husband and father of two was a day away from boarding a deportation flight with dozens of other detainees to war-torn Ukraine, a country he hadn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Surovtsev’s case. In a Monday post on X, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Surovtsev a “criminal illegal alien” with “a history of violence,” citing carjacking and burglary charges alongside a number of other offenses of which he hasn’t been convicted.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday night, he used the center’s tablet to call his wife, family and in-laws to say what he believed were his final goodbyes. Immigration officials wouldn’t tell Surovtsev, his attorneys or Samantha when or where specifically he was being removed, citing security concerns, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  All they could do now was wait.\n \n\n   \n  Monday passed in agonizing quiet. Samantha sat by the phone for hours, waiting for confirmation that the worst had happened, that Surovtsev had been officially deported.\n \n\n   \n  His immigration attorney finally called at 3:29 p.m. She stepped outside, away from the sounds of her young daughters playing inside.\n \n\n   \n  “The stay has been granted,” the attorney told her. The flight full of detainees would still leave for Ukraine, but he wouldn’t be on it.\n \n\n   \n    ‘God’s timing is perfect’\n \n\n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was born in the former Soviet Union in 1984 and fled to the US legally with his mother and two siblings when he was 4 years old. Although they found relief from Soviet rule in their new country, he grew up in poverty and instability.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle in California. In prison, he was baptized, a turning point that transformed him, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County, and the two eventually married, bought a home outside Dallas, launched a painting business and started a family. Surovtsev has never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  When Samantha hung up with the attorney on Monday, her heart racing, she rang the tablet at the detention center.\n \n\n   \n  “Are you listening?” she asked Surovtsev when he picked up. “They issued the stay, and they’re reopening your case.”\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers thought it would take two to three months to hear from a judge about the motion to reopen his case, which they filed November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev wept. “God’s timing is perfect,” he told her.\n \n\n   \n  “We had accepted that Roman would be on that plane, and I was thinking about what our lives are going to look like and if we could ever get to him again,” Samantha said. “And suddenly, it’s all reversed, because there’s still hope.”\n \n\n   \n  She spent the rest of the day telling family and friends the news.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as Samantha tucked their daughters into bed, her 5-year-old asked if they could call dad. For months, Samantha had told the girls that their father was simply “at work.”\n \n\n   \n  When he picked up the tablet, the two talked excitedly about all the things they planned to do when Surovtsev came home. He promised her he would build a massive Barbie dollhouse to go into the attic playroom he made for his girls.\n \n\n   \n  His daughter squealed with excitement.\n \n\n   \n    Decades of legal battles, time served and reform led to the stay\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014 when an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported. He lost his green card, and he was placed into ICE custody, but the agency ran into trouble removing him from the country.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship given that Surovtsev was from a region of Ukraine that’s at war and not readily reachable, and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 on an order of supervision without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six months. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans in between starting his own business and building a family.\n \n\n   \n  His unexpected detainment during a routine check-in on August 1 mobilized Samantha, who rallied a team of lawyers to represent him.\n \n\n   \n  His counsel was able to successfully vacate Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, on the grounds that he received ineffective counsel back in 2014, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said. This empowered his attorneys to file a motion earlier this month to reopen his old criminal case in hopes of getting it dismissed.\n \n\n   \n  In the 11th hour on Monday, just before he was to board the deportation flight bound for Ukraine, a court in California agreed to hear his case and ordered a stay of his removal, barring the US government from deporting him.\n \n\n   \n  “Respondent has demonstrated new, material evidence to warrant reopening of these proceedings,” the order, reviewed by CNN, reads. “His convictions were vacated pursuant to California Penal Code 1473.7(a)(1), specifically due to constitutional defects in the underlying criminal proceedings, so Respondent met his ‘heavy burden’ to show that his evidence ‘would likely change the result’ in his case.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev will remain in detention while the court proceedings play out.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re just thankful that plane took off without him, and that the judge ruled the way she did, because all we wanted was time for our case to be heard. And we got it,” Samantha said.\n \n\n   \n  But Surovtsev’s team has acknowledged that the fight isn’t over.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s next is making sure that not a single other Ukrainian who’s in detention is sent back to that country,” said Eric Lee, one of Surovtsev’s attorneys.\n \n\n   \n    The flight carrying dozens of detainees still took off for Ukraine, attorneys said\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s relief while his court proceedings play out comes at a bittersweet moment for his legal team and other families. Some deportees boarded Monday’s flight and are now in Ukraine, his attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n  “However many people were ultimately successfully deported to Ukraine are probably fighting for their lives right now,” said Lee. “We’re glad at least one person was prevented from going on that flight, but we’re very upset about all the others and very, very sorry for their families.”\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been in contact with several other families with loved ones who were deported on Monday’s flight. None of them have been able to get ahold of them yet, she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  One family is tracking their deportee’s phone, with an app showing it on the move inside Ukraine, Samantha said. But he’s not answering their calls, and they’re not sure if he still has his phone.\n \n\n   \n  Another detainee has a background similar to Surovtsev – a USSR child refugee who got into trouble as a teenager, served his sentence and moved through adulthood with a supervision order from ICE, his attorney Ann Peters said. Her client, who also narrowly missed being deported Monday, is the primary caretaker of his brother, a paralyzed Marine Corps veteran.\n \n\n   \n  As Samantha and other detainees’ families sit in legal limbo during what feels like an endless pursuit to see their loved ones again, Samantha said the Bible verse Romans 8:31 is keeping her warm.\n \n\n   \n  “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/americas/brazil-supreme-court-sentences-military-officials-lula-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00-05:00","title":"Brazil’s Supreme Court Sentences Military Officials for Plotting to Kill Lula","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil’s Supreme Court has sentenced nine high-ranking military officials and one federal police officer to prison for their roles in a plot to assassinate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, as part of a broader attempt to overthrow democratic rule through violent means.

At the time, the panel also sentenced other close allies who justices said formed part of the “core group.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the panel convicted those accused of planning the criminal organization’s violent actions, which included a plot to kill Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice  Alexandre de Moraes .\n \n\n   \n  Of the 10 defendants forming part of this group, nine are high-ranking military officers and one a member of the federal police.\n \n\n   \n  The four-justice panel unanimously convicted nine of them, acquitting a retired general due to insufficient evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Seven of them were convicted of attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, attempted coup, participation in an armed criminal organization, aggravated damage and deterioration of listed heritage.\n \n\n   \n  Two were convicted of the less serious offences of criminal association and public incitement of animosity between the Armed Forces and constitutional authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Sentences ranged from 1 year and 11 months to 24 years, with four defendants handed down time behind bars of more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “Brazil, once again, due to the irresponsibility and lack of patriotism of some, flirted with and almost fell into a chasm of institutional darkness,” Justice Flávio Dino said as he cast his vote, in a reference to Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985).\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just a walk in the park. It was a coup that was going to arrest and kill people, revoke the constitution, citizenship and the free press. And these are not conjectures: it was written in the planning seized from these various public agents,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet pointed to evidence that a federal police officer infiltrated the security team of the then president-elect to enable the group’s violent plans.\n \n\n   \n  The plan didn’t advance due to the Army commander’s lack of support, according to Moraes, who is overseeing the sprawling coup case.\n \n\n   \n  Those convicted will only start serving time once appeals are exhausted.\n \n\n   \n  That’s also the case for Bolsonaro, who has been under house arrest since August.\n \n\n   \n  The panel recently rejected an appeal filed by the former president’s legal team, but another one could be submitted this week.\n \n\n   \n  Bolsonaro’s trial made global headlines. US President Donald Trump ordered a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and cited in part Bolsonaro’s case, which he called a “witch hunt.”\n \n\n   \n  That triggered a sharp deterioration in US-Brazil relations, which experts described as the lowest point in their more than 200-year history.\n \n\n   \n  Relations have improved.

Is that a conflict of interest? And, your royal highness, the US intelligence (community) concluded you orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist. 9/11 families are furious that you are here in the Oval Office. Why should Americans trust you? And the same to you, Mr. President.”\n \n\n   \n  Before Bruce could complete the question, Trump repeatedly asked, “Who are you with?”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m with ABC News, sir,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Fake news,” Trump claimed, deriding one of the best-known news brands in America as “one of the worst in the business.”\n \n\n   \n  “But the question is important, sir,” Bruce said, unfazed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to claim that he has “nothing to do with the family business,” then spoke dismissively about Khashoggi, calling the dissident journalist “ extremely controversial .”\n \n\n   \n  Prince bin Salman said Khashoggi’s murder has “been painful for us in Saudi Arabia” and defended the Saudi investigation into the crime.\n \n\n   \n  Karen Attiah, who edited Khashoggi’s columns for The Washington Post, wrote on Bluesky that Trump’s comments about the slain journalist were “absolutely vile.”\n \n\n   \n  Minutes later, when Bruce asked an unrelated question about “the Epstein files,” Trump berated her for having an unpleasant “attitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the way you ask these questions,” he said. Circling back to the Khashoggi question for the prince, he said, “You start off with a man who is highly respected, asking him a horrible, insubordinate, and just a terrible question. And you could even ask that same question nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Then he tore into ABC, calling it a “crappy company,” and raising the specter of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  The FCC regulates the licenses of local TV and radio stations nationwide, including those owned by ABC. But the national network is not licensed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly spoken of wanting to revoke licenses, which would break with decades of precedent and likely spark lengthy legal battles.\n \n\n   \n  Sen.

Mike Braun responded by threatening to “compel” the Senate into a special session to vote on redistricting at Trump’s behest.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest chapter in an  escalating intraparty battle in Indiana  over the White House’s monthslong effort to bolster the party’s US House majority in time for next year’s midterm elections. Republicans now hold seven of Indiana’s nine US House seats, and Trump is seeking new maps that would give the GOP a shot at a 9-0 sweep.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana takes on more urgency for national Republicans after  a federal court invalidated Texas Republicans’ new map  that would have given them a better shot at gaining five new seats. While Texas officials immediately moved to appeal the ruling, losing that prospective five-seat gain could put the GOP multiple seats behind Democrats in the redistricting battle Trump triggered.\n \n\n   \n  However, despite Trump taking to social media this week to threaten to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting, there were no signs at the statehouse on Tuesday that the opposition would yield.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a legislator 42 years. I’m not going to change my vote,” said Sen. Vaneta Becker, an Evansville Republican who told CNN her office has received more than 750 calls opposing redistricting and 37 in favor.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in blackmail position. It does not bode well,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers gathered in Indianapolis for “organization day” — the long-planned ceremonial start to the 2026 legislative session. The Senate voted 29-19 to meet again on January 5, a vote that implicitly rejected Braun’s call for a redistricting-focused special session.\n \n\n   \n  Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, a Martinsville Republican who infuriated Trump when he issued a statement saying the Senate does not have enough votes to pass new maps,  told reporters Tuesday that the adjournment vote was “fairly indicative of the vote that you might have seen” if the Senate had voted on new congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump this week has threatened to back primary opponents to take on Bray, who isn’t up for reelection until 2028, and other Republicans who opposed redistricting, arguing that they are standing in the way of the GOP retaining its majority on Capitol Hill for the last two years of Trump’s presidency. Braun responded later Tuesday afternoon with a statement backing Trump’s primary threats and suggesting he will seek to force the Senate into session to vote on redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Sen. Rod Bray was forced to partner with DEMOCRATS to block an effort by the growing number of America First Senators who wanted to have a vote on passing fair maps. Now I am left with no choice other than to explore all options at my disposal to compel the State Senate to show up and vote,” Braun said in a statement. “I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Monday posted on Truth Social: “A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.”\n \n\n   \n  Bray on Tuesday said he has had “a couple conversations” with Trump about redistricting and said he is “honored to talk to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him, as I tried to explain to you guys today, that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. And this is the best way forward, as we see it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bray argued that even without new maps, Republicans have a chance to win the 1st District, a traditionally blue seat in northwestern Indiana, and hold eight of Indiana’s nine House seats.\n \n\n   \n  “A number of our caucus members, myself included, don’t see this as a binary choice between the 7-2 ratio that you have right now and redistricting into an automatic 9-0,” Bray said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his political allies had launched an advertising pressure campaign aimed at forcing the state Senate’s hand.\n \n\n   \n  Some veteran Republican legislators said the primary threats rang hollow because of their constituents’ near-unanimous opposition to redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers are very thoughtful, and I know for myself, I represent my constituents,” Becker said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that “it’s not a good look for legislators, in my opinion, to kowtow to that.”\n \n\n   \n  But state Sen. Mike Young, a veteran Indianapolis Republican, took to the floor Tuesday to lambast Bray for refusing Braun’s call for a special session. Young said it was “a slap in the face of the governor of the state of Indiana to do something like this.”\n \n\n   \n  “Imagine waking up on Wednesday, the day after elections next November, and we find ourselves in the minority by one or two votes … knowing that we have the opportunity to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Young said. “Elections have consequences, and we won.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/gluesenkamp-perez-garcia-retirement-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:26:00-05:00","title":"House reprimands Democratic congressman accused of subverting election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives reprimanded retiring Democratic Representative Chuy García for allegedly attempting to subvert the election of his successor by retiring just after the filing deadline to ensure his hand-picked chief of staff, Patty Garcia, would win the seat.

Chuy García — for what some of his colleagues have described  as an attempt to subvert the election of his successor  in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  What made it even more surprising: It was a fellow Democrat who triggered the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington has infuriated fellow Democrats for her surprise decision last week to force the House to take up the symbolic resolution against García. The Illinois Democrat, first elected in 2018, is under attack for allegedly coordinating his own retirement to ensure his hand-picked replacement would win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Garcia announced his retirement shortly after his state’s filing deadline on November 3 — after his chief of staff had declared her own candidacy. That meant the staffer, Patty Garcia, was the only Democrat running in a primary for a deep-blue Chicago seat he has held since 2019. She is now all but guaranteed to win his seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  Only 22 Democrats voted with Gluesenkamp Perez to reprimand Garcia, along with 213 Republicans. The move has enraged many House Democrats, who argue that their colleague, the moderate Democrat from Washington, is choosing to embarrass their party at a time when it is already sharply divided over ideological lines in the wake of this month’s shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It shouldn’t have caused as much friction as it did to speak honestly and consistently about election subversion. Congress is a legislative body, not a social club, and the American people will not accept blind calls to party loyalty in defense of an effort to deny them the right to a free and fair election,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement after the vote. “Representative Chuy García has had a long career of public service, and he is retiring for honorable reasons, but election subversion is wrong no matter who’s doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Jeffries and Democratic leaders had been  blindsided by Gluesenkamp Perez’s move , which she announced, without informing leadership, the same day the House voted to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his leadership team had sought to stifle the effort, and while the Democratic leader did not formally whip his members, he and his leadership team made clear they did not support it.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not going to run, you don’t choose your successor — no matter the work you have done beforehand,” Gluesenkamp Perez said on the House floor Monday night, condemning Garcia’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  The Illinois Democrat, however, has sharply disputed the allegations. His office has said his abrupt decision to retire came after he received troubling health news, alongside other family matters, such as his recent adoption of a grandchild after the death of his daughter in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis,” Garcia’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leaders issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday defending Garcia and condemning the “misguided” measure, after unsuccessfully trying to kill the effort earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “(Garcia) is a good man who has always prioritized the people he represents, even while experiencing unthinkable family tragedy. We unequivocally oppose this misguided resolution and urge our colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus to reject it,” the statement from Jeffries and his leadership team read.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday if he had concerns about Garcia’s actions, Jeffries argued that it was not an issue that was important to everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people are focused on the high cost of living in the United States of America. That’s what they’re focused on,” Jeffries said, before adding: “I strongly support Congressman Garcia.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/three-mile-island-restart-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:11:00Z","title":"Trump administration lends $1 billion to restart Three Mile Island nuclear reactor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has loaned $1 billion to Constellation Energy Corp to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania, a move tied to rising energy demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

on Tuesday it has loaned Constellation Energy Corp $1 billion to restart its nuclear reactor at a Pennsylvania plant formerly known as Three Mile Island.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation  signed a deal  in late 2024 with Microsoft to restart the 835-megawatt reactor, which shut in 2019, and which would offset Microsoft’s data center electricity use. The other unit at the plant, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, shut in 1979 after an accident that chilled the nuclear power industry.\n \n\n   \n  U.S. power demand is now rising for the first time in two decades on technologies including artificial intelligence. Nuclear energy, which is virtually carbon-free, has become an option for technology companies with uninterrupted power needs and climate pledges. Critics point out that the U.S. has failed to find permanent storage for radioactive waste.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Beard, head of the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, or LPO, said the restart would support the PJM regional grid. “This type of energy is important because it’s large, stable, affordable base load power,” Beard told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said the loan will help it lower the cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore power to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  The LPO has more than $250 billion in capital, and “a large portion of that we expect to be deployed to help reinvigorate the large-scale nuclear reactor development,” Beard said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this month that the bulk of the LPO money would go to nuclear projects.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation in June had moved up the timeline to restart the reactor by about a year to 2027 after PJM fast-tracked its review process to connect the project to the grid.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation said it has hired hundreds of workers, completed infrastructure inspections and ordered major equipment for the reactor. It will need to revamp cooling towers, install a main power transformer among other equipment, and re-fuel before producing electricity.\n \n\n   \n  It was the first time the LPO declared that a company had met all conditions for a loan and closed it at the same time, Beard said. Constellation is guaranteeing the loan, he said, and that loan structure would protect taxpayers if the project does not succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Constellation is an “investment-grade” established nuclear operator that could have gotten a bank loan without the government’s help, Beard said. “But we want to show support for affordable, reliable, stable, secure energy in the U.S., as directed by President (Donald) Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The plant also needs U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and water-related permitting, Constellation said this year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-happens-next-epstein-bill","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00-05:00","title":"Here’s the Epstein bill’s possible path in the Senate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed the U.S. House with near-unanimous support, is now moving to the Senate, where it faces little resistance due to bipartisan momentum.

introduced, a bill directing the Department of Justice to publicly release all its Jeffrey Epstein-related files passed the House on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the measure passed with near-unanimous support, it still has to pass a few hurdles before it becomes law and files are ultimately released.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what could be next for the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n \n\n   \n    The bill’s possible path in the Senate\n \n\n   \n  The legislation now moves to the Republican-led Senate, where its once-uncertain path now seems clearer.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune said he expects his chamber to take the measure up “fairly quickly” – perhaps even later Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he would move to pass the bill by unanimous consent later Tuesday, and Thune acknowledged that could be successful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the kind of thing, probably, that could perhaps move by unanimous consent,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s not likely the Senate will make any changes, despite House Speaker Mike Johnson’s public request that the chamber do so.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the president has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it is, is in the cards,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  If it doesn’t pass by unanimous consent, Democrats would need a few Republican senators to vote with them for the bill. A  similar measure  led by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley has two Republican cosponsors, GOP Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, as of Tuesday, according to Merkley’s office. But momentum is now fully behind the House-passed measure and Thune said his team was “hotlining” it.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson had previously told reporters he was “very confident” the Senate would methodically consider the bill and amend it to better protect people’s privacy. If the Senate were to make changes and pass the legislation by a simple majority, the House would then need to vote again on the Senate-amended version.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, the bill’s main sponsor, argued that any such change could be “just another delay tactic,” and that he felt its privacy protections were adequate as-is.\n \n\n   \n    If the bill passes the Senate\n \n\n   \n  A Senate-passed bill without changes would go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his approval.\n \n\n   \n  If the Senate were to amend it, the bill would moves to Trump’s desk after the Senate version was again passed by the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  has said  he will sign the bill into law. But he could also change his mind and choose to veto the bill, which would then require a two-thirds vote to override the president’s veto. He could also decide not to act on the bill, allowing it to become law without his signature.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the the bill becomes law, some lawmakers – like GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who long backed the measure – have questioned whether the Department of Justice would release the files or if the information would remain tied up in ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has not directed the department to do so, according to an official familiar with the matter. But generally, the department resists giving Congress files during an ongoing criminal investigation because any public release could jeopardize the integrity of the probe or any resulting criminal case. And it’s unclear how the agency might respond if the measure was passed by Congress and signed into law.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/middleeast/israeli-strikes-palestinian-refugee-camp-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:00-05:00","title":"Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon kills 13 people, Lebanon’s health ministry says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed 13 people and injured several others.

event in New York on Tuesday meant to draw attention to what some are saying is the  plight of Christians in Nigeria .\n \n\n   \n  The rapper was introduced by President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz and began her remarks by expressing her nervousness and thanking both Waltz and Trump. She then said it was “an honor” to be present “to shine a spotlight on the deadly threats faced by thousands of Christians in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stand here as a proud New Yorker with a deep sense of gratitude that we live in a country where we can freely and safely worship God regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics,” she said. “No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion, like I recently stated on social media. And we don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The US president  recently sparked alarm in Nigeria  after he said he was considering military action there and would cease aid over what he claimed was the Nigerian government’s failure to protect Christians from a  “mass slaughter” by Islamist insurgents in the African nation.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have said the situation is  more nuanced than presented by the US president , with both Christians and Muslims being victims of violence by Islamic extremists.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government also rejected Trump’s comments. “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Calling Nigeria “a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions,” Minaj noted in her address on Tuesday that some of her devoted fanbase, known as the Barbz, live there.\n \n\n   \n  “I am joined here today by peace builders, by faith leaders, by those who saw violence, saw intolerance, saw the threats clearly before us and chose not to look the other way,” Minaj said. “I am inspired by their work to build interfaith ties, to see the humanity across the lines which might divide us and to vie and to fight for security and liberty for all those who pray.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz shared how Minaj’s invitation to speak at the US mission in New York came about in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday morning, saying she was asked to speak after expressing support of a Truth Social post from Trump in connection with the Nigeria issue. “To our astonishment, she accepted,” Waltz said. “She is reaching a whole other swath of people who may not follow these issues, and it’s going to be a great day.”\n \n\n   \n  Waltz  wrote earlier this week  that the rapper “is not only arguably the greatest female recording artist, but also a principled individual who refuses to remain silent in the face of injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful she’s leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria, and I look forward to standing with her as we discuss the steps the President and his administration are taking to end the persecution of our Christian brothers and sisters,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj  posted about her gratitude  for the invitation on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Ambassador, I am so grateful to be entrusted with an opportunity of this magnitude,” she wrote. “I do not take it for granted. It means more than you know.”\n \n\n   \n  She also referenced her fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “The Barbz & I will never stand down in the face of injustice,” Minaj wrote. “We’ve been given our influence by God. There must be a bigger purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Minaj, who recently made headlines because of an explosive online beef with fellow rapper Cardi B, has offered her admiration for Trump before.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, she  shared a screenshot on X  of Trump’s Truth Social post about Nigeria and his plans to act, writing, “Reading this gave me a deep sense of gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a country where we can freely worship God,” she wrote. “No group should ever face persecution for practicing their faith. We don’t have to share the same beliefs to respect one another.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House TikTok account this month joined the viral “Beez In The Trap x What’s Up?” remix, which combines the 1992 4 Non Blondes hit “What’s Up?” with Minaj’s 2012 “Beez In The Trap.”\n \n\n   \n   The White House video  featured scenes of Trump and first lady Melania Trump along with the remix.\n \n\n   \n  Minaj responded in the comments on the video by thanking the Trumps and saying, “This is pretty incredible.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/education-department-trump-administration-changes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:37:00Z","title":"Trump Administration Accelerates Push to Dismantle Education Department as it Offloads Work to Other Agencies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has accelerated its effort to dismantle the Department of Education by transferring major offices to other federal agencies—such as Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, and State—under an interagency agreement.

Interior.\n \n\n   \n  Administration for Children and Families Relating to the CCAMPIS Program and the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation will move to HHS and International Foreign Language Education will go to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Education Department official said the agency is “still exploring” the best plan for other offices, like the Office for Civil Rights, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and Federal Student Aid – divisions whose functions impact a wide swathe of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  McMahon, who has acknowledged that only Congress has the power to eliminate the department, on Tuesday touted the changes as “one essential piece of our final mission.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we partner with these agencies to improve federal programs, we will continue to gather best practices in each state through our 50-state tour, empower local leaders in K-12 education, restore excellence to higher education, and work with Congress to codify these reforms,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  According to a congressional source briefed on the changes, the moves are taking place under an agreement in which personnel are sent to other agencies, but technically the Department of Education has some oversight and leadership over them.\n \n\n   \n  The senior education official referred to the arrangement as “co-management” of the shifted offices, adding that the policy and oversight will stay with the Department of Education but the process, particularly with getting grants out the door and monitoring them, will be the responsibility of the partner agency.\n \n\n   \n  There is no effective date for transitioning some staff to the other agencies nor numbers on how many staff would make the physical move from their offices at the Department of Education.\n \n\n   \n  The senior official said there would be a lag time before the changes are fully executed.\n \n\n   \n  “We are really confident that this will end up being something that provides better services, more streamlined services, reduces bureaucracy and in shifting some of these responsibilities to co-management with other agencies we are necessarily narrowing the size and scope of this federal agency in line with the president’s executive order,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents more than 2,700 Education Department employees, said the plan was unlawful and warned against diffusing the agency’s functions throughout the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “This move comes as the Administration has attempted to fire large numbers of career public servants in these very offices — and is now trying to shift their critical work to agencies with no educational expertise,” AFGE Local 252 President Rachel Gittleman said in a statement, warning that the changes “will only create more confusion for schools and colleges, deepen public distrust, and ultimately harm students and families.”\n \n\n   \n  The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten echoed concerns about the impact on students.\n \n\n   \n  “This move is neither streamlining nor reform–it’s an abdication and abandonment of America’s future,” she said in a statement. “Rather than show leadership in helping all students seize their potential, it walks away from that responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to build upon the president’s campaign promise to shutter the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Early on in his second term, the administration cut  nearly half of the department’s workforce  as an initial effort to shutter it.\n \n\n   \n  The mass layoffs at the department were initially blocked by lower courts until the  Supreme Court  in July said the administration could proceed for now.\n \n\n   \n  The department, which was created by Congress in 1979 when Jimmy Carter was president, is  tasked with distributing  federal funds to schools, managing federal aid for college students, and ensuring compliance with civil rights laws, including ensuring schools accommodate students with disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  Most public-school policies, meanwhile, are a function of state government.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n

Clay Higgins, the only lawmaker to vote against the bipartisan bill to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, defended his opposition on Tuesday, saying the legislation was written in such a way that it might harm innocent people.\n \n\n   \n  “It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,” he  wrote on X  after casting his vote against the bill.\n \n\n   \n  While other Republicans had voiced similar concerns about the measure – including House Speaker Mike Johnson – Higgins’ decision to formally vote against it represented a remarkable break from the rest of the House, which  passed the measure 427-1 . Senate Republican leader John Thune said soon after that he expects his chamber to take the measure up “fairly quickly” – perhaps even later Tuesday – and Trump has indicated he would sign it into law.\n \n\n   \n  But Higgins, a member of the House Oversight Committee from Louisiana, noted that panel’s “thorough” Epstein probe, and indicated he would only support the House-passed bill if it came back with changes from the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Senate amends the bill to properly address privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House,” Higgins said.\n \n\n   \n  That does not appear likely. While Johnson said that he had spoken with Thune about amending the bill after it passes in the House so that it better protects survivors, Thune indicated that his chamber was unlikely to make changes.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, when a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1, and the president has said he’s going to sign it, I’m not sure that amending it is, is in the cards,” Thune said.\n \n\n   \n  Higgins told CNN’s Manu Raju last week that he planned to vote against the bill even as the tide turned and more Republicans said they would back it.\n \n\n   \n  He told Raju that Trump didn’t have a “good relationship” with Epstein and denied that the president was trying to kill the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the White House and the president, it’s people that stand for long-standing criminal justice procedures that this bill does not observe.

18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the  bulk of the job growth. \n \n\n   \n  Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to the  Kansas City Fed , but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s infuriating,” Scheffel said.\n \n\n   \n  High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM’s employees preoccupied with their own finances.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of our employees are distracted. They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.”\n \n\n   \n  Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are  living paycheck to paycheck , meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance  has surged by 120%  for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So much anxiety’\n \n\n   \n  Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to  estimates  released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.   \n \n\n   \n  Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the  Supreme Court rules  against the Trump administration’s use of  emergency powers to justify  its global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”\n \n\n   \n    High borrowing costs\n \n\n   \n  Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the SBA  estimates  it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.\n \n\n   \n  Small business  optimism increased  sharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump’s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration crackdown shrinks labor pool\n \n\n   \n  One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker’s: attracting talent.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to find workers. We can’t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.\n \n\n   \n  McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don’t get the job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees’ resilience in the face of uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/texas-redistricting-trump-court-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Federal court bars Texas from using new Republican-friendly US House map in midterms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal court has blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map for the 2025 midterms, ruling that it likely constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

Texas announced it would appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The court ordered Texas to use its previous map, which the state enacted after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  If the ruling stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  The new Texas map aimed to help Republicans flip five Democratic-held House seats next year, and it kicked off a rush of redistricting efforts from both parties across the country. The Justice Department has joined a similar challenge to the new Democratic-drawn map in California enacted in direct response to Texas aiming to flip five Republican-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  With House Republicans currently holding just a three-seat majority, the five seats at play in Texas could make the difference in who wins control of the House next year.\n \n\n   \n  California Democrats launched their redistricting effort in response to Texas Republicans, and an initial version of their plan would have only taken effect if Texas or another state enacted a map. But the  final ballot measure passed by California voters  contained no such trigger.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, wrote that the challengers were “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.”\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel that heard the case split 2-1, with Obama appointee David Guaderrama joining Brown. Reagan appointee Jerry Smith opposed the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican.\n \n\n   \n  US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday, “We strongly disagree with today’s district court ruling on Texas’s redistricting map - Texas’s map was drawn the right way for the right reasons.”\n \n\n   \n    Judge criticizes a letter Trump’s DOJ sent to Texas\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s ruling centers on a letter the Trump administration sent to Texas in July in which Harmeet Dhillon, who heads the civil rights division at the Department of Justice, warned of potential legal action over the state’s map because of what it called “unconstitutional” coalition districts, or districts with a non-White majority but where no single racial group makes up a majority.\n \n\n   \n  While Brown calls DOJ’s assertion “legally incorrect,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cited the letter when he added redistricting to a special session he’d scheduled for the legislature.\n \n\n   \n  “In doing so, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to draw a new U.S. House map to resolve DOJ’s concerns. In other words, the Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The map ultimately passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor—the 2025 Map—achieved all but one of the racial objectives that DOJ demanded,” Brown wrote. “The Legislature dismantled and left unrecognizable not only all of the districts DOJ identified in the letter, but also several other ‘coalition districts’ around the State.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown skewered Dhillon’s letter in his decision, writing that it’s “challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Indeed, even attorneys employed by the Texas Attorney General—who professes to be a political ally of the Trump Administration—describe the DOJ Letter as ‘legally() unsound,’ ‘baseless,’ ‘erroneous,’ ‘ham-fisted,’ and ‘a mess,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Even if states aren’t required to draw certain types of districts such as coalition districts under federal civil rights law, Brown wrote that they aren’t prohibited from doing so.\n \n\n   \n  “Nor is it lawful for a legislature to purposefully target such districts for destruction,” Brown wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Before being appointed to the federal bench, Brown served for nearly two decades as a state judge, culminating in six years on the Texas Supreme Court, the state’s highest civil court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott  celebrated  Brown’s appointment in 2019, noting that the judge had started his career as a law clerk for the governor when he was himself serving on the state Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Abbott said that he had “witnessed firsthand” Brown’s and another nominee’s “sharp legal minds and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Abbott ripped Brown’s ruling without naming the judge. He said it was “clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats who fought the GOP-led effort – including by  leaving the state  to delay the passage of the map – celebrated Brown’s ruling.\n \n\n   \n  “A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, who leads the Texas House Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    The national redistricting battles play out in court\n \n\n   \n  The legal wrangling over efforts by Democrats and Republicans across the country to enact rare, mid-decade congressional maps will continue to play out in coming weeks and months. Last week, the Justice Department sued officials in California over newly enacted maps meant to give Democrats in the Golden State an edge next year. A court is set to hear arguments in that case next month.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys with the department are arguing that California’s redistricting plan, which was approved by voters in early November, was sold as a purely partisan effort, when in fact “the focus was not partisanship, but race,” which they say would be impermissible under the US Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps with a nod to the likelihood that Tuesday’s action would likely end up before the US Supreme Court, Brown began the panel’s ruling on the Texas maps by quoting Chief Justice John Roberts  in a 2007 opinion : “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n \n\n   \n  To date, Republican-drawn maps across four states, including Texas, have targeted a total of nine Democratic-held seats. Six of those seats have been held by Black or Latino lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the Republican redistricting efforts have argued that the GOP’s hunt for a partisan advantage in Congress has improperly diluted the voting power of racial and ethnic minorities.\n \n\n   \n  “The state of Texas is only 40 percent white, but white voters control over 73 percent of the state’s congressional seats,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. “It’s quite obvious that Texas’s effort to redistrict mid-decade, before next year’s midterm elections, is racially motivated. The state’s intent here is to reduce the members of Congress who represent Black communities, and that, in and of itself, is unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Texas ruling points to one of the remaining legal tools available to groups challenging redistricting efforts.\n \n\n   \n  While the Supreme Court ruled in a 2019 case that partisan gerrymandering could no longer be challenged in federal court, the opinion left open the possibility of challenging racial gerrymanders, including those that violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a crowning achievement of the civil rights era.\n \n\n   \n  Civil rights groups say the law has reduced racial discrimination and expanded the number of minority lawmakers not only in Congress but also in state legislatures and even schools boards.\n \n\n   \n  But the ability to bring those suits is now under threat because of a pending case from Louisiana. In that litigation, Louisiana v. Callais, a group of White voters claim that the state violated the Constitution by drawing a second Black-majority district. In other words, they argue that the 14th Amendment shouldn’t allow states to consider race when attempting to fix discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s 6-3 conservative majority signaled deep reservations with Louisiana’s new congressional map when the court  heard oral arguments in the case  in October. But it was far less clear whether the court would strike down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act entirely or seek to modify it instead.\n \n\n   \n  Just two years ago, the high court rejected similar claims raised by Alabama. In that case, a majority of the court  ordered Alabama officials to redraw  the state’s congressional map to allow an additional Black majority district.\n \n\n   \n  A decision in the Louisiana case is expected next year.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00Z","title":"Trump’s Plan for Gaza Endorsed by UN Security Council","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council passed a 13-0 resolution (with abstentions by Russia and China) endorsing a U.S.-drafted plan based on Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza initiative.

Trump’s plan for Gaza endorsed by UN Security Council \n       \n  By Billy Stockwell, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:17 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council passed a  US-drafted resolution  Monday that aims to move beyond the fragile truce in Gaza to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  The 15-member council voted 13 to 0 in favor of the resolution, with abstentions by Russia and China, which declined to use their veto power to block the measure.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution was intended to add international legitimacy to US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza plan , parts of which formed the basis of the ceasefire that took effect in the Gaza Strip last month. The United States had lobbied hard for its passage, which was praised by Trump in a lengthy post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,” Trump wrote Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the establishment of the “Board of Peace” as a transitional authority and the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday that “the members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.”   \n \n\n   \n  Some diplomatic sources said the resolution will help grant the authority for countries to participate in the ISF, as it will now have UN backing.\n \n\n   \n  US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said Monday that the ISF, “a strong coalition of peacekeepers, many from Muslim majority nations like Indonesia, Azerbaijan and others,” will deploy to Gaza “under a unified command” in order to “secure Gaza streets … oversee demilitarization … protect civilians and … escort aid through safe corridors.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had acknowledged the need for an “international mandate” to support the plan. Ahead of the vote, Waltz warned that “a vote against this resolution is a vote to return to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the resolution has passed, many questions remain about its implementation, with the draft appearing vague on sequencing and detail.\n \n\n   \n  Western diplomatic sources have told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect. It has faced scutiny for lacking a clear timeline for the transitional authorities to hand over to the Palestinian Authority, saying only that it will do so once the PA “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.” The resolution authorizes the Board of Peace and other authorized “international civil and security presences” until the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution states that the Board of Peace will oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand – and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the resolution also contains a reference to Palestinian statehood, but it provides no timeline for it.\n \n\n   \n  “After the (Palestinian Authority) reform program is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft said.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The representative from Russia, one of the two UN Security Council members to abstain from the vote, said it was important that the resolution not become “a death knell for the two state solution.” A representative of China, the other member to abstain, argued that “it seems Palestine is barely visible in it, and the Palestinian sovereignty and ownership are not fully reflected.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls on UN member states and international oragnizations to work with the Board “to contribute personnel, equipment, and financial resources to its operating entities and the ISF, to provide technical assistance to its operating entities and the ISF, and to give full recognition to its acts and documents.”\n \n\n   \n   Hamas said Sunday that it considered the draft resolution “an attempt to impose international guardianship over Gaza and promote a vision biased toward the occupation.”\n \n\n   \n  After Monday’s vote, Hamas said that giving any stabilization force “tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality and turns it into a party to the conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians in Gaza were also wary of the resolution, fearing that international forces inside Gaza could do more harm than good for the people trying to rebuild their lives in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  “Those who are supposed to come now, God willing, may they improve everything for these people,” 38-year-old Um Shadi Al Balbasi told CNN on Tuesday. “But if they come and end up like the ones before them, no. They must be better than those who came before, because the situation, I’m telling you, is absolutely unbearable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Waltz said after the passage of the resolution that the Board of Peace “will coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, facilitate Gaza’s development and support a technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza civil service and administration while the Palestinian Authority fully implements its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have not expanded in detail on what that reform program would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called Monday’s resolution “quite an incredible moment in world politics that could only have been carved out by President Trump, and of course, bringing back all our hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to enable a future of hope, and I hope this resolution of the Security Council, plus people-to-people activities and new initiatives … should lead, hopefully, to some sort of a positive outcome,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/karen-read-massachusetts-police-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00-05:00","title":"Karen Read Files Lawsuit Alleging 'Gross Misconduct' by State Police Shielding Real Killers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Karen Read, who was found not guilty of murder charges in the 2022 death of Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe, has filed a civil lawsuit alleging gross misconduct, conspiracy, and malicious prosecution by the Massachusetts State Police and several individuals connected to a house party where the incident occurred.

him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in Canton, a suburb about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Boston. She was  been charged  with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene.\n \n\n   \n  A  mistrial was declared  last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. In the second trial, a jury found her not guilty of second degree murder and manslaughter charges but did find her guilty of a lesser charge of drunken driving.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s lawsuit was filed against several members of the state police and most of the people at the house party including federal agent Brian Higgins, Nicole and Brian Albert, whose owned the house, and Jennifer and Matthew McCabe. It raises many of the allegations Read’s defense team made during her two trials.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges O’Keefe was killed at the house party during an “altercation during a late night house party with other defendants after a night of heavy drinking.” It says there was a vast conspiracy by members of a well-connected and close social group in the house to cover up the crime. It also accused investigators of shoddy police work, manufacturing evidence and failing to investigate the house for blood, DNA or other evidence or interview anyone at the house.\n \n\n   \n  “The House Defendants responsible for Mr. O’Keefe’s death — some of whom had professional experience with police investigations — concocted a plan immediately after the altercation to avoid culpability and frame Ms. Read,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that state police investigators allowed those defendants to redirect the investigation away from themselves and toward Read.\n \n\n   \n  In statement from their attorneys, Higgins, the McCabes and the Alberts denied the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The allegations made by Karen Read are entirely false, defamatory, and without merit,” they said in a statement. “Our clients categorically deny each and every claim. This lawsuit is nothing more than a continuation of a baseless conspiracy narrative that has caused significant harm to the reputations and lives of innocent people. Our clients acted responsibly, fulfilling their civic duty as witnesses, and have participated appropriately in the legal process from the outset.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit also alleges the investigation, led by former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was biased from the start. Proctor was fired after sharing offensive and sexist texts about Read with friends, family and co-workers. During the second trial, Read’s defense attorney Alan Jackson argued Proctor’s “blatant bias” tainted every aspect of the corrupt and flawed investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the Karen Read Civil Team said she “was dragged through a baseless criminal prosecution engineered by individuals who abused their authority, manipulated the investigative process, and trampled her rights.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our complaint lays out, in stark detail, the malicious prosecution, the conspiracy, the civil-rights violations, and the intentional misconduct that these defendants visited upon an innocent woman,” the team added.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, among other things, alleges malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment and conspiracy to deprive Read of her Fourth Amendment rights. Her lawyers are demanding a jury trial.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:47:00-05:00","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have initiated an unprecedented mid-decade effort to redraw state congressional maps in order to protect and expand their narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started.\n \n\n   \n  Not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps. In Indiana, the Republican leader of the state Senate  says there isn’t enough support  to redistrict in that state. Despite that announcement, Republican Gov. Mike Braun has continued to call for the legislature to vote on a new map.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has  sued California over its newly enacted map , which was drawn by Democrats and aims to effectively wipe out potential gains made by Republicans in Texas by helping the party flip five GOP seats in the Golden State. The map was approved overwhelmingly by voters earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/ntsb-dali-bridge-collapse","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"14:37:00-05:00","title":"A misplaced wire label caused a power outage on a massive container ship, sending it crashing into a bridge, the NTSB finds","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small wiring error—caused by a mislabeled wire on the container ship Dali—led to a chain of failures, including a 58-second power loss and failure to restart a key pump, ultimately resulting in the ship crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on March 26, 2024.

massive container ship, sending it crashing into a bridge, the NTSB finds \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:37 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small label installed on a wire when a giant cargo ship was built may have triggered a chain of events nearly a decade later, causing the ship to slam into a bridge and collapse into the water.\n \n\n   \n  The National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting Tuesday to determine the probable cause of the container ship Dali crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and its subsequent collapse, killing six people.\n \n\n   \n  On March 26, 2024, the 213-million-pound cargo vessel Dali lost engine and electrical power as it was leaving the Port of Baltimore and struck a pillar of the Key Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is, none of us should be here today,” said Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the NTSB, in her opening remarks. “This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost, as with all accidents that we investigate, this was preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB said Tuesday it believes a label was put in the wrong place on a signal wire when the ship was built. That sticker, identifying the line, kept the wire from getting a good connection in a circuit breaker – which in turn ultimately caused the first blackout.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, according to Marcel Muise, the NTSB’s investigator in charge, the vessel lost steering, the ability to operate the bow thruster, key water pumps, and most of the vessel’s lighting and equipment essential for operations. That first outage lasted 58 seconds.\n \n\n   \n  The crew onboard the Dali quickly found the tripped breaker, the NTSB said. Power came back within 58 seconds, but restarting a key pump that would have provided fuel to generators had to be done manually, and that didn’t happen.  When the generators ran out of gas in their lines, the result was a second blackout.\n \n\n   \n  “To restart it, you would have to go two levels down in near total darkness with a flashlight from the engine control deck to the purifier room on the fourth deck,” Homendy said.\n \n\n   \n  The pump being used was designed to flush out lines for maintenance, but it had been operating for at least seven months. Since it was not intended to be used in this way, it did not have a backup.\n \n\n   \n  When the pump needed to be restarted, the Dali was just three ships’ lengths from the bridge and despite the pilots reacting properly, they couldn’t regain control in time to avoid hitting it, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  At the conclusion of Tuesday’s meeting, the board will vote to determine the probable cause of the crash and approve a final report.\n \n\n   \n    A critical minute and 29 seconds\n \n\n   \n  Six construction workers filling potholes on the bridge when the ship slammed into the bridge support might not have been killed if they had been notified to evacuate, the NTSB said in the hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The road crew was in their vehicles on the bridge when it collapsed, sending the trucks tumbling into the water. A seventh worker, who was with them, was injured in the collapse but survived. An inspector, who was outside of his vehicle walking the length of the bridge, ran to safety as it collapsed behind him.\n \n\n   \n  As the Dali veered toward the bridge, the ship notified the Maryland Transportation Authority which shut down traffic on the bridge 48 seconds before impact. The agency also had the inspector’s cell phone number, but did not warn him of the impending collision.\n \n\n   \n  “Had the highway workers been notified of the Dali’s emergency at the same time as the MDTA police officers, there would have been about 1 minute and 29 seconds to evacuate before pier 17 collapsed,” said Scott Parent, a highway factors engineer for the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  The force of the impact was nearly five times greater than the structural capacity of the pier, investigators said.\n \n\n   \n    One loose wire among thousands\n \n\n   \n  There were thousands of wires on the Dali, and the one loose wire that caused this incident would not have been easily found by the crew.\n \n\n   \n  “The Dali is almost 1,000 feet, and it’s as long as the Eiffel Tower,” Homendy said. “It’s high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Locating a single wire that is loose among thousands of wires is like looking for a loose bolt in the Eiffel Tower.”\n \n\n   \n  Over the decade since the ship was built, the wire was exposed to vibrations and movement on the ship, which ultimately caused the disconnection, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an intermittent electrical issue failure, meaning it didn’t fail all the time,” said Barton Barnum, senior marine engineer with the NTSB.\n \n\n   \n  Barnum said the NTSB left the failed system configured the way it was during the incident. The wire became disconnected again during the investigators’ simulation.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re talking about a very small component here and this is what caused all the problems,” said Thomas Chapman, NTSB board member. “The poor connection within this terminal block is what started the sequence of events that resulted in the blackout.”\n \n\n   \n  It would have been nearly impossible to check every connection, but thermal imaging would have helped identify the problem in a shorter timeframe, the NTSB noted.\n \n\n   \n    Bridge was at risk of collapse in a collision, but no one knew\n \n\n   \n  The Key Bridge had nearly 30 times the acceptable level of risk for critical bridges of collapse if it were hit, based on guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, NTSB officials said. But no one knew that before the collapse, because the owner of the bridge, the Maryland Transportation Authority, never evaluated that risk.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the NTSB also identified 68 other bridges in 19 states spanning waterways frequented by cargo ships that, like the Key Bridge, were built before 1991 and do not have a current vulnerability assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Among those on the list are the Golden Gate Bridge in California; Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, George Washington and Verrazzano-Narrows bridges in New York City; the Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin bridges in Pennsylvania; the Sunshine Skyway in Florida and the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  The Maryland Transportation Authority on Monday  said  in a release the updated cost estimate to replace the Key Bridge is now projected to be $4.3 billion to $5.2 billion, with an expected opening in late 2030 – a two-year delay from the earlier estimate.\n \n\n   \n  That price tag is more than double the previous expected cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, which the Maryland Department of Transportation  previously confirmed  to CNN.\n \n\n   \n    17 Safety Recommendations\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB also proposed 17 safety recommendations to prevent another similar crash.\n \n\n   \n  The groups receiving the recommendations, including the ship’s owner, bridge owners, Coast Guard, American National Standards Institute, and others are not required to follow the recommendations, but are strongly encouraged to.\n \n\n   \n  “Our hearts are with you as we work diligently over the next several days, weeks, months and years to make sure our safety recommendations are implemented and to ensure that this never happens again so another family never has to suffer the same pain that you all have suffered,” Homendy told family members of victims in the crowd as she closed Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed to this report.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/meta-antitrust-suit-decision-not-monopoly","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:22:00Z","title":"Meta Scores a Win After Judge Rules the Social Media Giant Is Not an Illegal Monopoly","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, James Boasberg, ruled that Meta is not a monopoly in the social media market, dismissing the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust claim that the company used acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition.

monopoly \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:22 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Meta scored a major win on Tuesday after a federal judge ruled that it is not a social networking monopoly, shooting down an argument from the US Federal Trade Commission that it should be forced to spin off two of its most popular platforms.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Trade Commission  sued Meta  in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law by acquiring nascent, would-be rivals Instagram and WhatsApp to avoid having to compete with them. The seven-week trial in the case saw testimony from a series of prominent figures, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who argued that the company has plenty of competition from platforms including YouTube and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  Federal judge James Boasberg agreed with the company’s argument in his Tuesday opinion, saying that TikTok and YouTube prevent Meta from monopolizing the social network market.   He also noted that Meta’s apps and the social media landscape have changed since the FTC filed its case, most recently because of AI-generated content, which undermined the agency’s arguments.   \n \n\n   \n  “Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  FTC Director of Public Affairs Joe Simonson said in a statement that the agency is reviewing its options following the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply disappointed in this decision,” Simonson said. “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment. We are reviewing all our options.”\n \n\n   \n  A forced breakup would have been a major loss for Meta, which heavily relies on Instagram for ad revenue and WhatsApp for business subscriptions and its international prominence. Although Meta boasts 3.3 billion daily users across its platforms, Zuckerberg’s testimony during the seven-week trial  indicated that the app  with which he founded the company, Facebook, is declining in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  “The Court’s decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,” Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead said in a statement provided by spokesperson Nkechi Nneji. “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”\n \n\n   \n  The ruling also marks a win for Silicon Valley as US regulators increasingly seek to crack down on the power of Big Tech. Google was recently ruled a monopoly in two separate cases related to its  search  and  online advertising  businesses.  Apple  and  Amazon  are also fighting antitrust cases brought by the government.\n \n\n   \n  Meta, then known as Facebook, acquired  Instagram in 2012  for $1 billion and  WhatsApp in 2014  for $19 billion.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lawyers for the FTC  pointed  to emails and internal documents that they said showed that Zuckerberg was concerned about competition from Instagram and WhatsApp prior to the acquisitions. They claimed that Meta’s large user base reflected a lack of “reasonable alternatives” for consumers in the social media space.\n \n\n   \n  Meta argued that regulators approved the acquisitions years ago when they were made, and that a forced breakup could harm American competitiveness in the tech space.\n \n\n   \n  Boasberg’s ruling argues that Meta’s apps hold only a “modest share” of total time spent in the social media market — which includes Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, MeWe, TikTok and YouTube — and that its share is falling. He added that “even if YouTube is excluded (from the relevant market), Meta still would not hold a monopoly.” (Boasberg’s opinion redacts the specific market share he believes Meta to hold.)\n \n\n   \n  “TikTok — which Meta considers its fiercest competitor — broke into the market only seven years ago … and has been overrunning the market ever since,” Boasberg wrote.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details and context.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/brian-walshe-trial-case-charges","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:08:00Z","title":"Brian Walshe pleads guilty to lesser charges related to death of his wife as murder trial begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brian Walshe, a 50-year-old man from Cohasset, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to lesser charges—misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body—related to the disappearance and alleged murder of his wife, Ana Walshe, a 39-year-old corporate real estate manager and mother of three.

\n  By Lauren del Valle, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:08 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Massachusetts man about to be tried for the  murder and dismemberment of his wife  pleaded guilty to lesser charges on Tuesday – but the trial went on nonetheless.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe, 50, pleaded guilty to misleading police and improper conveyance of a human body related to the death of his wife, Ana Walshe, a corporate real estate manager and mother of three. Not long after, jury selection began in his murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  In Norfolk County Superior Court Tuesday morning, Walshe’s attorney made clear he is not admitting to murdering his wife.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe pleaded guilty to the lesser charges without a plea deal from prosecutors. Prosecutors refused to negotiate, according to a defense filing, “unless negotiations included the indictment charging murder.”\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe is prepared to admit to the recitation of facts with respect to the indictment that the government just read in so far as it alleges he did impede and obstruct the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Ana Walshe. We obviously object, and he’s not admitting to … murder,” attorney Kelli Porges said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search for Ana Walshe, 39, was launched after her employer reported her missing on January 4, 2023, and her husband told investigators he’d last seen her leaving their Cohasset, Massachusetts, home for a work trip on New Year’s Day.\n \n\n   \n  He was arrested on January 8 and charged with misleading police, and later that month he was charged with her murder.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Walshe faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on the misleading police charge, with up to a 20-year sentence enhancement if convicted of murder. He faces up to 3 years in prison on the conveyance charge.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate federal case, Walshe pleaded guilty to charges connected to selling forged Andy Warhol artwork. He’s serving a 37-month prison sentence that’s set to run concurrently with his prison time for the state case connected to his wife’s death. He’s been in state detention since his arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Ana Walshe’s body has not been found, but investigators recovered trash bags of evidence they allege Brian Walshe threw away, containing a hacksaw, a hatchet, and several items with Brian and Ana Walshe’s blood and DNA on them, prosecutors have said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators uncovered a series of chilling internet searches they say Brian Walshe made from his young son’s iPad including: “How long before a body starts to smell?” and “How to stop a body from decomposing,” according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  At the hearing Tuesday, Walshe acknowledged the prosecutors’ allegations and confirmed to the judge that he disposed of her body.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Walshe, did you in fact, willfully remove or convey the body of Ana Walshe or her remains, not being lawfully authorized to do so?” Judge Diane Freniere said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, Your Honor,” Walshe responded.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Brian Walshe killed his wife because he  wanted to end their marriage  and that he lied to investigators about some of his actions and whereabouts in the days following her disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  After Walshe’s arrest, his  defense attorney noted  no body has been found and said there was “no indication of if she died, how she died” and no murder weapon or motive established.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said they plan to call up to 60 witnesses in the state’s case against Walshe.\n \n\n   \n  Freniere last week ruled Walshe was competent to stand trial after he spent a 40-day stint in a state hospital for mental health evaluation. The judge had delayed the trial – previously set for October 20 – so Walshe could undergo the evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys lobbied for the trial delay after he was stabbed in jail in September, expressing concerns that Walshe could not adequately assist in his defense after the attack.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the judge said she’s accepted a physician’s report deeming Walshe competent after the evaluation period.\n \n\n   \n  Walshe’s attorney Larry Tipton said in open court the defense did not contest his competency.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day jury selection was supposed to start.

In fact, some have grown so popular that they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s CNN Travel’s rundown of some of the top Christmas markets taking place around the world this year:\n \n\n   \n    Wiener Christkindlmarkt, Austria\n \n\n   \n  With a reindeer train, a giant Ferris wheel and a giant Advent wreath, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Austrian capital holds around 20 Christmas markets, Wiener Christkindlmarkt (or Rathausplatz) is one of its oldest and most traditional events.\n \n\n   \n  The event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, is held in front of City Hall and features a 110-square-meter children’s ice rink. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of stalls   offer tasty treats such as Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.\n \n\n   \n   Wiener Christkindlmarkt  runs from November 14 to December 26.   The ice rink, or Ice Dream at the Christmas Market, will be open until January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  Most Swiss towns are taken over by festive markets at this time of year, and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around.\n \n\n   \n  Separated into two sections, at Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz, it hosts around 150 decorated stalls selling everything from Christmas spices, decorations and candles.\n \n\n   \n  Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Münsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star-making workshop and a puppet show.\n \n\n   \n  Attendees can take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for views of the lights illuminating the old town or sip on mulled wine at the Christmas pyramid on Barfüsserplatz.\n \n\n   \n   Basel Christmas Market  opens on November 27 and is scheduled to run until December 23. \n \n\n   \n    Strasbourg Christmas Market, France\n \n\n   \n  One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets,  Strasbourg’s  began back in 1570, but has evolved considerably since then.\n \n\n   \n  Spread over more than 10 locations, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling lights and festive ornaments.\n \n\n   \n  Drawing in over 2 million people a year, it features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine.\n \n\n   \n  Place Kleber is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares.\n \n\n   \n   Strasbourg Christmas Market  begins on November 26 and closes on December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Brussels Winter Wonders, Belgium\n \n\n   \n  Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market.\n \n\n   \n  One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the open spaces of the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons.\n \n\n   \n  A light and sound show, ice skating and fairground rides are among the activities and places to enjoy. Visitors can also browse through about 200 chalets serving  glühwein  (mulled wine), Belgian beers and waffles while staring in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree in Grand Place.\n \n\n   \n   Brussels Winter Wonders  will run from November 28  to January 5. \n \n\n   \n    Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic\n \n\n   \n  To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.\n \n\n   \n  Old Town Square provides entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops. Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats such as klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.\n \n\n   \n   The markets will be open from November 29 to January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Fira de Santa Llucia, Barcelona\n \n\n   \n  Dating from 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the December 13 feast day of Santa Llucia to a three-week fair.\n \n\n   \n  Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four sections.\n \n\n   \n  The first is Nativity and Figurines, where visitors can pick up decorations and models to create traditional Bethlehem manger scenes. The Greenery and Plants section is packed with both natural and artificial trees and, of course, plants.\n \n\n   \n  The Crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while the Simbombes section is mainly made up of musical instruments.\n \n\n   \n  There are also many festive activities such as storytelling, a Christmas parade and the  Caga Tió , an enormous, piñata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick.\n \n\n   \n   Fira de Santa Llucia  will be taking place from November 28 to December 23. \n \n\n   \n    I Mercati Natale, Piazza Santa Croce, Florence\n \n\n   \n  There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica.\n \n\n   \n  Although this traditional fair, also known as Weihnachtsmarkt, is based on German street markets, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many local treats, such as panforte, for sale.\n \n\n   \n  However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies.\n \n\n   \n  Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8.\n \n\n   \n   I Mercati Natale  begins on November 15 and runs to December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Advent in Zagreb, Croatia\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years.\n \n\n   \n  Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight.\n \n\n   \n  Think live Nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves.\n \n\n   \n  Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment.\n \n\n   \n   Advent in Zagreb 2025  is scheduled to run from November 29 to January 7. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark\n \n\n   \n  Visited several times by Walt Disney before he developed Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year.\n \n\n   \n  But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s line up of activities also includes a magical light installation of luminous “fireworks.”\n \n\n   \n  The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas in Tivoli  is taking place from November 14 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia\n \n\n   \n  The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets.\n \n\n   \n  Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale.\n \n\n   \n  On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors are also treated to performances by dance troupes and choirs.\n \n\n   \n  But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441.\n \n\n   \n   Tallinn Christmas Market 2025  is due to take place from November 21 to December 28. \n \n\n   \n    Skansen’s Christmas Market, Stockholm\n \n\n   \n  Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen.\n \n\n   \n  Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic.\n \n\n   \n  The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion, and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can join the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site.\n \n\n   \n   Skansen’s Christmas Market  is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 28 until December 21. \n \n\n   \n    Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki\n \n\n   \n  This wonderfully Nordic Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue.\n \n\n   \n  Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies,  glögi  (Finland’s take on mulled wine) and handicrafts are also a big draw.\n \n\n   \n  Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities such as Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive with a host of top eateries from which to choose.\n \n\n   \n   Tuomaan Markkinat  is set to run from November 28 to December 22, 2025.  \n \n\n   \n    St. Stephen’s Basilica and Vörösmarty Square markets, Budapest, Hungary\n \n\n   \n  Budapest has two main festive markets: St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or  Advent Bazilika , and Vörösmarty Square Christmas market.\n \n\n   \n  The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Vörösmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts more than 800,000 visitors annually.\n \n\n   \n  Its main highlight is usually a giant Advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the  Hungarian foods that line its stalls — langos and chimney cake — are also particular standouts.\n \n\n   \n   Advent Bazilika opens on November 14 and runs to January 1. \n \n\n   \n   The Vörösmarty   Square Christmas market will open on November 14 and close on December 31. \n \n\n   \n    Christkindlesmarkt and Gendarmenmarkt, Germany\n \n\n   \n  Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets.\n \n\n   \n  Capital city Berlin has around 80 of them, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned.\n \n\n   \n  Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with special Christmas gifts. Visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances.\n \n\n   \n  In Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stalls are erected in the city’s central market square, and the whole area is abuzz with activity.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually draws in around 2 million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights.\n \n\n   \n   Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 202 5  kicks off on November 28 and ends on December 24. \n \n\n   \n   Gendarmenmarkt   opens on November 24 and is set to close on December 31 .\n \n\n   \n    Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, London\n \n\n   \n  Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital.\n \n\n   \n  The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus fairground rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can also join ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus show, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village.\n \n\n   \n   Hyde Park Winter Wonderland  is scheduled to open on November 14 and will continue until January 1, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Edinburgh at Christmas, Scotland\n \n\n   \n  From an ice rink to immersive light displays, the Scottish capital’s historic city center is abuzz with festive markets and attractions throughout winter.\n \n\n   \n  Over in popular urban park East Princes Street Garden, there’s a traditional Christmas market with up to 70 stalls, a Ferris wheel and an 80-meter star flyer fairground ride — the world’s largest transportable star flyer.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers are treated to spectacular views of the iconic Scott Monument, along with Edinburgh Castle, where the after-dark Castle of Light attraction will be held from late November to early January.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a Christmas tree maze can be found at St. Andrew Square Garden and new attraction, the Ice Queen’s Castle, which features ice carvings and wall etchings, will be erected on George Street, one of the city’s top shopping spots.\n \n\n   \n   The Christmas market at East Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh’s main festive market, will be open from November 15 until January 4, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Krakow Christmas Market, Poland\n \n\n   \n  Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as  kiełbasa  (sausage), shop for handcrafted gifts or treats and take in live music from folk bands and carol singers.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually hosts a competition in which participants, including schoolchildren and local artists, create small Nativity scenes, or cribs. They are displayed at the statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, situated in the square, before a winner is chosen.\n \n\n   \n   Krakow Christmas Market  will be held from November 28 to January 1 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Bratislava Christmas Fair, Slovakia\n \n\n   \n  Dotted across various locations around the Slovakian capital, including the Main Square and Franciscan Square, the Bratislava Christmas Fair is a  magical affair.\n \n\n   \n  With stalls selling everything from mulled wine to traditional delicacies, a huge Christmas tree and live performances, the annual market showcases some of the best traditions of the Slovakian Christmas season.\n \n\n   \n  While there are various ways to reach the main event, a ride on the free Christmas tram, which runs through the city center throughout the festive period, is probably the most fun method.\n \n\n   \n   Bratislava Christmas Fair  will be held from November 27 to January 6. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore\n \n\n   \n  Now in its 12th year, Singapore’s Christmas Wonderland is continuing to grow in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Staged at the famous Gardens by the Bay nature park, the event lasts around four weeks and covers more than 27,000 square meters.\n \n\n   \n  Packed with attractions, it features fairground rides, a Christmas train, light and sound shows, carnival games and live performances.\n \n\n   \n  The Spalliera, a magnificent design inspired by Mesola Castle in northern Italy is one of the main highlights, along with the stunning Walk of Lights, which is illuminated by countless bulbs.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay   opens on November 29 and closes on January 1. \n \n\n   \n    The Distillery Winter Village, Toronto\n \n\n   \n  Formerly known as the Toronto Christmas Market, the Distillery Winter Village is an intimate and charming take on the traditional European festive market.\n \n\n   \n  Held in the historic Distillery District, it features outdoor shopping cabins and food vendors, Christmas carol sing-a-longs, and a special village inspired by “Bad Hats’ Narnia,” an adaptation of C.S. Lewis’s “The Lion, the witch and the Wardrobe.”\n \n\n   \n  Visitors will be able to find everything from artisanal food, handcrafted gifts and festive drinks at the numerous stalls across the market.\n \n\n   \n   The Distillery Winter Village 2025  will be open on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 13 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Winter Village at Bryant Park, New York\n \n\n   \n  Every year, Manhattan’s Bryant Park is transformed into a magnificent wonderland for the Winter Village.\n \n\n   \n  The renowned open-air market includes over 150 custom-designed kiosks and a 17,000-square-foot outdoor ice rink that’s free to use provided you have your own skates. Its rinkside bar and food hall The Lodge provide an eclectic mix of eateries, alongside an outdoor beer garden and a cocktail bar.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the Winter Village, the Josephine Shaw Lowell Fountain is at its most beautiful during winter time, when it regularly freezes over.\n \n\n   \n   The Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park  opened on October 24 and will run through to March 1, 2026. The Holiday Shops by Urbanspace will be open up until January 4, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Christkindlmarket Chicago\n \n\n   \n  First launched in 1996, Christkindlmarket Chicago takes inspiration from the historic Christkindelmarkt in Nuremberg, Germany, bringing a taste of traditional German Christmas markets to the Windy City.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the hugely popular market will be staged across three locations — Daley Plaza in Chicago, RiverEdge Park in nearby Aurora and Gallagher Way in Wrigleyville.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can expect live entertainment alongside a multitude of stalls selling everything from bratwurst and hot spiced wine, to hand-crafted ornaments.\n \n\n   \n  Admission is free, but those attending the Daley Plaza market who are keen to skip the crowds have the option to purchase a $25 fast-entry pass on weekends.\n \n\n   \n   Christkindlmarket Chicago   at Daley Plaza will run daily from November 21 to December 24.  \n \n\n   \n   Christkindlmarket Chicago  at RiverEdge Park will run daily on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 21 to December 24. \n \n\n   \n   Christkindlmarket Wrigleyville  at Gallagher Way  will be open daily from November 23 to December 31 (the market is closed on December 25)\n \n\n   \n  The information in this article was current at the time of publishing.

President Donald Trump’s attempt to revive a defamation lawsuit against CNN, calling his arguments “meritless.”\n \n\n   \n  The 2022 suit objected to CNN’s use of the phrase “the big lie” in reference to the president’s lies about the 2020 election being “stolen.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a three-judge appellate panel affirmed  a Florida judge’s 2023 ruling  that said Trump failed to prove “falsity,” a necessary element to demonstrate that someone has been defamed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s conduct — when he lost the 2020 election but claimed he won, and attempted to stay in power — is “susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s,” the judges wrote. Thus, it is “not readily capable of being proven true or false.”\n \n\n   \n  Judges Kevin Newsom and Elizabeth Branch, who were appointed by Trump, and Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was appointed by Barack Obama, wrote that “Trump’s other arguments are likewise meritless.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for CNN declined to comment on the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court decision reaffirms that American news outlets tend to prevail when they stand their ground rather than settle out of court with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Settlement deals between Trump and major media companies like Disney and Paramount have drawn widespread criticism over the past year.\n \n\n   \n  The original suit against CNN was filed by Lindsey Halligan and Jim Trusty, two of Trump’s personal lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  Trusty withdrew from the case eight months later, however, citing “irreconcilable differences” with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan has remained in Trump’s inner circle and is now the interim US attorney overseeing the Eastern District of Virginia. Her appointment has been challenged in court.\n \n\n   \n  The original lawsuit also accused CNN of associating Trump with “Adolf Hitler and Nazis,” sometimes by citing comments made by guests on TV shows.\n \n\n   \n  The district judge assigned to the case, Raag Singhal, said those were statements of opinion, not fact: “Bad rhetoric is not defamation when it does not include false statements of fact.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump then appealed to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against him on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Trump’s legal team responded by to the loss by saying, “There is no doubt that Fake News CNN defamed President Trump and all of the tens of millions of Americans who have rightly stated that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged and stolen by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers. President Trump will continue to hold the mainstream media accountable and will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/bitcoin-price-crypto-stocks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Why crypto is melting down and stocks keep falling","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bitcoin and US stock markets are experiencing significant volatility in November 2025, with Bitcoin plunging over 26% from its record high above $126,000 to trade below $93,000, entering a bear market and wiping out more than $600 billion in market value.

Not helping: uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.\n \n\n   \n  In Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market — when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin’s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,” said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.\n \n\n   \n  After a strong six-month rally in stocks, nerves are mounting about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. A wide range of tech and AI stocks were lower on Tuesday: Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 2.81%. Amazon shares ( AMZN ) fell 4.43% and Microsoft shares ( MSFT ) fell 2.7%.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 6.6% since hitting a record high late October and has shed roughly $2.6 trillion in market value during its slide.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 10% on Tuesday.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  hovered in “extreme fear” and slid to its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin bear market\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure on bitcoin: Long-term investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,” said Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since a  flash crash  on October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to volatility, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor — namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,” Chung said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin’s roundtrip — for now\n \n\n   \n  Up until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,000 ahead of Trump’s reelection in November before surging about 83% — amid bouts of volatility — to its record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin  surpassed $100,000  for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned in to optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. The  GENIUS Act  was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation for  stablecoins , another kind of crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12.5% this year. Gold prices are up 54%.\n \n\n   \n  While tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia ( NVDA ) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $93,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in while there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “How the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,” Rafique at OKX said.\n \n\n   \n  Some crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,” said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. “But in our view it’s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/poland-train-track-ukraine-aid-sabotage-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"14:11:00Z","title":"Poland blames Russia after rail track used to transport aid to Ukraine is destroyed by ‘act of sabotage’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Poland has accused Russia of orchestrating a sabotage attack on a key rail line between Warsaw and Lublin, used to transport humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Reck, and Char Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:11 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Polish officials have pointed the finger at Russia after a key train track was destroyed in what Warsaw said was an “unprecedented act of sabotage” committed by two Ukrainian citizens who were “collaborating with Russian services.”\n \n\n   \n  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that the two perpetrators, who have since fled to Belarus, were identified by the country’s security services following “intensive work.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk said on Monday that the train track between the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lublin was destroyed after an “explosive device” blew it up.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certain that the attempt to blow up the tracks and the violation of railway infrastructure were intentional and aimed at causing a catastrophe in rail traffic,” the Polish leader said in the Sejm, Poland’s parliamentary lower house.\n \n\n   \n  “The established perpetrators are two Ukrainian citizens who have been collaborating with Russian services for some time. Their identities are known,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Tusk said earlier that the rail was “crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine” and that the attack “directly (targeted) the security of the Polish state and its civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  Destruction was also identified along the same route further down the railway line, he said on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin rejected Tusk’s claim of Russian collusion Tuesday, citing “Russophobia” as the driving force behind the accusation.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Russia is being blamed for all manifestations of hybrid warfare and outright warfare taking place in Poland … Russophobia is flourishing there.”\n \n\n   \n  Rebuffing Poland’s allegation, Peskov added, “The very fact that Ukrainian citizens are again involved in acts of sabotage and terrorism against critical infrastructure is significant. … If I were in the shoes of the Poles, the Germans or the French, I would think twice.”\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference Monday afternoon, Poland’s interior minister Marcin Kierwiński said that two separate incidents took place over the weekend – one confirmed act of sabotage, and one that was deemed “highly probable” to be sabotage. No arrests have been made so far in relation to the incidents.\n \n\n   \n  Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said that threats to Europe’s security are “real and growing.” The continent “must urgently boost capacity to protect our skies and our infrastructure,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Estonia’s Prime Minister Kristen Michal strongly condemned the damage to the train track,  writing on X  that his country stands with Poland.\n \n\n   \n  “Those behind hostile acts against (European Union) and NATO members must be exposed. Our response must be united,” Michal said.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also offered his country’s solidarity with Poland, offering support if needed.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government condemned the “sabotage” and said Russia was trying to shift the blame onto Ukraine. In a statement on Tuesday, the foreign ministry accused Russia of cynically recruiting Ukrainian passport holders to do its bidding. Several European countries including the United Kingdom and Germany have previously arrested, charged and, in some cases, convicted Ukrainian nationals for Russian-ordered attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope investigation will provide answers and we also stand ready to assist if called upon,” Sybiha said. “Could have been another hybrid attack by Russia - to test responses. If true, they need to be strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk vowed that his country “will catch the perpetrators, whoever they are,” without saying who he believed was responsible for the damage.\n \n\n   \n    String of suspected Russian attacks\n \n\n   \n  The explosion, which did not cause any injuries according to Tusk, is the latest in a string of incidents in Europe that have left the continent on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  Several European nations have reported incursions into their airspace in recent months, with most pointing the finger at Russia. The Kremlin has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the European Commission adopted stricter rules on issuing visas to Russian nationals, citing safety risks related to Russia’s war on Ukraine as the reason for doing this.\n \n\n   \n  “We now face unprecedented drone disruptions and sabotage on our soil. We have a duty to protect our citizens,” Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A research paper by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggested that Russia is carrying out a “campaign of sabotage, vandalism, espionage and covert action” to destabilize European governments.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents within this alleged campaign include the deliberate damaging of undersea cables, the targeting of telecommunications towers and arson plots,  IISS said .\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the outlet Polsat News on Sunday, Poland’s Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk said that his country has been confronted with varying acts of sabotage for some time, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n \n\n   \n  Last year, an  enormous fire  destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw. Polish authorities announced in May that this was the result of arson ordered by Russian intelligence services, though Russia had previously denied allegations of orchestrating arson and sabotage operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  While “someone must have damaged” the train track, Duszczyk said, he also warned against immediately assigning the blame to Russia, PAP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia is not so powerful that every arson, every situation of this type, is provoked by Russia. However, this cannot be ruled out or underestimated in any way,” he said, according to PAP.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Internal Security Agency is working alongside police, the prosecutor’s office and railway services to investigate the matter, Polish politician Tomasz Siemoniak  said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s National Security Committee will hold a meeting on Tuesday morning, with military commanders, heads of services and the president’s representative in attendance, Tusk said.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/uk/britain-china-spy-linkedin-mi5-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:13:00-05:00","title":"Chinese spies using LinkedIn to target British lawmakers, MI5 warns","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"MI5 has issued a warning that China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) is using LinkedIn and headhunters to target British lawmakers, aiming to collect sensitive political information and gain strategic advantage.

\n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:13 PM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s domestic spy service, MI5, warned lawmakers on Tuesday that China’s intelligence services are posing as recruiters to target people who work in Parliament, just weeks after the collapse of a case against two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  In an alert, MI5 said that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) was using websites like LinkedIn to build relationships with parliamentarians, in an effort to “collect sensitive information on the UK to gain strategic advantage.”\n \n\n   \n  Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, circulated the MI5 alert to Members of Parliament (MPs) and warned that Chinese state actors were “relentless” in their efforts to “interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament.” He listed two headhunters known to use LinkedIn profiles to “conduct outreach at scale” on behalf of Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me speak plainly: this activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it,” Security Minister Dan Jarvis told Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese embassy in London dismissed the claims as “pure fabrication and malicious slander.” It said it had urged Britain to “stop this self-staged charade of false accusations,” which it said was undermining relations between the countries.\n \n\n   \n  MI5’s warning comes after prosecutors last month abruptly abandoned a case against two British men  charged  with spying on MPs for Beijing, claiming that the government’s evidence was missing a “critical element” which meant there was “no other option” but to collapse the case.\n \n\n   \n  That “critical element,” prosecutors claimed, was the government’s refusal to call China an “enemy” or “national security threat.” Because the two men – Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, an academic – were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911, they could only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy. Because the British government had not labeled China an “enemy,” prosecutors said they had to drop the case.\n \n\n   \n  Downing Street said no minister, member of the government or special adviser was involved. Instead, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blamed the previous Conservative government, which was in power at the time of the alleged offenses, for wording its policies “very carefully” so as not to describe China as an enemy.\n \n\n   \n  Still, in the wake of the collapse of the case, Starmer was accused of prioritizing the relationship with Beijing over threats to Britain’s national security. The episode raised questions about Britain’s ability to balance the need to defend itself from espionage and interference while remaining economically engaged with the world’s second-largest economy. The Chinese embassy rejected the “baseless” allegations.\n \n\n   \n  After the collapse, MI5 chief Ken McCallum said Chinese spies posed a daily national security threat to Britain. “When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,” he said in his annual threat update in October.\n \n\n   \n  Without referencing the collapse of the spy case, McCallum said that the National Security Act of 2023 had addressed “longstanding weaknesses” in British legislation and “strengthened our hand against state-backed threats.”\n \n\n   \n  Jarvis, the security minister, said the latest attempts to use headhunters to spy on MPs “builds on a pattern” of hostile activity in recent years. He cited how Beijing-linked actors targeted parliamentarians’ emails in 2021 and “attempted foreign interference activity” in 2022 by Christine Lee, a British lawyer accused by MI5 of spying for Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  MI5’s latest warning comes weeks before the government must decide whether to approve a  huge new Chinese embassy in London . The decision was delayed in August after Beijing refused to explain why the plans contained blacked out areas, and critics have long said the planned complex would pose a security issue. China said Britain had shown a “total lack of spirit of contract” in delaying its decision.\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow security minister, called on the government to refuse permission for the embassy and said ministers should cancel planned trips to China.\n \n\n   \n  “What message does it send when, despite an attack on this House and our Parliament, ministers are happily jetting off to stride down red carpets with the government responsible?” Kearns said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/media/podcast-charts-apple-joe-rogan-mel-robbins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"There’s a new No. 1 podcast in America, Apple says","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple has updated its top 10 podcast rankings, with 'The Joe Rogan Experience' now in first place, overtaking 'The Daily' from The New York Times.

Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:59 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When the FBI director came back from Asia touting a major win for the administration’s drug crackdown last week, his victory lap was cut short by yet another development in  the Jeffrey Epstein saga. \n \n\n   \n  When Patel took the podium in the White House press briefing room Wednesday, the news of the administration’s efforts to stem fentanyl production — a major priority for the president — took a backseat to headlines about the latest dump of documents by the House Oversight Committee.\n \n\n   \n  For Patel and other FBI and Justice officials, the first 10 months in office have featured a series of headaches, with theories once peddled by the president’s loyal supporters-turned-government officials getting in the way of their new priorities.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI declined to comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n    The Epstein files\n \n\n   \n  In a 2023 podcast interview, conservative commentator Benny Johnson asked Patel why the so-called Epstein “list” had not been released.\n \n\n   \n  “Simple, because of who’s on that list,” Patel responded, adding that Republicans should “put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.”\n \n\n   \n  While the existence of an actual list of powerful people accused of participating in Epstein’s sex ring has never been verified — the Justice Department does hold records related to the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  In the early weeks of the current administration, Attorney General Pam Bondi orchestrated a White House event ostensibly to fulfill President Donald Trump’s transparency promises and to release the Epstein files. But the event backfired when MAGA influencers invited to the White House realized the binders Bondi presented were filled mostly with documents that had long been public.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, Bondi, Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, and other Trump administration officials have sought to close the books on Epstein — only to be confronted by the reality that the conspiracies they fueled won’t allow them to. Justice Department and FBI officials have grown frustrated that the Epstein debacle has continued to obscure other priorities.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the pressure has come from influential conservatives on social media and pro-Trump members of Congress. Trump appeared to cave to that pressure late Sunday when, after days of lashing out at Democrats who he blames for the Epstein scandal, he reversed course and told Republicans to vote for the  release of the Epstein files. \n \n\n   \n  The latest twists in the administration’s Epstein problem came after Congressional democrats  released emails   from Epstein, the convicted sex abuser. The release reignited the Justice Department’s battle to tamp down claims that powerful people were trying to keep damaging information about those in Epstein’s inner circle from being released.\n \n\n   \n  The emails, which were provided under subpoena to Congress by the Epstein estate, showed that Epstein mentioned Trump by name multiple times in his private correspondence. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the White House cast the issue as a “hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  After a day of scrutiny, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  said on X  of the emails that law enforcement “didn’t have” those emails previously and said the estate “hid” them for years. Bongino, who has also pushed unproven Epstein theories before joining the bureau, reposted it on his personal account.\n \n\n   \n  The claim prompted an attorney for the Epstein estate to dispute that anything had been “hidden” from investigators. The back-and-forth made clear that the trove of documents in the Justice Department’s possession didn’t include records now being sent to Congress, a problem for Blanche and Justice officials who have sought to assure the public that they had reviewed everything and decided there was no additional evidence of wrongdoing to be investigated.\n \n\n   \n  Justice officials’ monthslong effort to move on from the Epstein debacle had been wiped out, and Trump publicly called on Bondi to  investigate Epstein’s ties  to high-profile Democratic figures.\n \n\n   \n  That investigation is now underway,  Bondi has said , months after DOJ and FBI officials concluded that there were  no additional prosecutions  that could be brought based on their comprehensive review of the Epstein investigation.\n \n\n   \n  As director, Patel has told Congress the FBI went through all investigative materials related to Epstein and found no evidence of a grand conspiracy of Epstein trafficking women to the wealthy and elite despite his previous support of the idea.\n \n\n   \n  Patel wasn’t alone in fanning the Epstein flames. Bongino, on his own  podcast,  lamented in May 2024: “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?”\n \n\n   \n  “What do Clinton, Obama officials, big money leftists, a former prime minister of Israel — why do they want to make this Jeffrey Epstein story go away so bad?” Bongino asked.\n \n\n   \n  The contrast is sharp between then and more recent times.\n \n\n   \n  Bongino told Fox News host Sean Hannity in June his views had evolved and acknowledged being frustrated at the backlash from right-wing media.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not paid for my opinions anymore,” he said. “I work for the taxpayer. I’m paid [based] on evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  That same month, Patel told podcaster Joe Rogan about the Epstein files “We’re not gonna re-victimize women. We’re not going to put that shit back out there. It’s not happening, because he wins … You want to hate me for it, fine.”\n \n\n   \n    Pipe bomber identity \n \n\n   \n  The Epstein case, while consuming the most oxygen online and in the media, is not the only conspiracy-laden storyline that has been resurrected to the annoyance of Justice Department officials.\n \n\n   \n  For years, some figures in right-wing media have fixated on theories that the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol was an “inside job.” One of the biggest mysteries of that day remains who planted crude bombs near the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee offices. The devices were discovered around the time of the riot and, for a time, diverted police away from what was unfolding at the Capitol, fueling additional suspicions of possible coordination.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents have followed thousands of leads in their pursuit of the would-be bomber, who was clad in a hoodie and facemask, but they have so far come up  empty handed .\n \n\n   \n  Weeks before he took his post as second-in-command of the agency,  Bongino suggested  that evidence was being buried because the FBI was somehow involved. “Folks, this guy was an insider,” he said on his podcast. “This was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.”\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, The Blaze, a right-wing media outlet, published an article that named a former Capitol Police officer as the suspect based on video analysis comparing the way the officer walked to the stride of the alleged bomber.\n \n\n   \n  Soon, the FBI and Bongino himself were forced to defend the agency from the same type of allegations the deputy director had once made – including one post from Republican Rep. Thomas Massie that seemed to draw particular ire from Bongino.\n \n\n   \n  Massie  posted a letter  from a self-proclaimed FBI whistleblower that alleged FBI leadership was trying to bury information on the pipe bomber’s identity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is disgusting, even by the low standards many have for politicians,” Bongino said in a  lengthy X post  addressed to Massie. “You know my number, and you’re free to call me anytime. But it’s easier to tweet and throw BS bombs.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “a week of near 24-hour work on RECENT open-source leads in the case has yet to produce a breakthrough, and some of the media reporting regarding prior persons of interest is grossly inaccurate and serves only to mislead the public.”\n \n\n   \n  Former FBI agents and officials who once supported Patel and Bongino and welcomed the ushering of a new age at the agency have now turned their backs on the pair, including over the pipe bomb investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “You can actually hear the shovel hitting the bullshit, right? Is it just me?” former FBI agent and right-wing podcast host Kyle Seraphin posted on X Sunday following Patel’s claims on Fox News that the FBI was thoroughly investigating the pipe bombs.\n \n\n   \n    FBI Rapid Response\n \n\n   \n  As officials try to dodge conspiratorial distractions from some of their own erstwhile supporters, the FBI created a new social media account on Wednesday called the “FBI Rapid Response.”\n \n\n   \n  The stated goal of the account: Combating “lies, smears and falsehoods from the fake news and others seeking to undermine our work and national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI began working to establish the account months before the recent Epstein backlash, though it took some time to get the proper legal approvals through the government bureaucracy, a person briefed on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The account’s second post defended the FBI against claims it had lied, this time from right-wing media star Tucker Carlson, who claimed the FBI had lied about Donald Trump’s would-be assassins’ online presence.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024, Thomas Crooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, injuring Trump’s ear, killing one rally-goer and injuring others.\n \n\n   \n  “This FBI has never said Thomas Crooks had no online footprint. Ever,” the FBI  posted  about the man who shot Trump at a rally last summer and killed an attendee.\n \n\n   \n  The director himself sent out a lengthy post on social media touting the extensive investigation the FBI conducted on Crooks, defending the agency seemingly against Carlson’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  “The investigation, conducted by over 480 FBI employees, revealed Crooks had limited online and in person interactions, planned and conducted the attack alone, and did not leak or share his intent to engage in the attack with anyone,” Patel wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Bongino, in an interview alongside Patel, told Fox News in May that there was no “big, explosive ‘there’ there.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it was there, we would have told you,” Bongino said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Deep state’ mockery\n \n\n   \n  Patel, who, during Joe Biden’s presidency, published books and made scores of podcast and media appearances lamenting the “deep state” of the government and FBI now praises the work of the agency, saying he has allowed “good cops to be cops.”\n \n\n   \n  This consistent praise, however, has not stopped internal mockery of the director who, in his nine months on the job, has overseen a spate of firings in the agency against perceived political enemies. One of those fired included former acting director of the FBI, Brian Driscoll, who shielded agents that worked on January 6 cases from political retribution by the Trump administration earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, FBI agents have been sharing with each other an  AI generated music video  that pokes fun at Patel for “hiding all the Epstein files,” among other public missteps by the director, sources inside the agency told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Some FBI employees have been taken back by Patel’s use of an FBI aircraft to fly to sporting events and to visit his girlfriend, according to sources. A spokesperson for Patel said he has complied with the law requiring him to pay the cost of a regular plane ticket for his flights.\n \n\n   \n  In the video, the music plays as a computer-generated Patel dressed in a leather jumpsuit dances under colorful lights in an FBI office. He also flies on the bureau’s private jet with his girlfriend, shoves heaps of caviar into his mouth and punches a hole in a school locker.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t be mad at how I downsize, had to snuff out some liberal spies. Now my caviar is always supplied and all my people pray that I’m fired,” the song goes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/saudi-visit-ronaldo-trump-white-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-05:00","title":"Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo to visit White House, coinciding with Saudi prince’s visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is set to visit the White House on November 18, 2025, to meet with President Donald Trump, coinciding with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit.

Tuesday — the same day Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  visits for a full day of events with the president , two White House officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo, who plays in the Saudi Pro League, has scored 143 international goals for Portugal and is the first male player to score at five World Cups. Earlier this year, he became the  sport’s first billionaire player  following a contract he signed with Al Nassr, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo’s trip to the White House comes as Trump plans to welcome the Saudi prince with all the trappings of a state visit, including a welcome ceremony and formal dinner.\n \n\n   \n  The visit cannot be classified as an official state visit, however, as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. It will include a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and lunch.\n \n\n   \n  This is the crown prince’s first trip to the White House in more than seven years and the first since the 2018 murder of dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate  in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement.\n \n\n   \n  The occasion also appears to be a rare visit to the US for Ronaldo. He last played in the US in  August 2014 , when he played for European giant Real Madrid against another of his former clubs, Manchester United, on a summer preseason tour in Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo has previously faced  legal troubles  in the US over allegations that he raped a woman in Las Vegas in 2009. Ronaldo has always vehemently denied the allegations and said the encounter was consensual. Charges were never brought by local authorities, and a civil case against the Portuguese star was dismissed in 2022 due to “misconduct” by the plaintiff’s attorney. Since then, Ronaldo has appeared to make no public appearances in the US.\n \n\n   \n    2026 World Cup to be Ronaldo’s last\n \n\n   \n  Ronaldo recently told CNN that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will “definitely” be his last.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be 41 years old, and I think (this) will be the moment in the big competition,” the five-time UEFA Champions League winner told  CNN’s Becky Anderson in an interview  at the Tourise Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last week.\n \n\n   \n  The superstar also confessed to CNN that he will likely hang up his cleats on his legendary career soon: “Let’s be honest, when I mean soon, it’s probably one or two years I’ll still be (in) the game.”\n \n\n   \n  The expanded 48-team World Cup, the largest in history, kicks off on June 11, 2026, and is being co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The  World Cup draw  is scheduled for December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Trump has regularly touted bringing the World Cup to the US, including during an event  in the Oval Office  on Monday with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Patrick Sung Cuadrado contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-arson-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:50:00-04:00","title":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launched an arson attack in Beit Lid, east of Tulkarm, in the occupied West Bank on November 18, 2025, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory.

AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian economy ministry on Wednesday called on the international community to take action to stop the attacks. In Tuesday’s incident, perpetrators set fire to four trucks loaded with products from Al-Juneidi, and smashed windows and other property, it said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Anarchist fringe youth’\n \n\n   \n  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) condemned the violence. “The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious,” Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth said in a statement shared by the IDF on Wednesday. “It must be dealt with firmly.”\n \n\n   \n  He continued it was unacceptable for “lawbreakers” to “harm property and innocent civilians” while diverting the IDF’s focus “away from its mission of security and counterterrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/kessler-twins-die-assisted-suicide-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:57:00+00:00","title":"Entertainment duo the Kessler twins die by assisted suicide, aged 89","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Kessler twins, Alice and Ellen, a famous German entertainment duo from the 1950s known for their showgirl image and international performances including a Eurovision appearance and appearances on 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' died at age 89 by joint assisted suicide in Gruenwald, near Munich.

assisted suicide, aged 89 \n       \n  By Issy Ronald, Stephanie Halasz, Sharon Braithwaite, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:57 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alice and Ellen Kessler, the German  twins  who rose to fame in the 1950s as a variety entertainment duo, have died at the age of 89 by joint assisted suicide, advocacy organization the German Society for Humane Dying (DGHS)   said on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Local police confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that “there was a deployment yesterday lunchtime in Gruenwald” – the leafy suburb of Munich where the twins lived – but did not say the reason for that deployment.\n \n\n   \n  The twins contacted the DGHS, which provides access to lawyers and doctors, more than a year ago and became members, the organization told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The decisive factor is likely to have been the desire to die together on a specific date,” DGHS spokesperson Wega Wetzel told CNN, adding that she wasn’t aware of the precise reasons given by each woman.\n \n\n   \n  “Their desire to die was well-considered, long-standing, and free from any psychiatric crisis,” Wetzel said.\n \n\n   \n  During an  interview  with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera last year, the twins said they wanted “to go away together on the same day.” “The idea that one of us might get it first is very hard to bear,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  They wished to have their ashes interred in the same urn too, alongside their mother Elsa and dog Yello, Ellen Kessler told German tabloid Bild last year.\n \n\n   \n  Assisted dying, under certain circumstances, is legal in Germany after the country’s top court ruled in 2020 that an individual has the right to end their life and to seek help from a third party if they aren’t subject to external influences.\n \n\n   \n  With their blonde, coiffed hair, long legs and talent for both singing and dancing, the Kessler twins embodied the aesthetic of the 1950s and 60s showgirl.\n \n\n   \n  As children, they attended classical ballet school before fleeing East Germany in 1952 to pursue dance. Shortly after, the twins began their careers at the Lido in Paris, a venue known for its cabaret performances, but they quickly transcended that world.\n \n\n   \n  They represented Germany at the 1959 Eurovision Song Contest, appeared several times on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” once featured on the cover of Life magazine, and moved in circles populated by the biggest stars of that era like Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Rock Hudson.\n \n\n   \n  “The Ed Sullivan Show” posted a  tribute  to the Kessler twins on social media, remembering them as “dazzling stars, true legends, and sisters whose grace, charm, and magic will shine forever.”\n \n\n   \n    Fame in Italy\n \n\n   \n  The sisters soon became stars in Italy too. They made history as the first showgirls to appear on Italian television and the first female stars to show their legs on screen, according to Eurovision. However, they had to wear opaque tights due to the strict Christian conservative values of the time, state broadcaster RAI said. Nevertheless, their legs were dubbed “the legs of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  And when they posed naked for the Italian edition of Playboy in 1976, it sold out in three hours, according to Eurovision’s website.\n \n\n   \n  They appeared in Italian movies and in theater, achieving such widespread fame there that state broadcaster RAI released a detailed plan on Tuesday of the ways in which it would cover their deaths, both on the news and by rerunning old television shows starring them.\n \n\n   \n  The sisters’ entertainment careers continued long after the era of the showgirl had waned. As well as making guest appearances on German television, they starred in a musical that played in Berlin, Munich and Vienna from 2015 to 2016.\n \n\n   \n  Their lives were intertwined beyond just their shared career. They lived in “two mirrored, connecting apartments,” the sisters told Corriere della Sera last year, and would meet every day at noon for lunch.\n \n\n   \n  The twins were born in a village that today belongs to Grimma, a town in Saxony.\n \n\n   \n  Tino Kießig, the mayor of Grimma, said in a statement Monday that the town “mourns the loss of these two world-renowned personalities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/aca-subsidies-trump-obamacare-gop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:14:00-05:00","title":"Republicans are racing to find a plan for enhanced ACA subsidies.

Here’s what they’re considering \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:14 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With less than six weeks before a key set of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies expire, congressional Republicans are  scrambling  to come up with a plan to address the pain of health care premiums skyrocketing for roughly 22 million Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Health care has long been a thorny issue for Republicans, and this time is no different. The caucus is divided, with some more moderate — and vulnerable — GOP lawmakers looking to temporarily extend the enhanced Obamacare subsidies with several changes. But others are following  President Donald Trump’s push  to send federal assistance directly to consumers, rather than health insurers.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure is the looming mid-December vote in the Senate on extending the enhanced subsidies, which was a concession the several Democrats wrangled from GOP leaders in exchange for agreeing to end the record-long  federal government shutdown . However, it’s questionable if any plan — from either party — can win enough support to pass, and it’s not feasible to enact more substantive changes to the ACA subsidy structure before 2026 coverage begins.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, the  enhanced premium subsidies  made Obamacare policies more affordable — particularly for low-income consumers, who could find plans with $0 or near $0 monthly charges, and for the middle class, who became eligible for assistance for the first time. The beefed-up subsidies helped draw a  record 24 million people  to sign up for coverage this year, double the number that enrolled in 2020. And more than 90% of them receive premium assistance.\n \n\n   \n  If the enhanced subsidies lapse as scheduled, premiums are expected to soar 114%, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. A 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could have to pay $20,000 more annually for coverage. Roughly 2 million fewer people will be insured next year if the more generous assistance lapses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the enhanced subsidies would cost about $350 billion over the next decade\n \n\n   \n    Giving money to consumers\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump pushed the idea of sending subsidies directly to consumers, rather than to insurers, as is now the case in the Affordable Care Act. The president doubled down on the effort on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE.”\n \n\n   \n  At least two senators have jumped on Trump’s declaration, sketching out different ways of shifting federal funds to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Giving Americans more control over their health care spending is a longtime goal of many Republicans, said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+ and former health policy director for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. GOP lawmakers have long advocated for greater use of health savings accounts, or HSAs, which allow people to sock away money that can be used to pay for medical expenses tax free — though the funds typically can’t be used to pay for health insurance premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida is working on a bill that will give Americans funds “in HSA-style accounts and let them buy the health care they want. This will increase competition & drive down costs,” he  posted on X  in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Scott has not provided many details on his legislation but  told Fox News  on Sunday that people could use the funds to pay for premiums or co-pays. His proposal doesn’t seek to repeal Obamacare, but to fix it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, ideas like Trump’s and Scott’s could rock the Affordable Care Act and, potentially, lead to its withering or demise, experts say. That’s because people with fewer health care needs would likely use the funds to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage, leaving sicker, costlier enrollees in Obamacare policies and prompting insurers to raise premiums.\n \n\n   \n  “This would in a big way pull healthy people out of the ACA risk pool and likely lead to a premium death spiral and collapse of the ACA marketplaces,” said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy.\n \n\n   \n  An alternate plan promoted by GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana would direct the funds that would have been spent on the enhanced subsidies into flexible spending accounts that policyholders could use to shop for health care, which he argues would give patients incentives to find better prices. Cassidy is also open to the use of HSAs since the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill broadened eligibility to more ACA enrollees, a spokesman for the senator told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We empower patients to shop to find the best deal for their dollar that drives competition and that lowers cost,” Cassidy said in a speech on the Senate floor last week.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy, who said on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that he is in communication with the White House about his plan, would retain the original Affordable Care Act subsidies, which were part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring.\n \n\n   \n  However, the complex US health care system is not designed for patients to shop for services, despite attempts by the first Trump administration to increase price transparency, experts said. It can be difficult for insured patients to know how much they would be responsible for when taking into account negotiated rates, deductibles and co-insurance. Plus, most spending is driven by sick patients who already have relationships with providers, and consolidation in the industry has decreased competition.\n \n\n   \n  “In theory, it seems like a good idea,” said Mona Shah, senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, which advocates for equitable health care. “The reality is even if that [price] information is accessible, how many people could navigate that, understand the differences, have the time to do that and then make informed decisions?”\n \n\n   \n  Also, giving consumers more control over the funds could actually put upward pressure on health care prices since they’ll have more money to spend on services, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n \n\n   \n    Extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, there are efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the enhanced subsidies, which are formally known as premium tax credits, though some GOP lawmakers are advocating changes to the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  A bipartisan group of 30 House members  wrote a letter  Monday to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, urging them to include House lawmakers in the health reform discussions. Among the authors was Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Republican, who wants to extend the enhanced subsidies for a year to give Congress time to come up with an alternate plan.\n \n\n   \n  “As you know, those who rely on the expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) are facing drastic premium increases,” the representatives wrote. “Allowing these tax credits to lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”\n \n\n   \n  Another bipartisan House proposal calls for extending the enhanced subsidies for two years but placing an income cap on beefed-up assistance, phasing it out for those who make between $200,000 and $400,000 annually.\n \n\n   \n  Neither party wants “to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these [enhanced subsidies] expire with nothing in its place,” GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus who supports the effort, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday. “It can’t just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/maga-movement-trump-epstein-division","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:27:00-05:00","title":"The key issues that are suddenly dividing MAGA","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a growing internal division within the MAGA coalition as Donald Trump's political influence wanes.

18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of  President Donald Trump’s  great talents as a politician has been in holding together a very disparate coalition. His supporters might not have agreed on everything, but they did agree on Trump. And that’s what mattered.\n \n\n   \n  But as the party begins to turn to its post-Trump realities — and as the great MAGA unifying force that is Trump appears politically diminished — those divisions are starting to come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, with the president soon becoming a lame duck who can’t run again, there seems to be a rush to define what a post-Trump GOP will look like.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking was  Trump’s capitulation  over the weekend on releasing the Epstein files. But that’s not the only issue on which the president’s coalition appears to be dividing and many in Trump’s base appear to be on a different page.\n \n\n   \n  These tensions have existed for a while. But what seems to be shifting is that they’re now breaking out in the open.\n \n\n   \n  Below is a look at some of the big issues where we’re seeing this.\n \n\n   \n    The Epstein files\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s problems here appear to be more of a slow burn of MAGA disillusionment, rather than a harsh backlash.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have routinely showed less than a majority of Republicans approve of Trump’s and his administration’s handling of the matter. In a late-September  NPR-PBS News-Marist College poll , the number was just 45% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean a majority  disapprove ; only around one-quarter do, while the rest withhold judgment. But it’s pretty stunning to see Trump get less than majority support from his own party on any issue. Indeed, even after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a  majority of Republicans stood by Trump’s handling of  the response to it.\n \n\n   \n  Majorities of Republicans have also said they believe the government has hidden information about Epstein’s death and alleged clients and that powerful people are implicated in his crimes. Given that, it stands to reason that they wouldn’t like Trump standing in the way of full transparency. The president indicated on Monday he’d sign legislation to release the Justice Department files if it reaches his desk.\n \n\n   \n    Tucker Carlson/Nick Fuentes/antisemitism/Charlie Kirk conspiracy theories\n \n\n   \n  All of these elements are interwoven. They basically boil down to internal MAGA divisions over whether to police other elements of the movement – including when they promote racist and antisemitic views.\n \n\n   \n  GOP leaders and many prominent influencers have been reluctant to do that for fear of alienating would-be supporters and taking the focus off the left.  Vice President JD Vance  and Megyn Kelly were early proponents of a “no enemies on the right” posture.\n \n\n   \n  But some, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have since argued that antisemitism has so infected the conservative movement  that it’s dangerous to ignore it . There’s also growing alarm over Candace Owens  baselessly connecting  Israel to Charlie Kirk’s assassination on her immensely popular podcast. The theory appears to have gained real traction amid some corners on the right.\n \n\n   \n  Passionate and sometimes angry debates have ensued. This most recently  blew up over the Heritage Foundation’s  initial decision to stand by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson after his friendly interview with Nick Fuentes, a White nationalist and Holocaust denier. Prominent people continue to leave the organization.\n \n\n   \n    Tariffs and affordability\n \n\n   \n  This is another one of those slow-burn problems for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The MAGA base has been  willing to entertain Trump’s tariffs  and even willing to believe they’ll eventually turn out to be for the best — despite them running contrary to decades of GOP free-trade evangelism. But there are also signs of declining patience.\n \n\n   \n  A recent  Washington Post-ABC News poll  showed 25% of Republicans disapproved of Trump’s handling of tariffs, and nearly half (47%) said the tariffs would make inflation worse.\n \n\n   \n  Other recent polls have shown a majority of Republicans say the Trump administration  isn’t focusing enough on lowering prices , and just 65% say Trump’s policies have improved economic conditions in the country, according to  a recent CNN poll .\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs and prices at home were some of the first issues on which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia  broke with Trump .\n \n\n   \n    H1-B visas\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent interview with Laura Ingraham was unusually contentious for a Fox News interview.\n \n\n   \n  While talking about the  H1-B skilled worker visa program , Ingraham posited that the US didn’t need to import so many workers because “we have plenty of talented people here.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump replied rather brusquely: “ No, you don’t, no you don’t  … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn.”\n \n\n   \n  The answer rekindled  an old MAGA backlash , which first reared its head when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the need for H1-B visas after the 2024 election. A number of MAGA influencers  publicly criticized Trump  last week. Actor Kevin Sorbo declared that the answer would “cost republicans the midterms.”\n \n\n   \n  A Quinnipiac University poll in January showed  28% of Republicans opposed the H1-B program  outright.\n \n\n   \n    The ballroom/self-enrichment issues\n \n\n   \n  Trump has taken remarkably little care to guard against the perception that he’s bathing in luxury even as Americans are struggling. He’s also taken remarkably little care to guard against  apparent conflicts of interest  and intermingling of personal business with his presidential duties.\n \n\n   \n  And there are signs that it’s wearing even on some of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most striking was Trump’s decision last month to bulldoze the East Wing of the White House and start building a $350 million ballroom during the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A poll showed only a slight majority of Republicans approved of the project, and  about one-quarter disapproved .\n \n\n   \n  Relatedly, Trump’s personal businesses have pressed forward with lucrative development and cryptocurrency deals that often overlap with his official business. Most recently, the Trump Organization this week announced  a project in the Maldives  with its Saudi-linked development partners, on the eve of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has said it extensively studies any potential conflicts of interest. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in May that it was “frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit.”\n \n\n   \n  A recent  Pew Research Center poll  showed about 3 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agreed that Trump was probably improperly using his office to enrich himself or his friends and family.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s foreign focus\n \n\n   \n  Steve Bannon recently flagged an emerging MAGA sentiment that Trump might be too focused on foreign matters — as opposed to “America First.”\n \n\n   \n  Or, as Bannon put it  to Axios , Trump is spending “too much time on Palestine and not enough on East Palestine,” Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Trump is throwing  a lavish welcome  for the Saudi crown prince. Last week he hosted the Syrian president. Perhaps most striking was the  tens of billions of dollars  Trump recently pledged to help Argentina and  prop up a political ally  in its president, Javier Milei. We don’t have good polling on that, but it’s logical to assume that such a foreign bailout might be a problem with some in the “America First” crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Many Republicans are skeptical of Trump’s  threats to attack Venezuela  and other recent maneuvers in South America. A recent  Reuters-Ipsos poll  showed 39% of Republicans supported using military force to remove Nicolas Maduro, while 29% opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  Another  27% opposed  Trump using the military to kill suspected drug-traffickers without due process, as he has with his boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, the GOP base seemed  somewhat skeptical  of Trump’s strikes on Iran in June, with just 44% “strongly” supporting them in a CNN poll. And even the ceasefire the president  brokered in Gaza hasn’t done much for Trump’s numbers.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed 52% of Republicans said it was “better for the nation if the US stays out of the affairs of other nations.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/lawsuit-air-ambulance-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"Lawsuit Filed Over 2 Deaths in January Air Ambulance Crash in Philadelphia","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The families of two Mexican citizens, Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo and Lizeth Murillo Osuna, filed a wrongful death lawsuit after an air ambulance operated by Med Jets, S.A. de C.V.

Sunday after Thanksgiving, data shows \n       \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Flight delays and the recent government shutdown are pushing more travelers onto US highways this Thanksgiving, raising the risk of wrecks on what is already one of the most dangerous travel periods of the year, data shows.\n \n\n   \n  The crash rate on the Sunday after Thanksgiving is 65% higher compared with the previous Sunday, based on 2024 data analyzed by Samsara, a technology company that tracks commercial fleet safety.\n \n\n   \n  Kelly Soderlund, head of insights at Samsara told CNN, this year could be even more dangerous because of the surge in drivers.\n \n\n   \n   The American Automobile Association  projects nearly 82 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home over the holiday period, which runs from Tuesday, November 25, through Monday, December 1.\n \n\n   \n  That is an increase of about 1.6 million from last year. The association said the number could rise further if travelers switch from flying to driving after recent flight cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people needed to make their plans during a time when the government was shut down and air travel was having a rough go,” Soderlund said. “We knew there was going to be more people on the road.”\n \n\n   \n    Why the Sunday after Thanksgiving is especially risky\n \n\n   \n  In its study “America’s Most Dangerous Winter Roads,” released Tuesday, Samsara analyzed data from 2022 through 2025. The results show a consistent pattern: crash risk rises in winter regardless of fleet size or industry.\n \n\n   \n  Thanksgiving itself is usually safer, Soderlund said, because many people are off the road visiting family. The higher crash risk comes during transitional travel periods, especially the Sunday after the holiday. This year it falls on November 30.\n \n\n   \n  Samsara found the spike is driven by heavy congestion, long-distance travel and driver fatigue. Millions of Americans are returning home, creating one of the busiest travel windows of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only regular consumers heading back on the road but also delivery drivers and commercial trucks,” Soderlund said. During Thanksgiving week, many shippers scale back operations, reducing the number of trucks on the road. But the Sunday after, fleets ramp up again, coinciding with the busiest travel day of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Winter conditions also increase risk. Early winter weather, including rain and snow, is already appearing in several regions. “If it’s not winter yet, you may be getting rain or early snow, which can make roads slick and reduce visibility,” Soderlund said.\n \n\n   \n  Certain roads and regions carry higher risks, including I-80 across the country, the New Jersey Turnpike and northern states such as North Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Iowa, where snow and icy conditions can appear early.\n \n\n   \n    Tips for staying safe\n \n\n   \n  Drivers can reduce risk by leaving earlier in the day, avoiding night travel and keeping extra space around large trucks.\n \n\n   \n  About half of all winter crashes occur between noon and 8 p.m., when visibility drops and fatigue peaks, Soderlund said. Afternoon and evening travel can also be dangerous because of congestion and delivery traffic.\n \n\n   \n  “Be aware of blind spots,” Soderlund said. “Don’t assume commercial vehicles can see you and give them plenty of room. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:35:00-05:00","title":"A new virus variant and lagging vaccinations may mean the US is in for a severe flu season","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States may face a severe flu season in 2025 due to the emergence of a mutated influenza strain called subclade K, which has been driving early surges in the UK, Canada, and Japan.

The US had  its highest rates  of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least  280 children died of influenza , the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.\n \n\n   \n    A new player\n \n\n   \n  Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the  latest FluView report  from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the   predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n \n\n   \n  UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization   for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.\n \n\n   \n  But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a  recent preprint study , which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between   August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Flu vaccinations  have also fallen  in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus   this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with  more than 443,000 cases . Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.\n \n\n   \n  “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is the time we start to see the rise’\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like   the severity is also worse,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.\n \n\n   \n  The company anonymously compiles its test results into a  syndromic surveillance tool , which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”\n \n\n   \n  Signals  are also rising  in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.\n \n\n   \n  “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/world/hong-kong-crash-preliminary-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00-05:00","title":"Engine accelerated after landing, a probe into deadly Hong Kong plane crash finds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A preliminary investigation into a deadly cargo plane crash in Hong Kong on October 20, 2025, revealed that the Boeing 747’s Number 4 engine unexpectedly accelerated after landing, with its thrust lever in full forward position and reverse thrust disengaged.

Usually, they’d play poker, sometimes bourré but almost always some sort of card game for money.\n \n\n   \n  “And by the time the plane hit the ground,’’ chuckles one former  NBA  player who still works in the league and asked not to be identified, “your per diem would be gone. God forbid it was a 10-day trip.”\n \n\n   \n  To understand how professional athletes are getting caught in the crosshairs of illegal gambling activity, it helps to understand their culture. Theirs is a world consumed by competition and hyper-competitive people who have disposable income and time on their hands.\n \n\n   \n  “It is,’’ said an NBA scout who asked not to be identified, “a perfect storm.’’\n \n\n   \n  Many fans shook their heads when details about two alleged gambling schemes broke in recent weeks. The first  resulted in the arrest  of a current NBA coach – Chauncey Billups, a Hall of Famer – and current player Terry Rozier. Billups is accused of allegedly conspiring with noted New York crime families to rig poker games and fleece unsuspecting participants out of thousands of dollars. Rozier allegedly intentionally tipped bettors off about his game participation, allowing them to profit off of prop bets that involved him.\n \n\n   \n   The second involved Cleveland Guardians  pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase. Both men are accused of allegedly working with co-conspirators to throw specific pitches in  Major League Baseball  games, coordinating with corrupt bettors to rig prop bets. The bets are alleged to have won $400,000 for bettors and Ortiz received $12,000 and Clase at least $60,000 for their roles in the scheme, according to the federal indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Why would players making hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, take part in an alleged gambling scheme that only amounted up to a fraction of their salary? Why take that risk?\n \n\n   \n  “The game fixing, the integrity of the game, that part makes no sense to me. None of it does,’’ one scout tells  CNN Sports . “And Chauncey Billups, he’s got millions. But I guess maybe he needs the action? That’s the thing. It’s kind of who they are, and now there are just so many outlets.’’\n \n\n   \n  Athletes’ hard wiring – their need to win at everything – is what makes them better than the rest of us mere mortals. Yet that same compulsion to compete, that adrenaline rush, is also what makes gambling so alluring.\n \n\n   \n  Rutgers University’s Center for Gambling Studies recently cross referenced 56 studies done on gambling and discovered that 78.9% of those studies concluded athletes gambled at higher rates than non athletes and 75% found that athletes were more likely to gamble than their non-athletic peers.\n \n\n   \n  “I can stop gambling,’’  Michael Jordan  told Connie Chung in a 1993 interview, when his own casino escapades came under scrutiny. “I have a competition problem, a competitive problem.’’\n \n\n   \n  This is not to say that all – or even most – athletes slip into the shady underworld uncovered in recent federal indictments or worse, shave points or fix games. Nor is it to excuse the behavior of those who have been accused.\n \n\n   \n  But for those who can’t comprehend how such a thing could occur, it helps to see just where the slippery slope might start.\n \n\n   \n  “These guys, they’re not going to sit around and read a f**king book,’’ the former scout said. “The game fixing? That surprises me, but the poker stuff? Not at all. You’re at a pre-game shootaround and someone says, ‘$100 I can make this shot.’ And they start at halfcourt, or three-quarters court. And they all get in.’’\n \n\n   \n    Cards and culture\n \n\n   \n  Card games have long been the pastime of the people who play America’s pastimes. Tony Kubek once told the Record of New Jersey about the 36-hour train rides he took with the New York Yankees in his MLB rookie season.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about poker games – $100 bills on the table and this was in an era when the good players were making $25,000,” he told the paper.\n \n\n   \n  Kubek made his debut in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  More than 20 years ago, long-time friends Charles Oakley and Tyrone Hill got into a beef over a gambling debt owed by Hill to Oakley, reportedly in the tens of thousands of dollars. Frustrated that he hadn’t been paid, Oakley, then with the Raptors, leveled a ball at Hill’s head during a pre-game shootaround between Toronto and the Philadelphia 76ers. Oakley got slapped with a $10,000 fine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hey you borrow money from the bank, they charge taxes,’’ Oakley later told  GQ   about the incident. “You don’t pay the IRS, they come and get you. So I had to come get him.’’\n \n\n   \n  Oakley and Hill’s spat went public; the bad blood stemming from the seemingly innocuous games was not, however, limited to just that pair. More than a few coaches, in fact, grew tired of the infighting and stopped the games – or the ones they knew about.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t really see them so much anymore,’’ a former NBA executive told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They drop $20,000 and think nothing of it’\n \n\n   \n  But it is impossible to stop gambling. It is, for starters, legal for people older than 21 and permissible in every state save Utah and Hawaii. Sports gambling is permissible now in 38 states. All four major professional sports – the NHL,  NFL , MLB and NBA – have strict rules on betting on their own sports but only the NFL prohibits players from gambling while on the road in team hotels and from entering a sportsbook during the season. League rules also stipulate that coaches, staff and personnel cannot bet on any sports.\n \n\n   \n  And gambling is everywhere. Of the 27 cities that sponsor NBA franchises, 17 have casinos in or near their city’s downtown.\n \n\n   \n  “You ask any security guard,’’ the scout said. “Some of these guys, they go over to the casino and they drop $20,000 and think nothing of it. Because it’s not a lot to them. It’s not about the money. It’s about winning.’’\n \n\n   \n  The NBA Summer League is held in Las Vegas where it’s not unusual, the former exec says, to see players frequent the blackjack or craps tables on the Strip.\n \n\n   \n  “And we’re not talking the $10 tables,’’ he says. “We’re talking the big-money tables.’’\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the advent of online betting means no one even needs to leave their rooms.\n \n\n   \n  “Gambling, with DraftKings and FanDuel, it’s everywhere now,’’ says former Major League outfielder Jayson Werth. “It really is part of the culture.’’\n \n\n   \n    The hook of horse racing for a retired star\n \n\n   \n  A self-described “competitive junkie’’ who had to win in backyard Wiffleball games and pickup hoops, Werth felt the void of competition hit like a gut punch when he retired in 2018. Though he is quick to point out that he cannot comprehend how any professional athlete would engage in fixing games – “To try and lose? That isn’t even in the realm of possibility. You’re trying your best to win,’’ he told CNN Sports – he does understand what it’s like to feed the need to win.\n \n\n   \n  Werth tried the post-career life of leisure, signing up for pro-am  golf  tourneys. He dabbled in quirky investments, including organic racing, but nothing quite worked. He wasn’t lost but slightly unmoored.\n \n\n   \n  And then he went down to Tampa to visit a friend, Rich Averill. The two went to Tampa Downs to watch a race involving a horse that Averill owned. Standing on the rails, a very familiar adrenaline rush coursed through Werth.\n \n\n   \n  “I was hooked,’’ he said.\n \n\n   \n  He could have done it the easy way – studied the racing form and hit the windows – but Werth realized the difference was ownership. Being all in on the horse as a financial investor meant being personally invested.\n \n\n   \n  He partnered with some friends to form  Two Eight Racing  (he wore number 28 in his pro career) and set up immersing himself in the business of horse racing. He learned about bloodstocks, researched trainers and showed up regularly at the barn to meet and greet his own horses.\n \n\n   \n  He admittedly got a little lucky – his first big horse, Dornoch, won the Belmont Stakes and his second, Flying Mohawk, made last year’s Kentucky Derby field – but he realized he didn’t need to win to feel what he needed to feel.\n \n\n   \n  That led him to branch out to form Icon Racing, a horse racing syndicate that allows partial owners to experience full-time ownership. It’s open to everyone but Werth has personally tried to lure his fellow athletes.\n \n\n   \n  “I get it,’’ he said. “We need something. I played with guys who would bet you $100 if a penny was going to land on heads or tails. You’re raised to compete your whole life so that’s what you do. You compete.\n \n\n   \n  “But when it’s gone? It’s gone. I don’t think I realized how much of an itch that was until I couldn’t scratch it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/sport/football-nfl-cowboys-raiders-week-11","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00+00:00","title":"Dallas Cowboys keep playoff hopes alive with dominant win over Las Vegas Raiders","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dallas Cowboys secured a 33-16 road victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, keeping their playoff hopes alive.

with dominant win over Las Vegas Raiders \n       \n  By Patrick Sung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:48 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Dallas Cowboys  ensured they stayed in the  NFL  playoff hunt with a 33-16 road win against the Las Vegas Raiders on an emotional night for “America’s Team.”\n \n\n   \n  In Dallas’ first game since the  death of Marshawn Kneeland , the Cowboys – who wore shirts in memory of and bowed their heads during a moment of silence for the defensive end – snapped a two-game losing streak while showing the type of offensive play that could make them a dangerous matchup throughout the rest of the season.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some tears when I first put the shirt on, as you can imagine,” Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer said. “But more than anything, I know Marshawn was looking down on us, and we wanted to make him proud, and I think we did that.”\n \n\n   \n  Behind an impressive Dak Prescott – who threw 25-of-33 for 268 yards and four touchdowns – and a stout run defense that limited the Raiders to 27 yards on the ground, the Cowboys took control in the second quarter and eased to victory.\n \n\n   \n  After a relatively slow 15 minutes that featured three field goals and ended with a 6-3 Raiders lead, Dallas quickly put Las Vegas in the rear view mirror with Prescott throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to a wide open CeeDee Lamb nine seconds into the second quarter to cap off a six-play, 68-yard drive.\n \n\n   \n  Prescott had his second touchdown of the day almost 10 minutes later, this time throwing a short pass over the middle to Dallas tight end Jake Ferguson to make it 17-6 after the extra point.\n \n\n   \n  The Raiders were marching downfield looking to cut into the deficit with roughly 2:30 left in the half, but Geno Smith’s pass was tipped by Kenneth Murray Jr. and intercepted by Markquese Bell to take the wind out of Las Vegas’ sails.\n \n\n   \n  Prescott then capped off his extraordinary second quarter with his third touchdown of the night, this time to George Pickens, who caught the ball at the 25, spun away from Kyu Blu Kelly toward the sidelines and cut back to evade two more Raiders defenders and run it into the end zone.\n \n\n   \n  The flashy touchdown was the icing on the cake for a standout performance from Pickens, who finished the game with nine catches for 144 yards.\n \n\n   \n  Despite a Las Vegas field goal as the half ended tightening the scoreline to 24-9, Dallas stayed firmly in control in the second half with Prescott adding his fourth touchdown, this time a short pass to Ryan Flournoy with 6:19 left in the third.\n \n\n   \n  Smith threw a touchdown early in the final quarter to Tre Tucker, but the Raiders didn’t really trouble the Cowboys the rest of the night despite also tallying a safety with 11:39 remaining.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Schottenheimer said the players wanted a good showing for Kneeland: “They wanted to honor him, and we’re not done honoring him. He’s a part of our family forever.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s been tough, man. I mean, these past 11 days have been really tough. I’m proud of those guys because just the way they played today, they played with Marshawn’s play style.”\n \n\n   \n  Cowboys owner Jerry Jones added that the statement win served two purposes.\n \n\n   \n  “In a way, a competition like this with the Raiders is good therapy to come back and get in it. They know how much that Marshawn loved to compete, how much he loved the Cowboys,” he said. “And to me, it’s just a way of saying, ‘This one’s for you, Marshawn.’”\n \n\n   \n  With the win, the Cowboys move to 4-5-1 and second in the NFC East. While Dallas currently has a 7% chance to make the playoffs according to the NFL’s  playoff picture calculator , offensive play like Monday’s could see a strong end to the season and a chance to crash the postseason party.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/roblox-ai-age-verification-youth-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:08:00-05:00","title":"Roblox Implements AI Age Verification to Block Adults from Chatting with Minors Amid Lawsuits and Abuse Allegations","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roblox is introducing a mandatory age verification system for chat features, requiring users to either provide a government ID or submit a face photo to an AI tool from Persona for age estimation.

New AI age verification aims to block them from chatting with adults \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:08 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If Roblox users want to chat on the online gaming platform, they’ll soon have to verify their age by providing a government ID or by letting an artificial intelligence age estimation tool photograph their face.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes as the platform faces a string of lawsuits and other claims that it has enabled sexual predators to connect with and abuse children. Roblox said the updated policy will make it easier to prevent young users from connecting with adult strangers.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox is a platform where users can create and play online games and interact with each other. Unlike many other online platforms, Roblox allows users under the age of 13; the platform has long advertised itself as a fun way for children to learn how to code. It has more than 150 million users globally, one third of whom are under 13.\n \n\n   \n  But the company has come under a microscope following reports of children being groomed, abused and, in some cases, even  kidnapped  by adults they met on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys general of  Kentucky  and  Louisiana  filed separate lawsuits accusing Roblox of harming children earlier this year. Florida’s attorney general also filed a  criminal subpoena  seeking information from the company last month and calling Roblox a “breeding ground for predators.”\n \n\n   \n  Individual families have also sued the company, including  Becca Dallas , who alleges her 15-year-old son, Ethan, died by suicide after being groomed via Roblox and messaging site Discord.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox already has some policies and features in place meant to protect young users; for example, it offers parental controls, blocks the sharing of photos and personal information and uses human and AI text and voice moderation. It also requires users to verify their age in order to access certain “18+” experiences, such as games with heavy violence or crude humor. But the update announced Tuesday is expected to greatly increase the number of users verifying their age on the platform, executives said on a call with reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “Our priority is safety and civility,” said Roblox Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman. “We want to make Roblox a safe, positive, age-appropriate experience for everybody. We set extremely high standards for ourselves, and we understand that the public expects the same from us.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement coincides with a planned “virtual protest” within Roblox, planned by the nonprofit ParentsTogether Action, to call for more youth safety features on the platform, including stronger default privacy protections for users under 13.   It also comes amid a wider push by online platforms to determine users’ ages to protect young people;  YouTube  and  Meta  are among the other popular apps using AI for age estimates, although the tools vary across platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new policy, all users will be required to verify their age before accessing chat features on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If users choose not to upload an ID, they’ll have to photograph their faces so AI can estimate their age, using technology from identity verification firm Persona. The tool uses the front camera on a user’s device and prompts them to move their face in specific directions, in an effort to ensure a real person is doing the verification. The AI will place users in an estimated age range — under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20 or 21+ — and they’ll only be allowed to chat with other users in or near that range.\n \n\n   \n  A user estimated to be 12 years old, for example, would be able to chat with users ages 15 and younger but not 16 and older, according to Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If the AI places someone into the wrong age group, users over 13 can upload an ID to correct their age. Parents whose accounts are linked to their child’s via Roblox’s parental control tools can also correct their child’s age. (ID checks are available only to users older than 13, likely because online privacy regulations are more stringent for younger children.)\n \n\n   \n  Roblox says the images of users’ faces will be used only for age estimation, and they’ll be deleted after users are placed in an age bucket.\n \n\n   \n  “We see these changes as a way to help ensure users are able to socialize with others in age groups that are appropriate but also help limit contact between minors and adults that they do not know,” said Rajiv Bhatia, Roblox vice president and head of user and discovery product.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox declined to share a specific accuracy rate for its AI age estimation technology. Kaufman said it is “typically pretty accurate within one or two years” for users between 5 and 25 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Some users have found  workarounds  for other platforms’ face scan age estimation technology, such as by using images of video game characters or selfies of other people. But Kaufman said   Roblox’s technology has “fairly robust fraud checks in place” to determine whether the person is “live” and “moving around and following instructions.” He added that the system also looks for “other anomalies, like people trying to repeat use the same face over and over.”\n \n\n   \n  Roblox will roll out age verification on a voluntary basis   starting Tuesday. It will become mandatory in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands in December, and globally early next year.\n \n\n   \n   Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Roblox’s age requirements for certain content. Users must verify their age in order to access certain experiences marked “18+”. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/home-depot-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Home Depot’s business is stuck.

Alaa Elassar and Holly Yan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weeks before 8-year-old Eloise “ Lulu ” Peck was carried off by the violent Texas floods that swallowed  Camp Mystic  in a surge of darkness and debris, she had suddenly begun to fear the forces that would one day claim her.\n \n\n   \n  She filled a page in her notebook with a drawing of rising water, black skies and the kind of creeping dread that children rarely have words for.\n \n\n   \n  “(The drawings were) a quiet reflection of the worries that lingered in her gentle heart,” her parents wrote in the lawsuit they filed on her behalf. “That she left this world in the very way she feared most is a truth too heavy to bear.”\n \n\n   \n  In the pitch-black, storm-lashed hours before dawn on Independence Day, surging floodwaters ravaged Hunt and Kerr County in central Texas, including the summer camp filled with sleeping children.\n \n\n   \n  Four months’ worth of rain fell in  just hours  and the nearby Guadalupe River rose  to 30  feet, sweeping homes, cars, campers and cabins downstream.\n \n\n   \n  The catastrophic flooding killed  27 girls and counselors  at Camp Mystic.\n \n\n   \n  Lulu’s family, along with the families of 17 oth﻿er campers and two counselors, have filed  lawsuits  against the all-girls Christian camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence.\n \n\n   \n  The court filings accuse the camp of failing to move cabins out of flood-prone areas, responding poorly to the emergency, and putting profits ahead of the safety of the girls in their care.\n \n\n   \n  The four lawsuits, filed last week, are the first attempt by grieving parents to seek accountability for the flood that turned a  haven of faith and childhood friendships  into a scene of unimaginable loss.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions surrounding their deaths were marked by absolute horror, physical pain, and emotional distress, all of which were foreseeable and preventable had Defendants acted with even minimal care for their safety,” the Peck family lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits provide an account of the living nightmare that unfolded that morning on July 4 and shed light on the last moments of young girls struggling to survive. Here’s what we learned.\n \n\n   \n    Holding on for dear life\n \n\n   \n  The children taken by the current of the furious river clung to the branches of trees, according to one of the lawsuits, their bodies engulfed in foul, mud-laden water swirling with debris. They held on, blind to whatever threats drifted beneath the murky surface.\n \n\n   \n  “Some victims survived for a period of time, while trapped within the cabins, enduring prolonged physical suffering, panic, and terror as the water level rose beyond their reach,” the Peck family lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “Others were pulled into the current and swept away into the darkness. These children faced the unimaginable; a slow and terrifying awareness that they were being overcome by the flood, alone in darkness, unable to reach safety,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  As the rain poured down and lightning split the sky, counselors in two cabins near a hill made the desperate choice to flee the rapidly rising waters, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  They climbed through windows, dragging terrified girls into the deluge, running across mud-slicked ground to the top of a hill. Hours passed as they waited, soaked and shivering in the relentless rain, listening “to screams for help from other cabins that housed their friends and fellow campers,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  Five other cabins were evacuated to Rec Hall, an older, two-story structure on higher ground than the lower lying cabins, according to that lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  From their vantage point, they could see the counselors in the cabins that were told not to evacuate “flashing SOS on their flashlights, begging the Camp for help.”\n \n\n   \n  Those cabins are where little girls had been sleeping, mere steps from the swelling river.\n \n\n   \n  In the Twins cabins, girls startled awake by thunder begged Edward Eastland, a camp director and the co-owners’ son, to allow them to evacuate.\n \n\n   \n  “He told them they had to stay because the water would go back down,” the lawsuit said. But it didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The girls got on their top bunks, as the water pressed them against the cabin ceiling. Several girls decided to swim out to avoid drowning in the cabin, and others were swept out by rushing waters. Some girls never made it out of the cabin,” stated that same lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  About 30 minutes later, Eastland and several girls were washed out to a tree nearby, where they held on through the night. Some campers tried to grasp its branches, only to be torn away by the raging current; others bobbed by, unable to reach it.\n \n\n   \n  “Girls in the tree watched in horror as their friends floated by begging for help,” the lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts told CNN that despite spotty cell coverage and chaotic conditions, Eastland and his father, Richard “Dick” Eastland, were actively helping evacuate campers within 2 hours of receiving the first warning, emphasizing that the camp had moved 166 girls to safety during those critical hours.\n \n\n   \n  Dick Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to  save some of the girls , a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls’\n \n\n   \n  The trees the campers clung to had weathered floods before, but nothing like this. It was Texas’  deadliest  freshwater flooding in  more than a century .\n \n\n   \n  Long before the morning of July 4, Camp Mystic’s owners knew how powerful and dangerous the Guadalupe River was, the lawsuits allege.\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s history of flooding is long and deadly, with major inundations in 1932, 1978 and 1984, and the flooding of a nearby camp in 1987, Peck family lawsuit said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, Camp Mystic failed to build adequate warning systems, evacuation routes, or modern flood safeguards, the victims’ family lawsuits allege.\n \n\n   \n  Eastland warned for decades about the hidden dangers of the beautiful but volatile Guadalupe River, a peril he saw firsthand while running his family’s youth camp alongside its banks.\n \n\n   \n  He successfully pushed for a new flood warning system after 10 children at a nearby camp were swept to their deaths in 1987, and in recent years served on the board of the local river authority as it supported renewed efforts to improve warnings on the Guadalupe.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m sure there will be other drownings,” Eastland said in a 1990 interview with the Austin American-Statesman. “People don’t heed the warnings.”\n \n\n   \n  Eastland has been praised as a hero for his efforts to save campers and remembered as a beloved figure by generations who spent their summers in the idyllic riverside refuge. His legacy is less clear as a public steward of the sometimes deadly river that ultimately took his life.\n \n\n   \n  About a decade after it was installed, the warning system Eastland had championed in the late ‘80s had already become antiquated and broken. The river authority ultimately shut it down in 1999, saying it was “unreliable with some of the system’s stations not reporting information,” according to an article in the Kerrville Daily Times. Yet periodic attempts to adopt a more modern flood-monitoring system, including one with warning sirens that might have alerted campers last week, repeatedly failed to gain traction – stalled by low budgets, some local opposition and a lack of state support.\n \n\n   \n  But parents point out another concern.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the cabins had been located in FEMA’s 100-year “Special Flood Hazard Area” up until 2013. That’s when the camp petitioned FEMA to remove most of the cabins from floodplain maps, says the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors. The move did nothing but spare the Eastlands costly insurance premiums and expensive renovations, the filing states.\n \n\n   \n  “Since July 1932, Camp Mystic knew that cabins that housed defenseless little girls sat in the bullseye of potential flood waters from the Guadalupe River and never said a word about it to trusting parents,” the Peck family lawsuit says. “Since that date, Camp Mystic continued to play Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls, disregarding what Camp Mystic knew would be an unspeakable tragedy when the flood hit those cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  Watts argued that it is not correct that FEMA was petitioned: “The bottom line is that Camp Mystic was there before FEMA was ever promulgated by Congress. It didn’t even exist. The original maps, with all due respect to the forefathers of FEMA, were kind of done on paper and crayon. It wasn’t very scientific. Now we have digital imagery. We have elevation to a 10th of an inch. We know what’s actually in a 100-year floodplain.”\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in  a statement  last week.\n \n\n   \n    A preventable disaster\n \n\n   \n  Although camp representatives say the Eastland family prioritized the children’s safety, the narrative presented in the families’ lawsuits — which the defense has not yet formally answered to — offers a starkly different account of what happened:\n \n\n   \n  In their final hours, Camp Mystic’s young campers, many of whom likely still slept with  stuffed animals  and needed help braiding their hair, faced a terror their parents can barely bring themselves to imagine.\n \n\n   \n  As the dark waters crept across their cabin floors, inch by inch, some of the girls climbed onto their top bunks, trying to keep their heads above the rising flood, feeling the current tug at their legs.\n \n\n   \n  Others spent their last panicked moments in darkness, surrounded by cries and the roar of a river that had swallowed the world outside.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the campers piled into Richard “Dick” Eastland’s Tahoe, desperate to escape the neck-deep water.\n \n\n   \n  His car was submerged and found the next day, appearing to have been “smashed against a tree. All inside were killed,” said the lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors.\n \n\n   \n  “Their parents are left to live every single day for the rest of their lives with the intense grief de and the thoughts of what their babies endured that fateful night,” says the lawsuit filed by the families of Virginia “Wynne” Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane “Janie” Hunt, Lucy Lee Dillon, and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  What haunts them most is the belief that their daughters didn’t have to die.\n \n\n   \n  According to the lawsuits, the camp had no meaningful evacuation plan. Even as floodwaters breached the cabins, no order to flee was given until it was far too late — despite the fact that safer ground was just a few hundred feet away. A hill only 20 yards from Bubble Inn could have been reached “in a matter of seconds,” one of the lawsuits says.\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic’s entire emergency plan fit on a single page, offering a few instructions for all potential disasters, according to the same lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  The last two lines of the document instructed children to remain inside their cabins during flooding and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  Watts  told CNN  that the camp’s decision to keep everyone sheltered in place followed long-standing safety guidance from local and national authorities, who warned against moving through floodwaters.\n \n\n   \n  The parents allege that for years, the camp concealed that many cabins sat in or near dangerous floodplains, and that the camp lacked even the most basic tools like walkie-talkies, communication protocols and a real plan to protect their daughters. Counselors and campers, they say, were left to improvise.\n \n\n   \n  The camp  responded  to the allegations outlined in the lawsuits last week.\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n    The aftermath and denial\n \n\n   \n  Camp Mystic has announced plans to  partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary.\n \n\n   \n  The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  While parents remain frozen in the darkest chapter of their lives, still waking to the nightmares of what their daughters endured, still fighting for answers, they say Camp Mystic has already begun turning the page.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten  says that even as families were learning to live with an empty bed, the camp was promoting its reopening, soliciting donations and preparing to return “to business as usual.” The filing calls it “not only unthinkable – it is offensive to the memories of the deceased and the families and loved ones they left behind.”\n \n\n   \n  To the parents, the message felt unmistakable: the camp was ready to move on, eager to reopen its gates for summer 2026, while they remained knee-deep in grief, still fighting for the truth.\n \n\n   \n  The grieving families of five other girls later joined the Getten lawsuit. Linnie Anne McCown, Abby Lynn Pohl, Margaret Gaffney Sheedy, Mary Barrett Stevens and Greta Katherine Toranzo were just 8 to 10 years old when floodwater swept them away.\n \n\n   \n  “The horrifying nature of these girls’ untimely deaths cannot be overstated,” the updated lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “The overpowering waters cascading through the Camp … did the inevitable by tearing children away from the roofs, doors, furniture, trees, and hands of others that they clung to, and propelling them down the raging river into the inescapable darkness.”\n \n\n   \n  Months after the flood, the families say they have yet to hear meaningful acknowledgment or responsibility from those in charge. The lawsuits describe an institution concerned more with its reputation than its reckoning — fixated on reopening a for-profit camp while parents struggle through a grief that has no end date.\n \n\n   \n  The world may be ready to move on. But these families cannot — not until someone answers for what happened to their daughters.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Curt Devine, Casey Tolan, Pamela Brown, Shoshana Dubnow and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/ariana-grande-wicked-singapore-intrusion-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"08:17:00-04:00","title":"‘Serial intruder’ who accosted Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore sentenced to 9 days in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Australian man known as 'Pyjama Man,' Johnson Wen, was sentenced to nine days in prison in Singapore for causing a public nuisance by rushing pop star Ariana Grande during a Wicked: For Good premiere at Universal Studios Singapore.

during a Wicked premiere in Singapore was sentenced to 9 days in jail Monday for being a public nuisance.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson Wen, 26, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing annoyance to the public after he jumped over the barricade at a premiere for “Wicked: For Good” on November 13 and rushed toward Grande, according to  Singaporean news channel CNA. \n \n\n   \n   Video of the interaction  showed Wen running up to Grande and throwing his arms around her as she walked the yellow carpet with the Wicked cast at Universal Studios Singapore.\n \n\n   \n  Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo stepped in to push Wen away from the pop star, who appeared shocked, before security guards tackled him.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Grande’s representatives for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Wen, who goes by “Pyjama Man” on social media and calls himself the “Most Hated” troll, is a serial stage crasher.\n \n\n   \n  He was charged by Australian police after he interrupted a Katy Perry concert in Sydney earlier this year,  according to CNN-affiliate 9 News.  An Instagram page under his name also includes videos of Wen crashing concerts by the Chainsmokers and The Weeknd, as well as sports events including the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n \n\n   \n  In a video of the intrusion posted to Instagram last week, Wen thanked Grande for “letting me jump on the yellow carpet with you.”\n \n\n   \n  Social media users criticized Wen in the comments, calling his actions “unhinged” and “embarrassing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Rushing a woman – any woman, let alone someone who has survived unimaginable trauma – is not a ‘prank.’ It’s not ‘a stunt.’ It’s not ‘funny.’ It’s pathetic, dangerous, and shows a total lack of respect for boundaries, safety, and basic human decency,” said one Instagram user.\n \n\n   \n  Grande has  spoken openly  about suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester, United Kingdom in May 2017, which killed 22 people.\n \n\n   \n  Grande has not commented publicly on the counter with Wen. Erivo alluded to it during a special Screen Actors Guild screening in Los Angeles Saturday, according to  Entertainment Weekly. \n \n\n   \n  Sitting next to Grande, Erivo said “We have come through some s****. We have come through some stuff in our lives, in our daily workings.

You should be mindful that there are always consequences for one’s actions,” the judge said, adding he hoped the prison sentence would end Wen’s behavior “for good.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/baltimore-key-bridge-rebuild-cost-doubles","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00.000-05:00","title":"Costs more than double to rebuild vital Baltimore bridge destroyed by cargo ship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed in March 2024 after a cargo ship, the Dali, struck one of its pillars due to catastrophic electrical failures that disabled its propulsion and steering systems.

even with an artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The term was coined in 1956 by sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl, who wanted to describe how television viewers formed “para-social” relationships with TV personalities, the dictionary said in a statement Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  This phenomenon continues today, as social media users form parasocial relationships with celebrities, influencers and online personalities with whom they have no personal connection.\n \n\n   \n  A key example cited by Cambridge Dictionary is singer Taylor Swift, who announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce this year, with many fans talking of their heartfelt feelings toward a couple that the vast majority had never met.\n \n\n   \n  Another is British singer Lily Allen, whose latest album “West End Girl” tells the story of a breakup and sparked a “parasocial interest in her love life,” according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  And use of the term has surged this year, particularly as concerns over the connections that some people have started to develop with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have come to the fore.\n \n\n   \n  Colin McIntosh, a lexicographer at the Cambridge Dictionary, said the word “captures the 2025 zeitgeist” and demonstrates how language changes.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a specialist academic term has become mainstream,” he said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,” McIntosh added.\n \n\n   \n  “The language around parasocial phenomena is evolving fast, as technology, society and culture shift and mutate: from celebrities to chatbots, parasocial trends are fascinating for those who are interested in the development of language,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Simone Schnall, Professor of Experimental Social Psychology at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement that the word “is an inspired choice.”\n \n\n   \n  “The rise of parasocial relationships has redefined fandom, celebrity and, with AI, how ordinary people interact online,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,” Schnall added.\n \n\n   \n  “This leads to a sense that people ‘know’ those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it’s completely one sided.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambridge Dictionary also highlighted a number of other words that it said have had a “significant impact” this year.\n \n\n   \n  Among their number is “slop,” defined as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by artificial intelligence,” as well as “memeify,” or “to turn an event, image, person, etc. into a meme.”\n \n\n   \n  And the dictionary added 6,000 new words this year, with notable newbies including “delulu,” “skibidi” and “tradwife.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/air-traffic-controller-shortage-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"America is grappling with an air traffic controller shortage.

Can AI help? \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest  government shutdown  in US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands of  delayed or canceled flights .\n \n\n   \n  But even the  end of the shutdown  doesn’t fix the the broader  air traffic controller shortage  that’s been plaguing American flyers for years. Artificial intelligence, with its ability to analyze troves of data and potentially upend industries, might be able to help. After all, some in the field have called AI as impactful on everyday life as  electricity  or  fire. \n \n\n   \n  While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data on  weather patterns  or  aircraft trajectories , experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won’t be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a human system, and it’s human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.”\n \n\n   \n    Why AI won’t replace traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, described the job as demanding “unique skill and precision” in his  written testimony  for a hearing in March before the US House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. He called air traffic controllers the “backbone” of the National Airspace System, adding that they “require rigorous training, a mastery of complex systems, and the ability to perform under immense pressure.”\n \n\n   \n  That pressure is exactly why the job can’t be outsourced to AI, according to Sagun. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller’s voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it’s unclear whether AI can detect those cues.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added.\n \n\n   \n  There’s little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n \n\n   \n  And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn’t 100% reliable.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn’t be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the one thing that humans are very poor at doing — that very quickly, you lose vigilance, generally through boredom,” McCormick said.\n \n\n   \n    How AI could be helpful for air traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  With many air traffic controllers  either retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown,  such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan  indicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation.\n \n\n   \n  Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developed  an AI system  for monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots.\n \n\n   \n  The technology is being used at London’s Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy.\n \n\n   \n  The company says on its website that the technology isn’t a replacement for human control. It’s seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backed   by infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA’s air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffy  said in May . But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffy  recently told reporters  at a press conference.\n \n\n   \n  “The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems. “We’re in initial stages. We’re not far down the road.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/style/why-women-art-less-valuable-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-04:00","title":"Why we pay less for art made by women","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the persistent gender disparity in the art market, where works by women are consistently undervalued compared to those by men.

That record is currently held by Georgia O’Keeffe’s 1932 painting “Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1,” which fetched $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Auctioneers at Sotheby’s have valued “El sueño (La cama)” — “The Dream (The Bed)” — at between $40 and $60 million. Kahlo, who died in 1954, already holds the second-highest auction record for a female artist. “Diego y yo” (“Diego and I”), a self-portrait from 1949, featuring her husband, the artist Diego Rivera, fetched $34.9 million in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  While these are hefty price tags, they are dwarfed by the equivalent for works by men. Even if Kahlo’s painting hits the upper valuation, it will be just a fraction of the male record. Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” sold for an astounding  $450.3 million at Christies in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  The gender gap is not limited to dead artists. Earlier this year, South African Marlene Dumas — who only last week became the first contemporary female artist to join the  Louvre’s  permanent collection — set a record for the highest amount paid for a living female artist. “Miss January,” a large-scale portrait of a semi-nude woman, sold for $13.6 million in May, topping Jenny Saville’s “Propped,” which sold for $12.4 million in 2018. Dumas’ record is not even 15% of the current record for a work by a living male artist  –  Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” sculpture, which sold for just north of $91 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  So what is behind this massive disparity? Experts believe misogyny, ageism and male-dominated auction houses and museums are factors influencing how art by women is valued.\n \n\n   \n  A 2021 study highlighted a stark gender bias in how society perceives art. Renée B. Adams, a professor of finance at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, was the lead author of “Gendered Prices,” published in  The Review of Financial Studies  that year.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers showed two groups of participants an identical series of AI-generated artworks and asked them to rate them. One group was shown the works with a male artist’s signature, while others saw the attribution as female. The works supposedly signed by a man were rated higher by regular gallery-goers than those apparently done by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Adams is currently studying secret postcard auctions, where the artist is supposedly anonymous. “Sometimes, in order to attract people to bid on these postcards, they get very famous artists to participate,” she said, adding that in those cases an artist’s identity can often be inferred from their style.\n \n\n   \n  “If buyers can’t infer identity, there’s no gender difference in price, but as soon as they think they know who the person is, there’s a gender difference in price.”\n \n\n   \n  Adams said the “magnitude” of the gap in the art world stands out from other sectors. “The art market blows all the gender wage gap numbers out of the water,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount in art prices is not driven by merit, but by factors related to societal perceptions of women. It has nothing to do with whether the painting is good or bad.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of her research for her 2020 book “Women Can’t Paint,” artist, writer and art historian Helen Gørrill took a forensic approach to auctioned art.\n \n\n   \n  “I created a spreadsheet of 5,000 paintings on the secondary market, so at big auctions like Sotheby’s, Christie’s, Phillips,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This led to a startling discovery. Art signed by a man went up in value compared to unsigned work, and women’s artwork actually went down in value when signed, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She believes the art establishment highlights the success of artists like Saville, Kahlo, Bridget Riley and Yayoi Kusama to suggest progress.\n \n\n   \n  “The ones that are doing really well are being bandied up as an example of how well women are doing, but when you analyze it, we’re not at all,” she said. “In the ’90s, we had far more women succeeding. Now the success is being shared by far fewer women, but on a greater scale,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill is currently working on two more books on the subject and said her latest research is no less alarming. Gørrill spoke to artists who were dismissed after having a baby and told their work couldn’t be sold “because people don’t trust it’s going to achieve the value of a male artist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I spoke to some big dealers and they all said their collectors lose trust in women once they’ve had a kid because they’re no longer going to be able to focus fully on their artwork,” she said. “So the value of a woman artist essentially dips because of biology.”\n \n\n   \n  The belief has even been internalized by some in the profession, among them renowned British artist Tracey Emin. In an 2014 interview, she told  Red  Magazine that she thought having children would compromise her work. “There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.”\n \n\n   \n  Ageism, and even beauty standards, have also been been cited as issues women face. Gørrill told CNN that one artist she spoke to recalled a dealer telling her to get Botox because “she looked haggard.” She added: “Her exact words to me were, ‘but men are allowed to be old and ugly.’”\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill lays much of the blame for the situation at the door of museums. “By museums not collecting as many female artists as men, it has a massive impact on collections and on values attributed on the secondary market to artwork, and also what collectors perceive as being valuable or validated as an artwork.”\n \n\n   \n  Valeria Napoleone, an Italian art collector and patron, has spent almost three decades building a collection by women artists. When she started in 1997, she “couldn’t understand why women were sidelined just because of gender,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I told myself ‘I want to create a choir of female voices who have been silenced throughout art history.’” Today, some 560 artworks are spread between her homes and storage units in London, New York and Milan.\n \n\n   \n  While the “discourse” in the wider art world around gender equality has changed, according to Napoleone, there remains a “black hole” when it comes to museums and auction houses, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “As radical as the world of contemporary art is believed to be, it’s a male-dominated field in terms of artists, museums, directors — the whole ecosystem.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s very important to readdress art history through the eyes of a new generation of curators. You don’t want female artists to be like a decorative object on a man’s suit. You want the artist to become part of the fibre of the suit,” she said. “It’s going to take generations to balance it.”\n \n\n   \n  Harriet Loffler is curator at The Women’s Art Collection at Murray Edwards College at Cambridge University — the biggest collection of women’s art in Europe — is more upbeat.\n \n\n   \n  She welcomed the Kahlo auction for “shining a light” on the representation of women. “These success stories are fantastic for women artists,” she told CNN, adding that there have always been female artists but the “canonical” approach to art history has centred on men.\n \n\n   \n  While the museum houses works by such luminaries as Barbara Hepworth, Mary Cassatt, Paula Rego and Tracey Emin, “what’s amazing about our collection is that it’s a constellation not stars,” she told CNN. “The artists aren’t all talking about what it is to be a woman, but they all have something to say. They take up space and there are a number of works that really talk about the symbolic erasure of women artists across art history.”\n \n\n   \n  She believes things are changing, with museums taking affirmative action to redress the imbalance but said: “There is still lots of work to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the Atlantic, the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) was established in Washington DC in the 1980s “in part to rectify the lack of representation of women across art history,” according to Kathryn Wat, its chief curator and deputy director for art, programs and public engagement.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that engaging a global audience is critical to changing the landscape for women artists,” Wat said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “While women artists have greater recognition now, disparities in scholarly research, the content of museum collections, and market value persist. Statistically women artists continue to be undervalued and overlooked by the broader art market. Our dual mission of advocacy and exhibition remains essential,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The legacy of gender inequality continues to influence economic valuation. Having more and deeper research, more exhibitions, and further exposure of women artists will have an impact on their value within the art market.”\n \n\n   \n  Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s, agrees. “In recent years, we’ve witnessed a real and measurable shift — not just in awareness, but also in market confidence and increasing gallery representation and institutional support for women artists,” she said, adding “outstanding results” have been achieved by other female artists, including O’Keeffe and Lee Krasner.\n \n\n   \n  While “El sueño (La cama)” may prove record-breaking, Di Stasi believes “what’s also exciting is the idea of that record continuing to be broken by other artists in the years to come.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/europe/italy-women-femicides-challenges-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:32:00-05:00","title":"Italy’s Femicide Crisis: Critics Urge Prime Minister Meloni to Do More","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Italy is grappling with a rising rate of femicide, with over 70 women killed due to gender-based violence—including Pamela Genini, a young entrepreneur stabbed by her ex-boyfriend—highlighting deep-seated issues in gender safety and systemic inequality.

Critics say Prime Minister Georgia Meloni should do more to fix it \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Italian model and entrepreneur Pamela Genini had what many might consider an enviable life. The 29-year-old Milan resident was a successful real estate agent focused on high-commission seaside properties. A thriving influencer who was discovered on a popular reality TV program a decade earlier, she had just launched her own swimwear line with an influencer friend.\n \n\n   \n  In a country where the rate of unemployment and precarious employment for the under-30s is  stubbornly high ,  Genini had broken the mold.\n \n\n   \n  But one evening in mid-October, Genini’s 52-year-old ex-boyfriend Gianluca Soncin is alleged to have entered her apartment and fatally stabbed her. Police were called but arrived to find her dead on her balcony. Soncin was at her side, the investigating judge in the case said.\n \n\n   \n  Soncin, currently in solitary confinement awaiting formal charges, faces accusations of voluntary homicide, cruelty, stalking, and premeditation. His lawyer told CNN he had not yet answered any questions about what happened.\n \n\n   \n  Genini was the 72nd victim of femicide – usually defined as when a girl or woman is killed because of her gender, often by a current or former intimate partner – in Italy in 2025, according to the observatory group Non Una Di Meno (Not One Less), which keeps a tally of such killings. Four more women have been killed since Genini, according to the group, including Luciana Ronchi, 62, and 80-year-old Vanda Venditti. Six more cases are being examined as potential femicides.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, there were 116 cases of femicide, according to Non Una Di Meno, a slight decrease from the previous two years.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, Giorgia Meloni became Italy’s first female prime minister. Critics question whether she has  done enough  since to tackle increasing rates of violence against women in the country, or challenge persistent inequality in the workplace. Official figures show that birth rates dropped by 6.3% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and that some Italian women earn up to 40% less than men in the same jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Italy’s battle with femicide goes back decades. Meloni’s government has passed anti-stalking legislation tied to  previous femicides , and has made domestic violence an aggravating factor in sentencing, meaning those who are convicted in domestic violence cases now face longer prison terms for offenses, including life sentences in some cases.\n \n\n   \n  But many believe Meloni has not done as much in terms of prevention as they had expected.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s Education Ministry last week pushed forward a law that upholds the current ban on teaching sex education in kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, a curriculum  long seen by experts  as a precursor to educating young people about domestic violence and consent, with an eye to prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni, who changed the name of the long-standing Ministry for Equal Opportunity to the Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities upon her election, has framed the continuing ban on sex education as a way to prevent the introduction of “woke gender theory” in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But opposition groups argue that denying young people exposure to basic sex education keeps the country grounded in its patriarchal past. “While Europe moves forward, Italy is returning to the Middle Ages,” opposition parliamentarian Alessandro Zan said last week.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s office declined CNN’s request for comment on the issue, but she has in the past denied being against advancing women’s interests. As a single mother who supports the traditional family, she has  insisted  that it is “ridiculous” to accuse her of not doing enough for women.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fake news against me,” she said recently, in an address she posted on her TikTok account. She consistently points to her government’s pledge to expand parental rights and give tax breaks to families based on the number of children they have. The Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities also declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Italy is one of the last European countries not to have compulsory sex education in the public school system, despite evidence  cited  by the United Nations that effective sex education offers an opportunity to teach about gender-based violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the  potential for domestic violence  that makes being a woman in Italy feel so challenging. Parity indicators, which include employment and confidence in having a family, are increasingly dismal. In 2024, Italy’s already low birth rate fell once again, to 1.18, marking the 16th year in a row of steady decline,  according  to Italy’s ISTAT national statistical institute. Provisional figures for the first seven months of 2025 showed a further drop, to 1.13.\n \n\n   \n  Women are blamed for not having babies, including by Meloni, who has touted the traditional family and pushed forward legislation  criminalizing surrogacy  and allowing anti-abortion activists to access clinics. At an event in 2023, Meloni said too many young women were being pressured to focus on their careers first, and put off having children.\n \n\n   \n  Her critics say, however, that she has done little to help provide affordable child care options, despite campaign promises ahead of the 2022 election that launched her to power. Instead, proposed plans to build day-care centers were  slashed  from her first budget.\n \n\n   \n  The ISTAT fertility report identifies several factors in the declining birth rate, including an increasingly small pool of potential parents due to the lower number of babies born in the country since the 1970s. “Employment insecurity, particularly the prevalence of temporary work contracts, and low wages, also have a heavy impact on Italy’s falling birth rate,” the study says.\n \n\n   \n  Ariana Ricci, a 32-year-old human resources manager, voted for Meloni’s hard-right Brothers of Italy party in 2022, hoping she would prioritize efforts to tackle wage disparity, reproductive rights, and women’s safety. Ricci, who graduated from the prestigious Bocconi University in Milan, also studied overseas but says she wants to stay in Italy and be successful there, raise a family and own her own home.\n \n\n   \n  At the moment, however, she’s renting a room in a student apartment-share in Rome in order to avoid moving back in with her parents. She says she’s barely able to pay her rent and utility bills. She is easily employable on paper, but falls into the “precarious” job set, meaning no one will give her the coveted permanent contract, which comes with job security and ample benefits, but which research shows tends to be offered first to men.\n \n\n   \n  Ricci works on temporary contracts, which do not afford her job security, but have become an increasingly common way for companies to avoid paying generous benefits, especially mandatory maternity leave. Men are not granted paternity leave in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “If I were to start a family on a temporary contract, I wouldn’t get my maternity leave paid, I wouldn’t get my job back, and I couldn’t afford childcare even if I did have a job to go back to,” she said. “What incentive is that to have a family?”\n \n\n   \n  She had hoped a female leader would see the bind many young, employable women seem to be in. “I’m seeing a focus on international affairs instead,” she told CNN. “Meloni has made Italy look great abroad, but she has forgotten us here in Italy in many ways.”\n \n\n   \n  The World Economic Forum’s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report  ranks Italy 85th out of 148 countries on issues like economic participation and opportunity, education, health, and political empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  While Italy has risen two rankings since Meloni’s election, it remains among the lowest-placed countries in Europe for the overall gender gap. Notably, Italy fell to 117th place on women’s economic participation, dropping six points since the 2024 report.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s participation in Italy’s labor market has slumped in the past two years to a rate of 41.5% while men enjoy nearly 60% participation. And they earn up to 40% less than men in some sectors, according to the Global Gender Gap Report.\n \n\n   \n  Only 39% of management positions in Italy are held by women, and just 7% of Italian companies have female CEOs, according to  research  published last year by the Bocconi School of Management’s Executive Women Observatory.\n \n\n   \n  Elly Schlein, the leader of Italy’s main opposition Democratic Party, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Meloni government’s record on women’s issues.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on a TV program last week about new budget cuts proposed by Meloni’s government that are currently under debate in the Italian senate, Schlein said: “The hardest hit are women. When you cut welfare, schools, and funding for services for people with disabilities, the burden of care falls on families, and within families, on women.”\n \n\n   \n  But not all women agree. Beatrice Costa couldn’t be happier with Meloni as she sits at a coffee bar in central Rome, holding her six-month-old baby in her arms. Her three-year-old is around the corner in a state-run nursery school until lunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I have permission to be a mother,” Costa told CNN, explaining that she had felt pressure growing up to have a career over family, or at least start her career first before thinking about becoming a mother. “The pressure not to have children is strong, the pressure to work outside the home, to give up the dream of having a family, to just get a dog instead, is hard to fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Costa, who has a university degree in communications, had already given birth to her first child when Meloni was elected. “I don’t know if we had a second child because of her focus on the traditional family, or if we would have anyway, but I’m glad I am empowered to be a mother,” she said, adding that her husband has a good job as a tax accountant and that they were given a home by her parents, who also help with childcare.\n \n\n   \n  “Some might say I have it easy, but I feel like I’m carrying out an Italian tradition and finally I have permission to do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/china/china-lending-us-biggest-recipient-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00-04:00","title":"In China’s global lending spree, the US has been the biggest beneficiary, study finds","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report by AidData reveals that despite common assumptions, the United States has become the largest recipient of Chinese state-backed overseas lending, receiving over $200 billion in loans between 2000 and 2023.

November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Washington has spent years warning countries about the dangers of accepting Chinese loans. But over the past two decades the United States has been the largest recipient globally.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the finding of a new report by AidData, a research lab at William & Mary university in Virginia, which has compiled the most expansive public database to date on China’s overseas lending activities.\n \n\n   \n  The findings, released Tuesday, reveal that government or majority state-owned Chinese entities loaned or granted $2.2 trillion of aid and credit spread across more than 200 countries between 2000 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  And at the top of that list of recipients is the US – a finding that the researchers say stands counter to a common assumption that Chinese financing has mainly poured into developing nations, for example under the auspices of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s flagship infrastructure drive the Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, more than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now back projects and activities in upper-middle income and high-income countries, AidData found – and has been used on critical infrastructure, critical minerals, and the acquisition of high-tech assets critical to China’s national security goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The US and its allies in the wealthy, industrialized world have allowed Chinese state-owned creditors to finance critical infrastructure assets within their own jurisdictions. They’ve allowed them to finance the acquisition of critical minerals within their jurisdictional boundaries. They’ve allowed Chinese companies to use loans to buy their technological crown jewels,” AidData executive director Bradley Parks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the better part of the last decade, Washington has been warning countries that, in its view, Beijing is a predatory lender that will take control of another country’s assets if those loans fall into distress, Parks added.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s second largest economy has emerged as the world’s largest official creditor as it vied to position itself as the go-to financial ally for developing countries. Along the way it also came in for significant criticism that its practices saddled countries with unsustainable debt – a charge Beijing denies. Some  analysts  have also pushed back against the debt-trap narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the latest AidData shows that the US, as the top of the recipient of Chinese official sector financing, has received more than $200 billion for nearly 2,500 projects and activities that can be found in nearly every state in the country.\n \n\n   \n  More than half that credit was in the form of liquidity support to corporations, a kind of financing where Chinese creditors – often as one entity in a syndicate of many international financial institutions – act as a credit line for major companies that need cash.\n \n\n   \n  Such transactions are a common corporate practice and way for banks to make money – and they would not give Chinese firms a stake in companies or control over the borrowers, which have included Fortune 500 companies.\n \n\n   \n  But Chinese state-owned entities have also financed the acquisition of US high-tech companies and bankrolled infrastructure including LNG projects, energy pipelines, power transmission lines and airport terminals since 2000, the researchers found.\n \n\n   \n  Transactions involving sensitive sectors have become increasingly difficult in the US in recent years as regulatory scrutiny tightened amid growing concern in Washington about the national security implications of China’s financial stake in America. Chinese entities have looked to other high-income nations with less robust checks, AidData found.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom has received $60 billion and EU member states $161 billion over the 24-year study period, according to AidData.\n \n\n   \n  Like with the US, there has also been increased scrutiny and warnings in Britain and Europe over the levels of Chinese investment, particularly in critical infrastructure, in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not claiming and we don’t believe that all of this lending to the US serves some sort of grand geopolitical or geoeconomic strategy – some of it is really just about the pursuit of profit … China’s financial sector is just dominated by the state,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, judging which transactions are “benign and (which) are not” constitutes a key challenge for regulators and national security officials.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Aligned with the policy’\n \n\n   \n  AidData researchers found “increasing alignment between China’s cross-border lending activities and the policy priorities of the party-state, including those related to national security and economic statecraft,” the team said in their report.\n \n\n   \n  In particular, the “Made In China 2025” initiative appeared linked to shifting priorities in outbound lending, according to the findings. The government plan, released in 2015, was meant to spur China’s development in advanced technologies, especially in high priority sectors that included robotics and automation, aerospace, and computing.\n \n\n   \n  “You see this rapid ramp up in cross-border acquisition lending that is aligned with that policy, and (Chinese entities) start lending for the 10 sectors that were that were identified in Made in China 2025,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  That enabled Chinese firms to acquire strategically significant assets using state capital to fill the gap in their own funds, according to Parks, who noted there is “no real analog” to that kind of practice in wealthy industrialized countries.\n \n\n   \n  Examples cited in the report of such high-tech company acquisitions in the US over the past two decades include semiconductor firm OmniVision Technologies, automation firm the Paslin Company and electronics company Ingram Micro, which was subsequently bought by an American private equity firm after the earlier acquisition.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state-owned creditors have also played a role in Beijing’s access around the world to critical minerals needed for high-tech goods, approving over 100 loan commitments worth $14 billion for overseas critical mineral operations between 2021 and 2023 globally.\n \n\n   \n  As Beijing focused on strategic sectors and its banks became creditors to wealthy Western firms, the overall share of overseas lending and grant-giving that supports low-income and lower-middle income countries has also fallen. Once accounting for some 88% of those activities in 2000, they now account for 24%, according to the findings.\n \n\n   \n  Another shift, according to Parks, has been how Western governments are looking at the Chinese government’s strategy.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rivals in the G7 are responding by making major adjustments that were once inconceivable—for example, slashing overseas development aid budgets, dismantling foreign aid agencies, ramping up cross-border lending on non-concessional terms, and taking equity stakes in critical infrastructure assets overseas, the report found.\n \n\n   \n  The US under the second Trump administration has imposed massive cuts to America’s international aid program, but there are efforts in Washington to vastly expand the budget of the US International Development Finance Corporation and its ability to disburse loans in high-income countries.\n \n\n   \n  Not long ago, according to Parks, “Beijing’s approach to international lending and grant-giving was a source of scorn or ridicule … it just was not a source of inspiration or emulation for policymakers in the G7, and now everything is turned upside down – now the US and its allies are really focused on competing with China on its terms.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-18:00","title":"Trump Urges Release of Epstein Files; Public Access to Records Under Scrutiny","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee is poised to vote on a measure to force the release of federal records related to the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case, with over 300 gigabytes of data stored in the FBI’s Sentinel system.

The investigation has extended beyond Epstein’s estate to include potential ties to high-profile figures such as Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, and JPMorgan Chase, with Attorney General Pam Bondi assigning Jay Clayton to lead the federal probe. Public access has been driven by civil lawsuits, FBI search warrants, and the release of documents from Epstein’s estate, though many records, especially sensitive or protected ones, remain sealed or inaccessible. The article underscores the enduring public fascination with Epstein’s case due to its ties to powerful individuals and the unresolved questions about accountability.","keyTakeAways":["The Epstein

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday to force the release of records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for President Donald Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The documents were released just hours before the swearing in of  Adelita Grijalva  as the House’s newest Democrat, which had been long delayed amid the government shutdown. Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva became the decisive 218th member in support of the effort to force the House to vote on the release of this different set of documents — all of the Epstein documents that the Justice Department has access to.\n \n\n   \n  The vote is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but that alone won’t trigger the release of the documents. If the measure passes, it will still face an uncertain future in the Senate — even after Trump reversed his previous position Sunday and publicly urged for the release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Some, like those in Wednesday’s release, came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records Wednesday, announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell, Prince Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   A version of this story originally published in July 2025.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/thailand-monkey-trafficking-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:01:00-04:00","title":"Monkeys, meth and mesh bags: Thai police arrest two for alleged animal trafficking","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thai police have arrested two Thai nationals for allegedly trafficking 143 long-tailed macaques in blue nylon mesh bags near the Cambodian border, with 62 monkeys found in a sugarcane field and 81 in a pickup truck.

a quantity of methamphetamine, authorities said, in one of two cases that saw 143 monkeys rescued from suspected wildlife smugglers in a single day.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand is an international hub for

first case, rangers were patrolling in southeast Thailand’s Khlong Hat District, near the border with Cambodia, when they heard “unusual animal noises” coming from a sugarcane field, according to a press release from Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation (DNP).\n \n\n   \n  After checking the area, the authorities found 10 plastic baskets hidden in the sugarcane containing 62 long-tailed macaques, a monkey native to Southeast Asia   which is widely used in drug development because its DNA closely mirrors that of humans.\n \n\n   \n  There is also a thriving black market for the species, which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys – 44 males and 18 females – were bound inside blue nylon mesh bags, according to the press release.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys were in a weakened state and were transferred to a local wildlife rescue center.\n \n\n   \n  Later that afternoon, rangers were patrolling in neighboring Aranyaprathet District when they spotted two men unloading blue mesh bags from a pickup truck on a country road near the Cambodian border, the DNP said.\n \n\n   \n  After a car chase, police arrested two male suspects, who they identified as Thai nationals.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the car they found 81 long-tailed macaques – 30 males, 51 females – tightly packed in mesh bags, as well as methamphetamine, according to the release. The monkeys were also transferred to the wildlife rescue center for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  The suspects are facing offenses related to possessing and trading protected wildlife without permission, as well as charges for possessing and consuming illicit drugs, the DNP release said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a police statement, the suspects in the second case said they were hired to smuggle the monkeys into Cambodia.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of consecutive cases like this confirms that the border area remains a target for wildlife trafficking networks, especially for long-tailed macaques, which are in high demand internationally,” said Somruek Suppamitkrisana, Director of the Wildlife Conservation Division.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Thai police arrested a man after he was found with  two baby orangutans  in a basket at a gas station in Bangkok.\n \n\n   \n  Last November, Thailand repatriated home to Myanmar  almost 1,000 highly endangered tortoises and lemurs , which they recovered during an anti-trafficking operation.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024,  an endangered red panda  was found alongside 86 other animals inside luggage at Bangkok airport, bound for Mumbai, customs authorities said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-venezuela-strike-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Trump Hints at Diplomatic Window with Maduro but Muses About Hitting Drug Facilities in Other Countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signaled openness to diplomatic talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, despite previously cutting off diplomatic outreach, while simultaneously expressing willingness to launch military strikes against drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia.

Liptak, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:21 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has yet to make a decision on whether to attack  Venezuela  on land, a White House official and a senior US official said, as he hints a window may be opening for diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Trump made clear his willingness to go after drug operations on land using military force — including, he said, in Mexico and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “We know their address. We know their address. We know everything about every one of them,” he said of drug cartel leaders, adding he would be “proud” to strike drug facilities in other countries in his attempt to prevent the substances from reaching the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?” he said. “That’s OK with me.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Venezuela, Trump declined to rule out sending US troops, saying he doesn’t “rule out anything.”\n \n\n   \n  But as American military forces amass in the region — including the most advanced US aircraft carrier and 15,000 personnel — Trump is hoping the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, the US official said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I probably would talk to him,” Trump said Monday when asked whether he’d speak with his Venezuelan counterpart before ordering strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart.\n \n\n   \n  “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” Maduro said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “We reaffirm that only through diplomacy should free countries and governments understand each other, and only through dialogue should they seek common ground on issues of mutual interest,” the Venezuelan leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Potential talks between Trump and Maduro are still very preliminary, a senior White House official told CNN. Maduro and his associates have reached out through multiple channels with a desire to open a line of communication.\n \n\n   \n  Even though Trump has expressed interest in he or his administration potentially holding those talks, it was not immediately clear who might be a part of those conversations. Initially, Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy, had been leading negotiations with top Venezuelan officials before Trump instructed him to end all diplomatic outreach last month.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s interest in potentially reopening diplomatic communications comes as the US military has continued to grow its presence near the South American country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump received briefings on military options on three consecutive days last week. The options ranged in intensity, from strikes on military or government facilities to special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, at points, voiced some reservations about taking direct military action inside Venezuela. He’s questioned the risks posed for US troops and asked about the likelihood of success.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is also attuned to fresh criticism from some of his allies that his attention is overly focused abroad, rather than on domestic matters.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear what signals the administration had received that Maduro was prepared for a fresh round of diplomacy. Last month, amid quiet efforts at brokering an agreement with Caracas, Trump instructed his team to cut off diplomatic outreach to Maduro and top Venezuelan officials.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Trump and senior officials were frustrated Maduro wasn’t agreeing to step down voluntarily. On Monday, David Smolansky, an advisor to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that the mounting U.S. pressure was weakening Maduro’s hold on power.\n \n\n   \n  “They are cracking. Actually, they are cracking. And there is a lot of tensions and mistrust among themselves, not only because of the operation that is in the Caribbean,” Smolansky said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes, Katrina Samaan and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with remarks from President Donald Trump.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/taiwan-handbook-china-invasion-disasters-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Taiwan rolls out handbook on how to prepare for natural disasters – and a Chinese invasion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Taiwan has released a comprehensive handbook for its 23 million residents to prepare for both natural disasters like typhoons and the threat of a military invasion by China.

and their limits. Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez’s mistaken arrival at the wrong Indiana address Wednesday  cost her her life . As the house cleaner tried to enter the home she thought was scheduled for housekeeping that morning, the homeowner fatally shot her.\n \n\n   \n  The incident is renewing questions about so-called stand-your-ground laws that can empower individuals to defend themselves, even with deadly force, if they feel threatened or in danger. But the statutes are very specific and the extent of their protection varies by state.\n \n\n   \n  Under  Indiana law , individuals may use reasonable force — including deadly force — to stop a person from unlawfully trying to enter their property. But  prosecutors say  the statute doesn’t apply to the homeowner’s actions Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about stand-your-ground laws.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground laws can empower homeowners against intruders\n \n\n   \n  Generally, stand-your-ground laws and “castle doctrines” can allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n \n\n   \n  The “castle doctrine” is the legal notion that your home is your castle, and you have the right to use lethal force to defend your home and not retreat. A number of states have enshrined the castle doctrine in statutory law, sometimes with slightly different guidelines for when deadly force can be used.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, stand-your-ground laws and policies say even when a person is outside their home, they can stay where they are without retreating, even if they can avoid the danger by retreating, according to University of California, Los Angeles, law professor Eugene Volokh.\n \n\n   \n  These statutes deal with a very specific question, according to Volokh: If someone reasonably fears death, serious bodily injury, etc., but can avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating, can that person still stay where they are and use deadly force?\n \n\n   \n  “They allow people to respond to threats of death, serious bodily injury, rape, and some other serious crimes with deadly force,” Volokh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, you “generally can’t use deadly force for self-defense in most states unless you reasonably believe that you’re facing the risk of death or serious bodily injury or some serious crime: rape, kidnapping or, in some states, robbery, burglary, or arson,”  Volokh previously wrote  on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the laws, including the National Rifle Association, say they give people the right to protect themselves, no matter where they are. Critics say the laws encourage violence and allow for  legal racial bias .\n \n\n   \n    Most states have some version of the self-defense laws\n \n\n   \n  The count of states with stand-your-ground doctrines depends on the criteria used to define them, because states word and even enforce the statutes differently.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 states, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands recognize that “there is no duty to retreat in any place in which one is lawfully present or has the right to be,” according to the  National Conference of State Legislatures . Arkansas and Ohio became the latest states to enact the legislation in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In eight states — California, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia, Vermont and Washington — that don’t have stand-your-ground laws, courts and jury instructions can allow people to use deadly force to defend themselves if they believe they are in serious danger, according to the NCSL.\n \n\n   \n  At least 23 states have laws to protect people from being sued for damages by the person they defended themselves against, the NCSL says. Six states tip the scales in the other direction, allowing even a person who wasn’t charged with a crime or found to have acted in self-defense to be sued in civil court: Hawaii, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Tennessee.\n \n\n   \n  The law has long been used in legal battles across the country\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, where the first stand-your-ground law was passed in 2005, it was used in the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who fatally shot  17-year-old Trayvon Martin  in 2012 while he was walking home from a convenience store. Zimmerman’s supporters said he was exercising his Second Amendment right to bear arms and  Florida’s stand-your-ground law  gave him immunity.\n \n\n   \n  Florida’s law allows people to meet “force with force” if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas,  jurors were allowed to consider  the “castle doctrine” in the 2018 murder case against Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who said she mistakenly entered the wrong apartment and killed Botham Jean, a 26-year-old man. In October 2019, a jury ultimately found  Guyger guilty of murdering  Jean and sentenced her to 10 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  And more recently in Texas, after an 11-year-old playing “ding-dong-ditch” was  fatally shot as he ran  from a home whose doorbell he playfully rang in August, prosecutors were quick to deny that the state’s self-defense legislation was relevant. “The castle doctrine does not apply in any way, shape or form to an 11-year-old boy running down the street,” police previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Texas law says a person can use force as a means of self-defense if they reasonably believe the force is immediately necessary to protect them against another’s use or attempted use of force.

prison \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A convicted murderer is challenging an Australian state’s ban on prisoners eating Vegemite, claiming in a court suit that withholding the polarizing yeast-based spread breaches his human right to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.”\n \n\n   \n  Andre McKechnie, 54, took his battle for the salty, sticky, brown byproduct of brewing beer to the Supreme Court of Victoria, according to documents the court registry released to The Associated Press on Tuesday. He is suing Victoria’s Department of Justice and Community Safety and the agency that manages the prisons, Corrections Victoria. The case is scheduled for trial next year.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is seeking a court declaration that the defendants denied him his right under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.”\n \n\n   \n  He also wants a declaration that the defendants breached the Corrections Act by “failing to provide food adequate to maintain” McKechnie’s “well-being.”\n \n\n   \n  He wants the court to order the decision to ban Vegemite to be “remade in accordance with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite has been banned from Victorian prisons since 2006, with Corrections Victoria saying it “interferes with narcotic detection dogs.”\n \n\n   \n  Inmates used to smear packages of illicit drugs with Vegemite in the hope that the odor would distract the dogs from the contraband.\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite also contains yeast, which is banned from Victorian prisons because of its “potential to be used in the production of alcohol,” the contraband list says.\n \n\n   \n  Manufactured in Australia since 1923 as an alternative to Britain’s Marmite, Vegemite was long marketed as a source of vitamin B for growing children.\n \n\n   \n  The spread is beloved by a majority of Australians, but typically considered an acquired taste at best by those who weren’t raised on it.\n \n\n   \n  The last US president to visit Australia, Barack Obama, once said: “It’s horrible.”\n \n\n   \n  Australian band Men at Work aroused international curiosity about the yeast-based spread when they mentioned a “Vegemite sandwich” in their 1980s hit “Down Under.”\n \n\n   \n  The band’s lead singer Colin Hay once accused American critics of laying Vegemite on too thick, blaming a “more is more” US culture.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a favorite on breakfast toast and in cheese sandwiches, with most fans agreeing it’s best applied sparingly. Australian travelers bemoan Vegemite’s scarcity overseas.\n \n\n   \n  The Australian government intervened in April when Canadian officials temporarily prevented a Toronto-based cafe from selling Vegemite in jars and on toast in a dispute media branded as “Vegemite-gate.” Canadians relented and allowed the product to be sold despite its failure to comply with local regulations dealing with food packaging and vitamin fortification.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice and Community Safety and Corrections Victoria declined to comment on Tuesday. Government agencies generally maintain it is not appropriate to comment on issues that are before the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Victims of crime advocate and lawyer John Herron said it was a frivolous lawsuit and was offensive to victims’ families.\n \n\n   \n  “As victims, we don’t have any rights. We have limited if any support. It’s always about the perpetrator, and this just reinforces that,” said Herron, whose daughter Courtney Herron, was beaten to death in a Melbourne park in 2019. Her killer was found not guilty of murder by reason of mental impairment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a case of Vegemite or Nutella or whatever it may be. It’s an extra perk that is rubbing our faces in the tragedy that we’ve suffered,” Herron added.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is currently held at maximum-security Port Phillip Prison. He was 23 years old when he stabbed to death wealthy Gold Coast property developer Otto Kuhne in Queensland state in 1994.\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to life for murder and transferred a decade later from the Queensland to the Victorian prison system.\n \n\n   \n  He wrote last year that he spent eight years free on parole in Victoria before he “decided that I had had enough.” He returned to prison and has spent the past decade in custody.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie’s lawyers didn’t respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00-05:00","title":"Stocks and Bitcoin Slide as Nerves Fray Ahead of Nvidia Earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street experienced a sharp downturn on Monday as investors grew risk-averse ahead of two major events: Nvidia’s earnings report and the delayed September jobs report.

The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  traded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks fell on Monday as investors’ nerves intensified ahead of two key events this week: Nvidia ( NVDA ), the star of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to report earnings on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have  come under pressure  this month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon﻿ths, erasing its gains for this year.

Coinbase ( COIN ), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet.

Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.\n \n\n   \n  “The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.\n \n\n   \n  “Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  “This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/palestinian-prisoner-deaths-physicians-human-rights-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:08:00-04:00","title":"At least 98 Palestinians died in Israeli prisons in two years, Israeli human rights group finds","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report by Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) documents at least 98 deaths of Palestinians in Israeli custody since October 2023, with the true number likely much higher due to missing individuals, particularly from Gaza.

After that, PHRI was able to document additional deaths using information from firsthand testimonies and official responses to requests submitted by the Palestinian Authority.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the allegations in the report, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) told CNN it “operates in accordance with the law” and that “all inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff.” It added that it does not comment on figures or allegations presented by outside organizations.\n \n\n   \n  “The claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented,” the IPS said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unprecedented’ number of deaths\n \n\n   \n  “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody over the past two years, together with clear evidence of deaths caused by torture and medical neglect, points to a deliberate Israeli policy of killing Palestinians while in detention,” Oneg Ben Dror, the project coordinator for PHRI’s prisoners and detainees department, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings — and the ongoing failure of Israeli law enforcement to prosecute those responsible — turn Israeli law itself into a fig leaf and a tool for concealment,” Ben Dror added.\n \n\n   \n  The report provides details on the deaths of Palestinians classified as “security prisoners,” which includes detainees held without charge or without trial.\n \n\n   \n  While the identities of some of those who died in Israeli custody remain unknown, the report identified 73 of the Palestinians who died. Those named in the report include  Dr. Adnan al-Bursh , 53, who was the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza and died after reported signs of “physical abuse” in prison, according to testimony from a fellow detainee who has since been released. The report also named 17-year-old  Walid Khalid Ahmad , who died following prolonged malnutrition, according to an autopsy report.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI concluded in the report that Israeli authorities have waged an “unprecedented assault on detained Palestinians,” arguing that Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took steps to “deliberately worsen conditions of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Ministry of National Security for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Ben-Gvir previously advocated for the minimum conditions by law and said that “the conditions in prison add deterrence.” He also lashed out at the Israeli Supreme Court in September after it ruled that the state was not providing adequate food to Palestinian prisoners and must improve their nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  Deaths occurred at nearly all Israeli prison facilities, which the report said “further underscores the systematic and ongoing nature of these killings in Israeli custody.”\n \n\n   \n  Among those who died in Israeli prison facilities, 17 were from Gaza, 26 were from the occupied West Bank and three held Israeli citizenship, according to the report. The data shows that “on average, two Palestinians died every month in IPS detention facilities, with the number of deaths steadily increasing over time.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  previously reported on abuse, medical neglect and horrific conditions  at the Sde Teiman field hospital at an Israeli military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel’s Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  The PHRI report found that from the start of the war through August of this year, 29 detained Palestinians from Gaza died at Sde Teiman in the custody of the Israeli military, and further deaths were recorded at military camps in southern Israel, Ofer and Anatot.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, PHRI announced it was joining leading Israeli  human rights group B’Tselem  in calling Israel’s actions in Gaza genocide. Israel has strongly rejected the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/wicked-for-good-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande","dateOfPublication":"1224-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000-05:00","title":"Ariana Grande Steps In to Support Cynthia Erivo on 'Wicked: For Good' Red Carpet After Erivo Loses Her Voice","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cynthia Erivo, who plays Glinda in the film 'Wicked: For Good,' lost her voice ahead of the New York premiere, prompting her co-star Ariana Grande to step in and provide support during a red carpet appearance on E!

However, plans were already in the works at the agency to oust him from the role, three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson, a loyalist to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, was tapped to lead FEMA even though he lacked experience in disaster management. But his time in charge has been punctuated by some eyebrow-raising moments — like in a June meeting in which he told staff he  was unaware the US has a hurricane season,  a comment DHS later insisted was a joke.\n \n\n   \n  His impending departure raises the stakes for FEMA — the agency responsible for helping Americans recover from the nation’s worst disasters — as Noem and DHS prepare for sweeping reforms that could fundamentally reshape its future.\n \n\n   \n  A FEMA official with knowledge of the decision said Karen Evans, a close Trump administration ally at DHS and FEMA’s newly appointed chief of staff, will replace Richardson.   A DHS spokesperson later said in a statement that Evans will will start in her new role on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the agencies thanked Richardson “for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s leadership faced its toughest test in July, when  catastrophic floods devastated Texas  and killed more than 130 people. As the crisis unfolded, Richardson was on vacation and unreachable for hours. He later told lawmakers he spent the entire trip in his truck, glued to his phone, coordinating the response.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Richardson was publicly silent and absent from the flood zone, surfacing more than a week later for an unannounced visit to Texas — days after President Donald Trump and Noem toured the area. He arrived in a straw hat and cowboy boots, notably lacking any FEMA insignia — a striking departure from the typical image of agency leaders on the front lines of a crisis.\n \n\n   \n  His absence was not by chance. DHS leaders had instructed FEMA to keep Richardson’s Texas trip under wraps until he left the state, deliberately shielding him from the press, three sources with knowledge of the decision said.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson later defended his leadership and told lawmakers the DHS response in Texas was a “model for how to respond to a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, the FEMA administrator is the president’s right hand for natural disasters and national emergencies. But in Trump’s second term, Richardson has been largely pushed to the sidelines, with his authority steadily diminished by Noem.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Monday, Richardson defended his short tenure at FEMA, arguing that he “didn’t hesitate” to take on the leadership post just weeks before hurricane season began.\n \n\n   \n  “I agreed to be the acting administrator through hurricane season when others wouldn’t. Hurricane season ends on 1 December. Since the danger has largely passed, I can now leave for other opportunities,” he said. “Many were asked. One raised his hand and said, ‘I’ll do it.’”\n \n\n   \n    Criticism of Richardson’s leadership at FEMA\n \n\n   \n  A former Marine combat veteran, martial arts instructor and  painter,  Richardson previously led the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office at DHS but had no experience managing natural disasters when he was tapped for the FEMA role in May.  His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, also a Trump administration appointee, was fired  for clashing with senior homeland security officials and opposing the administration’s push to eliminate FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  “He never should have been there to begin with,” Hamilton, who worked with Richardson during his time in the administration, told CNN this week. “The two words I’d use to describe him are unprofessional and overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s appointment marked a turning point as DHS tightened its grip on FEMA, installing loyalists in key positions and pushing out veteran disaster experts. Unlike Hamilton, Richardson was seen as someone who would follow orders. He’s a personal friend of longtime Trump ally  Corey Lewandowski, who is helping Noem run DHS  as her chief adviser.\n \n\n   \n  On his first day, Richardson told FEMA staff he alone spoke for the agency and warned he would “run right over” anyone who didn’t fall in line.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials describe his leadership as brash and unpredictable, with a penchant for shouting and swearing. On one occasion, he asked staff whether disaster funds could be steered to Republican areas but not Democratic ones, a FEMA official who heard the comments firsthand said.\n \n\n   \n  At times, Richardson prohibited staff from bringing cell phones and computers into meetings. He often kept his own phone out of sight and rarely used email, leaving senior FEMA leaders struggling to reach him and making even basic communication a constant challenge.\n \n\n   \n  Over the months, Noem and her team had grown frustrated with Richardson’s distracting antics and failure to effectively communicate their FEMA reforms to Congress and the public, three sources with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. But senior leaders ultimately decided it made more sense to wait until after hurricane season to remove him.\n \n\n   \n  The department has steadily reduced his role, treating him more as a liability than an asset. DHS has repeatedly blocked his requests to speak at conventions or to lead public information campaigns about hurricane season, two sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Have you heard him speak?” an administration official told CNN. “He does more damage than good.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, the department has reassigned some of Richardson’s closest allies and surrounded him with senior staff who have further limited his authority.\n \n\n   \n    FEMA’s future at a crossroads\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Richardson’s removal is significant. Once hurricane season ends at the end of the month, the administration is set to fast-track its sweeping transformation of FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  The new FEMA Review Council, which is headed by Noem, will soon deliver its much-anticipated report, outlining recommendations to reshape the agency. As the dust settles, FEMA’s future — and its ability to respond when disaster strikes — hangs in the balance.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, dozens of lawmakers have signed on to a bipartisan bill known as the “FEMA Act” that would remove the agency from DHS and make it independent — a change Noem vehemently opposes, multiple sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Noem have been  overhauling FEMA since taking office  as they vow to shift more responsibility for disaster preparedness, response and recovery onto states. While they once called for the agency’s outright elimination, their tone has shifted in recent months, signaling a dramatic restructuring may be in store. Either way, current and former high-ranking FEMA officials have  warned that growing turmoil at the agency is putting Americans at risk .\n \n\n   \n  More than a quarter of the agency’s full-time staff have left through layoffs and buyouts — including dozens of longtime senior leaders — and morale has plummeted amid frequent public attacks from administration officials, including Noem and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has benefited from the mildest hurricane season in a decade, with no hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the US for the first time since 2015.\n \n\n   \n  “FEMA likely would have failed had there been a major disaster,” a former high-ranking FEMA official told CNN. “Having no big disasters has absolutely played into the Trump narrative that there is no need for FEMA. And it hasn’t allowed the American people to see just how bad they need the agency, since the states just aren’t prepared.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-cleveland-shedeur-sanders-home-break-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00.000Z","title":"Cleveland rookie Shedeur Sanders’ home broken into during NFL debut, AP source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his NFL debut against the Baltimore Ravens on November 17, 2025, Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders discovered that his suburban home had been burglarized while he was playing.

The judge said that Halligan – the only prosecutor to present the case on behalf of the Justice Department – may have misstated the law to the grand jurors in a way that compromised the proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “Here, the procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey,” the judge wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Access to evidence from a previous investigation\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick said the Justice Department accessed old evidence it seized in searches of online accounts from Comey’s friend and then-lawyer Daniel Richman, for a prior leak investigation that didn’t result in charges.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said DOJ did so without a new court-approved search warrant. Nor did investigators take time this year to sift out confidential attorney-client communications when it charged Comey at the end of September, knowing some of that evidence might not be able to be used, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized” from the prior investigation of Richman, Fitzpatrick wrote, “and apparently, in the government’s eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge had said Comey’s defense team should get access to the grand jury records on Monday, but the Justice Department is still trying to challenge that decision and is holding back the records as another trial-court judge looks at the issues. The Justice Department said in a filing on Monday following Fitzpatrick’s ruling that Comey’s attorney-client confidentiality may not even have been breached by investigators, and that Comey shouldn’t be able to reach beyond grand jury secrecy rules at this point of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The court could move fast to resolve the dispute over whether Comey’s team gets access to the grand jury records as soon as this weekend, with little additional ability in a criminal proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “These materials are essential if Mr. Comey is to fully and fairly defend himself in the face of the irregularities that have characterized this investigation from its inception,” Fitzpatrick wrote on Monday. “The Court finds that the institutional concerns for grand jury secrecy are greatly outweighed by Mr. Comey’s right to Due Process.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge called the Justice Department’s decision this fall not to seek a new search warrant that would have been court approved to access the old evidence from Richman “inexplicable” and “highly unusual.” He also noted that it was “foreseeable” Richman’s electronic devices might contain attorney-client communications with Comey, and the department had known this for years, even excluding Comey from its evidence processing years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Later Monday evening, Fitzpatrick’s order that would allow Comey’s defense team to access grand jury records was temporarily paused by the federal judge overseeing the entire case.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have until Wednesday to make their argument over court filings to why the order should be dissolved, the federal judge said. Comey’s attorneys will then have until Friday to reply to the objections prosecutors raise.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also revealed for the first time that an agent had warned others at the FBI about the use of Richman’s data on the same day Comey was indicted in September — just a few days before the window in which the department could bring a case would close.\n \n\n   \n  One of the FBI agents who had been warned of potentially tainted evidence, the judge said, still “proceeded into the grand jury undeterred,” testifying to the grand jurors as the only witness, about evidence from the old searches of Richman.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury presentation\n \n\n   \n  The judge also slammed statements Halligan made to the grand jury, adding that the prosecutor appears to have made a “fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law” regarding Comey’s ability to testify at his own trial and about his legal burdens if he were charged. The exact words Halligan said to the grand jury are redacted in the judge’s opinion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  But Fitzpatrick, who has read the grand jury transcript, said grand jurors seemed to believe Halligan was telling them that Comey would have to answer questions at trial that she couldn’t during the proceeding, where prosecutors privately present the case to the grand jurors. The judge said Halligan implied to the grand jury that Comey may have to testify at his own trial to win his case — even though the Fifth Amendment gives defendants the protection to decline to testify so as not to incriminate themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the judge noted that Halligan suggested to the grand jury the Justice Department had more and better evidence it could use against Comey later at trial, another potentially problematic statement by the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team will be able to ask the court to suppress the use of core evidence in his case or to dismiss charges against him - including because of what Halligan and the FBI agent witness said to the grand jurors by next week.\n \n\n   \n  The case, alleging Comey lied to Congress in 2020 about his interactions with Richman, currently is set to go to trial just after New Year’s Day. A separate judge is weighing whether Halligan has the authority to have secured the indictment against Comey, given that she is not a Senate-confirmed political appointee.\n \n\n   \n    Timing of grand jury hearing\n \n\n   \n  The magistrate judge also raised significant questions about the timing of the grand jury deliberations and two hours for which there is no grand jury transcript, which Halligan has outlined in a sworn statement recently and said tracked with the grand jury’s deliberations, which wouldn’t have been recorded.\n \n\n   \n  “If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury’s vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,” Fitzpatrick also wrote. “If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “Either way, this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment,” Fitzpatrick added.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/trump-mcdonalds-economy-tariffs-rebate-checks-inflation-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump promoted a narrative of economic prosperity during a speech at a McDonald’s franchise summit, claiming the economy is in a 'golden age' with falling prices and affordability.

Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump proclaimed an economic golden age under the Golden Arches. But while he may have a regular guy’s taste in fast food, he’s looking oblivious to the wrenching price pressure haunting millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s never been a time like this,” he declared Monday at a summit of McDonald’s franchise owners in Washington. The president waxed lyrical about his favorite Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and fondly recalled his turn  working the fry station  at one of the fast-food giant’s Pennsylvania restaurants last year.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s overall message was jarring, as he argued the economy was super-sized even while millions struggle to afford the cost of living. “You know, I just might add, this is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He went on, “We are looking at affordability — we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,” including 401Ks.\n \n\n   \n  Citizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they’ve also been punished  by daily costs  and the money in their paychecks  not going as far . And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidate  now in question . Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy — punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald’s in American communities. “Before the sun rises, you’re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There’s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it’s Americana.”\n \n\n   \n  This was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn’t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents’ branding on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The word is affordable,” Trump said. “And affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said ‘affordability, affordability’ and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats in  gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey  this month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.\n \n\n   \n  First, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for most  food ,  housing  and  health care  that are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.\n \n\n   \n  While inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% — far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration — costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation — that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn’t make it feel any easier.\n \n\n   \n  And after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability — and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s lack of answers on those issues — Trump is now suffering the incumbent’s curse. He’s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren’t feeling better, so he’s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.\n \n\n   \n  The statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. “(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who’d prefer the buck didn’t stop with him.\n \n\n   \n    How Trump is trying to ease costs\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He’s trying to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs . He temporarily eliminated  tax on most tips  in his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.\n \n\n   \n  But insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can’t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  It’s going to need more than Trump’s first big political point in his Monday speech: “You are so damn lucky that I won that election.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars and  high tariffs  are contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year.   A  CNN poll this month  found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  Alleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump’s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out  $2000 tariff revenue payments  is one idea — though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn’t fix the damage and added “who knows if they’ll ever come.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials are thinking aloud about  50-year mortgages . This might get people into homes — if there’s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.\n \n\n   \n    Tariffs may be the problem\n \n\n   \n  More fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Friday  cutting duties  on beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” Hassett said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday, said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday. But he added, “The prices will go down,” arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump isn’t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy — which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That’s time Trump doesn’t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. “I blew my stack at these people,”  he told a reporter .\n \n\n   \n  Another complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into a  complete reversal  by calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.\n \n\n   \n  Even one of his top supporters,  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a “golden age” when they know well that it is not won’t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the new  White House ballroom , dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn’t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And his speech at the McDonald’s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword “affordability” a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, as  CNN’s Daniel Dale has documented .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn’t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  But his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he’s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking about  sending him around the country  to give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he’d given a McDonald’s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. “‘I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don’t care.’ But I don’t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren’t too accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  And one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. “I like the fish. I like it,” Trump said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-bengals-chase-suspended-spitting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"Bengals receiver Ja’Marr Chase suspended 1 game by NFL for spitting on Steelers’ Jalen Ramsey","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was suspended without pay for one game by the NFL for allegedly spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey during a game in the fourth quarter.

to reverse course on Epstein files \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  is no longer fighting the release of  the Epstein files . But that doesn’t mean he’s happy about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump threw his support behind a congressional effort to release all the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after it became clear that he could not halt its momentum and that he risked suffering an embarrassing blow on the House floor, people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The stark reality, which was conveyed to Trump by allies and advisers in recent days, drove the president’s abrupt reversal Sunday evening and his comments Monday that he’ll sign the measure if it comes to his desk. It’s a decision he came to reluctantly, but one that is now likely to clear the way for the measure’s overwhelming passage in the House on Tuesday and for the Senate to take it up after that.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure, I would,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Monday when asked whether he’d sign the measure.\n \n\n   \n  It was a rare moment of retreat for a president who has made a habit of bending Washington to his will since returning to office. And it came after the White House privately tried and failed last week to pressure a handful of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support for the measure, and days after Trump attacked those defectors as “soft and foolish.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,” the president wrote in one post on Truth Social. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republicans would fall into that trap.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remains personally frustrated by the continuing focus on the Epstein files, the people familiar with the matter said, viewing them as a distraction from his agenda that Democrats have since co-opted as fodder for political attacks. The president resents being tied to Epstein, who he has said he cut ties with well before Epstein was charged with any crimes, and has been irritated at the central role some of his close allies have played in the campaign for the files, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Just 48 hours before flipping his stance on the Epstein files, Trump attacked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in bitterly personal terms over her strident support for the House measure, withdrawing his endorsement and labeling the Georgia Republican a “traitor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump ultimately shifted his own position after advisers and allies convinced him that the House measure’s passage was inevitable despite his best efforts — and that fighting it was only fueling more attention.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in what one of the people familiar with the matter characterized as a tactical move, Trump and his allies are hoping that backing the speedy passage of the measure will allow Republicans to move past the issue more quickly and give the administration an opening to refocus attention on policy efforts that Trump has complained are going ignored.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll just get this done and move it on,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend. “There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson on Monday suggested he may vote for the measure after months of siding with Trump against it, citing new optimism that the Senate will “be able to correct” some of his concerns over its language.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since adopted that attitude, encouraging Republicans on Monday to shift their focus to areas that are viewed as far more crucial to next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “All I want is I want for people to recognize a great job that I’ve done on pricing, on affordability,” he said. “I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump in the meantime has also sought to turn the Epstein issue against Democrats, ordering a Justice Department investigation of the former financier’s ties to a range of people including former President Bill Clinton and prominent economic adviser  Larry Summers . (Neither has been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and nor has Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the probe as evidence that Trump has wanted “transparency related to the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s announcement has sparked fresh questions about whether the Justice Department could then cite the open investigation in refusing to turn over documents to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that Trump has not ordered the department to stand in the way of any congressional requests, but it’s unclear how it will respond if the House measure is ultimately signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  That consideration, though, is likely weeks away. The Senate is due to break for a Thanksgiving recess at the end of the week, meaning it likely could not take up the measure until December at the earliest. And despite the broad bipartisan support in the House, Senate Majority Leader John Thune remains uncommitted on bringing the Epstein measure to the floor quickly, or even at all, a GOP leadership aide said.\n \n\n   \n  That provides the White House with an opening that allies hope Trump can take advantage of to refocus voters and elevate the far more advantageous elements of his agenda, the people familiar with the matter said — for at least as long as they can keep the Epstein issue at bay.\n \n\n   \n  “It never fully gets tamped … and part of that is just the sheer fact that a conspiracy theory never goes away,” said Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist. “Trump has ways of distracting and turning our attention away, but what’s to say it doesn’t pop up two months down the road or six months down the road?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself alluded to that on Monday when voicing his support for releasing the files.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what we give, it’s never enough,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/saudi-crown-prince-trump-white-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"08:43:00-05:00","title":"Trump Pulling Out All the Stops to Welcome Saudi Crown Prince for First White House Visit Since Khashoggi Killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is planning a major, state-level welcome for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, marking his first visit in over seven years.

Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father,  King Salman . But the crown prince has assumed almost all day-to-day responsibility for ruling the kingdom, and attends summits and other diplomatic engagements as the country’s leader.\n \n\n   \n  On the eve of Prince bin Salman’s first  visit to the White House  in more than seven years, Trump announced that the US would be selling  F-35 fighter jets  to Saudi Arabia — a controversial step that could alter the military balance in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been a great ally,” Trump told reporters. “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom’s de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president’s signature  Abraham Accords  — a longtime goal of the president’s.\n \n\n   \n  “The Abraham Accords will be a part we’re going to be discussing,” Trump said Friday. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.”\n \n\n   \n  The prince last visited Washington in 2018, months before the murder of dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate  in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement. Hanan Elatr Khashoggi,  Khashoggi’s widow , told CNN’s Jim Sciutto of the planned White House meeting: “It’s very painful for me. It will be better if Jamal was here and receiving the crown prince by himself and meet with him and share with him his vision and mission, and all of his ideas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump never entirely cut off ties with the crown prince during his first term, though he wasn’t invited back to the White House. Even Trump’s successor President Joe Biden, who vowed as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights record, visited Riyadh while in office and fist bumped Prince bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  With Tuesday’s visit, any semblance of a rupture in  US-Saudi ties  appears to have disappeared. The plans include a welcome ceremony involving military bands, a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and a black-tie dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  The first tranche of invitations were sent out earlier this month and the guest list includes largely chief executives, as well as lawmakers and governors — some of whom Trump himself called to invite to the dinner, people familiar with the plans said. The event is being coordinated by first lady Melania Trump, as all state visits are planned through the first lady’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to hold a state visit in his second term, which is typically put on as a sign of friendship and to display the close relationship the US shares with its allies, during his second term. Trump broke with tradition during his first administration by opting not to hold a state dinner during his first year in office, though he went on to host the president of France and prime minister of Australia in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit,” a White House official said in a statement to CNN. “We will not get ahead of the President on conversations that are occurring ahead of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is also planning an investment summit to coincide with the crown prince’s trip to Washington. The event at the Kennedy Center, a day after the White House visit, is intended to link up American and Saudi business leaders for financial opportunities.\n \n\n   \n  In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia for the first state visit of his second term and was welcomed with  elaborate pageantry , including a fighter jet escort, an honor guard with golden swords and a fleet of Arabian horses accompanying his limousine. The president has sought to deepen ties to other Gulf states during his tenure, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n \n\n   \n  Before the May stop, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the United States. Trump brought several American executives with him to Riyadh, and signed several agreements. Many have yet to be fully implemented.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s meetings, US and Saudi officials were working to finalize agreements on defense and security cooperation, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Riyadh has long sought the F-35s, one of the most advanced military jets in the world. But Israel — the only country in the Middle East with the jets — is worried about maintaining its military edge. Congress could block export licenses for the F-35s to Saudi Arabia, though it’s unusual.\n \n\n   \n    Discussions about normalizing relations with Israel\n \n\n   \n  Atop Trump’s agenda will be a discussion of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, a step he believes is within reach after he helped broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The October 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel, and the war that followed, largely put on hold the normalization discussions that began during Trump’s first term and advanced during Biden’s. A framework being discussed before the attacks would include a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help building a civilian nuclear program in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Biden and many of his top aides have said they believe the October 7 attack was intended, in part, to obstruct the normalization talks. Now that a ceasefire is in place, Trump believes a deal can be quickly reached.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump told Fox News last month. “I think they’re going to all go in very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some hurdles remain in getting the crown prince on board. While he and Trump are expected to sign a defense cooperation agreement Tuesday, it falls short of the treaty under discussion in earlier phases of normalization discussions, the US official said. A formal treaty would require congressional approval.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia has also said a condition to normalizing ties with Israel is a “credible” and “irreversible” pathway to Palestinian statehood, which the Gaza plan Trump helped broker stops short of providing.\n \n\n   \n  And for Saudi Arabia, another issue is high on the agenda — the stability of Sudan, which it views as critical for its own security, believing that only Trump can stop external support for the civil war there.\n \n\n   \n  But American officials are nonetheless hopeful about making progress on the normalization issue during Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n  One of the architects of the Abraham Accords, Trump’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner , visited Riyadh last week for talks with the crown prince ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, a White House official and a person familiar with the matter said. Kushner has long had a close, personal relationship with the Saudi prince, and has been deployed several times in recent months to use his ties to Mideast leaders to help lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda and build upon the Abraham Accords.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the sensitive dynamic of the visit are Trump’s  personal financial interests in the region . The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. Kushner also has significant business ties to the country. Kushner’s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has raised billions of dollars in capital from Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated on Monday with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-larry-summers-harvard-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:09:00-05:00","title":"Larry Summers Says He Is 'Deeply Ashamed' After New Jeffrey Epstein Emails and Will Pause Public Engagements","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, a prominent former U.S. economic official and Harvard University professor, has publicly admitted to being 'deeply ashamed' over his long-standing personal correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. “While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”\n \n\n   \n  New details of Summers’ relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee  released emails  showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ first statement addressing the newly unveiled Epstein correspondence comes on the heels of Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling on Harvard to sever ties with Summers and putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, had said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers — Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein’s sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation’s politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvard has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning think tank where Summers has been a senior fellow, said Monday night after Summers’ statement: “Larry Summers has announced that he is stepping away from public commitments immediately, and this includes ending his fellowship at CAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country’s most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has  clashed   with Summers   over financial regulations  in the past.\n \n\n   \n  But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represented an even sharper critique of his character.\n \n\n   \n  Summers resigned as Harvard’s president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  The House Oversight Committee released  tens of thousands of pages  of documents on Wednesday that it received from the Epstein estate. Included in the recent trove were numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein between at least 2013 and 2019. Epstein  pleaded guilty  in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.\n \n\n   \n  The messages show the two men frequently bantered about current events, political headlines and high-profile figures in elite orbits — everything from Iran’s nuclear policy to Donald Trump’s first-term decisions in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  In November 2018, for example, Summers seemed to forward an email from a woman to solicit Epstein’s advice on when to write back.\n \n\n   \n  “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. (He happened to ask in the same email whether Epstein believed Trump was “getting crazier” or was “steady crazy.”)\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back in part: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.”\n \n\n   \n  In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers’ continued contact with Epstein  during this period  was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an  exhaustive investigative series  detailing Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges.\n \n\n   \n  Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Why bad form. Supposed to be face to face?” Summers wrote back.\n \n\n   \n  “you care very much for this person. You might want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite,” Epstein wrote back, before appearing to compare the situation to Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ wife, Elisa New, is a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard. The Wall Street Journal  previously reported  that Summers had asked Epstein to donate money to his wife’s nonprofit. The school’s student paper, The Harvard Crimson,  reported on the outrage  among some professors about the emails between Summers and Epstein. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which included numerous comments and discussions about the president, that he is  asking his attorney general , Pam Bondi, to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures and institutions. Among those Trump singled out were Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  The Economic Club of New York announced Monday that it postponed an upcoming event featuring Summers, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The  virtual event , scheduled for Wednesday, was billed as a discussion about “the future of fiscal and monetary policy,” with Summers and an economics professor from Columbia University. But the club said in an email to registered attendees that there had been an “unavoidable change in schedule,” spurring the postponement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if the postponement was influenced by the Epstein revelations, a club spokeswoman reiterated that it was “due to an unavoidable change in schedule.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/indiana-house-cleaner-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"Indiana homeowner charged in fatal shooting of house cleaner who showed up at the wrong door","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 62-year-old Indiana homeowner, Curt Andersen, was charged with voluntary manslaughter for fatally shooting Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, a house cleaner who mistakenly arrived at his front door in Whitestown, Indiana, on November 5, 2025.

But police said that there’s no evidence Rios entered the home before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s attorney, Guy Relford, posted a statement on X saying he was disappointed that prosecutors charged his client. He said Andersen had every reason to believe his actions were justified and the stand-your-ground law clearly protects him.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Andersen’s actions must be evaluated based on the circumstances as he perceived them,” Relford said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood told reporters at a news conference that the decision to charge Andersen wasn’t difficult. Stand-your-ground protections don’t apply because Andersen lacked enough information to know if his actions were reasonable, Eastwood said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said he planned to prove that Andersen couldn’t have reasonably believed he needed to use deadly force, given what he knew at the time.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Commotion at the door’\n \n\n   \n  According to the probable cause statement, Andersen told investigators that he and his wife were asleep in an upstairs bedroom when he heard a “commotion at the door” that grew more intense. He thought someone was using keys or tools on the front door.\n \n\n   \n  Frightened, he went to the top of the stairwell and saw through the home’s windows that two people were outside the front door. He said to himself, “What am I going to do? It’s not going away and I have to do something now.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he loaded his handgun, went back to the windows and saw the people “thrusting” at the door and getting more aggressive, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  He fired one shot toward the door. He said the door never opened and he didn’t announce himself or say anything before he pulled the trigger.\n \n\n   \n  When told he had killed Rios, he put his head down on the table and said he didn’t mean for anything to happen to anybody.\n \n\n   \n    Wife says Andersen told a neighbor he would shoot any intruder\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s wife, Yoshie Andersen, told investigators that her husband told her that he told a neighbor if anyone tried to break into his house he would shoot them. The probable cause statement does not say when this conversation happened.\n \n\n   \n  She added that her husband fired the shot from the top of the stairs and neither of them went downstairs. He fired the shot and then told her to call 911, she said.\n \n\n   \n    No evidence of forcible entry\n \n\n   \n  Investigators found a bullet hole in the door, but no evidence of any forceful contact with the door itself, the latch or the door frame, according to the probable cause statement.\n \n\n   \n  Rios’ husband, Mauricio Velasquez, told investigators that she tried to open the door with keys from their cleaning company, but they unknowingly were at the wrong address. He said they’d been trying to open the door for 30 seconds to a minute before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  He said they never heard any voices from inside or saw any movement. The couple didn’t knock, bang on the door or use force of any kind to enter the home and they never got inside, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground cases elsewhere\n \n\n   \n  The shooting echoes a similar episode in Missouri in 2023 when  an 86-year-old man shot Ralph Yarl  after the 16-year-old Black teenager came to his door by mistake. Missouri has a similar stand-your-ground law, but prosecutors charged the shooter, Andrew Lester, with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and didn’t go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, which does not have a stand-your-ground law, a  man was convicted in 2024 of second-degree murder  for fatally shooting a woman inside a car who mistakenly came down the driveway of his rural upstate home.\n \n\n   \n  Jody Madeira, an Indiana University law professor who specializes in gun rights, said last week that the Rios case was “horrible” and “exceptionally unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  In general, the public can legally access private property — including a front porch — for a legitimate purpose until they are told to leave, Madeira said. For example, a homeowner can’t legally shoot a pizza delivery person or an Amazon driver just for stepping onto their property, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Madeira said Monday that the allegations in the probable cause statement show that Curt Andersen was acting out of fear but that’s not enough to invoke the stand-your-ground law. There was no unlawful entry and trying to insert a key into a lock or rattling a doorknob isn’t a reasonable justification for firing a shot, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The reasonable person says, ‘hey, I have my phone here, I have other options, I can shout a warning. It’s 7 a.m., is someone really breaking into my house? He jumped up from bed and immediately went into I’m combatting a break-in.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/jesse-jackson-moved-from-icu-hospitalized","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"07:22:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to be removed from the ICU but will remain hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 84, is recovering from a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurological disorder affecting movement and balance, and has been moved out of the ICU at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.

federal court California’s ban on  most law enforcement officers from wearing masks during operations , a move the Department of Justice insisted was necessary to protect federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  In a lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California, the Trump administration argued that  California’s law,  signed in September in response to immigration raids over the summer in Los Angeles, was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate federal law enforcement officers.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after months of immigration arrests conducted by masked federal agents who use  aggressive tactics  across the country. California’s ban was slated to go into effect in January next year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted masks are an important precaution taken to maintain the safety of law enforcement officers. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a  press release  Monday that “they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties.”\n \n\n   \n  “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has insisted the ban pushes back against the federal government’s use of masked agents without identification or badge numbers to detain people on the streets during immigration raids.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,” Newsom said at a press conference when he signed the law. “Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today.”\n \n\n   \n  The law, the first of its kind in the United States according to the Associated Press, bars neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers who are conducting official business. There are exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks and tactical gear. The ban does not apply to state police.\n \n\n   \n  Currently, there is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Historically, officers have almost always concealed their faces only while performing undercover work to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, law enforcement experts  have told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  The practice of hiding of agents’ faces, badges and identifying uniforms has made it difficult for members of the public to know whether the immigration arrests over the past several months are legitimate. John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told CNN in August that it was “incredibly dangerous” for the officers to make arrests without clearly identifying themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is really obvious, right? You’re sitting there and all of a sudden a bunch of masked men run out and are grabbing someone on the street,” he said on the  CNN One Thing  podcast. “There are good, well-intentioned bystanders who might think that they need to step in and help and that they’re witnessing a kidnapping.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Levenson and Josh Campbell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/venezuela-cartel-de-los-soles-fto-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"Is the US targeting a Venezuelan cartel that may not technically exist?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has proposed designating Cartel de los Soles—a loosely connected network of Venezuelan military officials involved in drug trafficking—as a foreign terrorist organization, despite experts and former government officials arguing it lacks the structure and ideology of a traditional cartel and may not technically exist.

\nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Trump administration ramps up the pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, experts and former government officials have raised concerns about its  move to designate Cartel de los Soles  as a foreign terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  They argue it is not a formally organized cartel similar to criminal organizations in Colombia and Mexico, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  They suggested the designation provides the administration a justification to take military action against the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said as much on Sunday, telling reporters that the designation could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about Cartel de los Soles\n \n\n   \n  Cartel de los Soles, which means cartel of the suns in English, is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, say experts.\n \n\n   \n  But given its lack of hierarchy and structure, some say it can’t be compared to traditional cartels that have been designated as terror groups by the US, and others suggest it technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re designating a non-thing that is not a terror organization as a terrorist organization,” said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  Another former senior US government official said Cartel de los Soles was “a made-up name used to describe an ad hoc group of Venezuelan officials involved in the trafficking of drugs through Venezuela. It doesn’t have the hierarchy or command-and-control structure of a traditional cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  The official said the Trump administration’s assertions are based on “bad intel” likely from the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny before the greater intelligence community, or that “it is purely political.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DIA and DEA for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The name emerged in the 1990s, after Venezuelan generals and commanders – who wore sun insignias on their epaulettes – were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes, according to the think tank  InsightCrime .\n \n\n   \n  The name caught on and was frequently used, especially from the mid-2000s onward, when several members of different branches of the military assumed more active roles in drug trafficking, InsightCrime said in a recent report.\n \n\n   \n  Jeremy McDermott, cofounder and co-director of InsightCrime, told CNN that the so-called cartel “is not a traditional, vertically organized drug trafficking organization. It is, at least according to InsightCrime, a series of normally disconnected cells embedded within the Venezuelan military.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the  State Department , Cartel de los Soles, along with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal organization and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, are responsible for drug trafficking to the United States and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas,  previously told CNN  that “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t mean that there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking. “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” the expert said.\n \n\n   \n  For Gunson, Maduro’s role is reminiscent of that of former Panamanian President Manuel  Noriega , who was sentenced to decades in prison in various jurisdictions for his association with the Medellín cartel in 1992: an external partner who, while not directly part of a cartel, still benefited from drug trafficking routes under his protection.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel.\n \n\n   \n  “Suddenly, they (the US) dusted off something they call the Cartel de los Soles, which they have never been able to prove, because it doesn’t exist. It’s the narrative of imperialism,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said a few days ago.\n \n\n   \n  CNN contacted the Venezuelan Attorney General’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What is the purpose of the designation?\n \n\n   \n  The foreign terrorist organization (FTO) designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the move could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela, as Trump has suggested.\n \n\n   \n  The US has traditionally treated counternarcotics work as a law enforcement matter, but Trump has increasingly sought to militarize those efforts, using traditional counterterrorism tools and authorities – something that Finucane said is really a smokescreen for the operation’s true purpose: to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “The concerning aspect of this move is that it could be a prelude to military action against the Venezuelan government itself,” Finucane said, calling it another step in Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s “efforts to cloak a regime change operation in the guise of counternarcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration, he said, is “inventing a fact pattern” and “creating an alternate reality” in order to be able to publicly characterize its policy toward Venezuela as a counterterrorism campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Although designating a foreign organization as a terror organization carries no legal authority for military strikes – it technically only authorizes financial and diplomatic penalties, such as the freezing of assets – the administration has nevertheless used it as a precursor to military action in the recent past. The US military has struck 22 small boats that the administration claims were manned by criminal gangs that it designated as foreign terror organizations.\n \n\n   \n  Those designations have drawn scrutiny from legal experts because some of the gangs and cartels the US has designated are motivated by profit, not ideology. Terror groups, traditionally, have been defined as groups carrying out political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Designating Cartel de los Soles, which may not even be a formal organization, takes that already-contested logic a step further. “They’re basically operating outside of the law which is why there is no limiting principle,” Finucane said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/hongkong-soccer-stadium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-20:50","title":"Hong Kong Soccer Team Draws Near 50,000 Fans in Historic Surge at New Stadium","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hong Kong’s soccer team, long ranked 148th in the world and historically underserved by fan engagement, is experiencing a dramatic resurgence thanks to the opening of the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park.

Legge, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a steamy Tuesday night in June, 42,570 Hongkongers packed into a spectacular new harborside stadium located in their city’s urban heart.\n \n\n   \n   Built on the site of a former airport , the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park was completed this March – and has been the crucible of a resurgence in support for the local team, where a red sea of fans now regularly cheers on the players.\n \n\n   \n  Ranked 148th in the world – just between Ethiopia and the Solomon Islands – Hong Kong’s soccer team has never seen home crowds of this size, with attendances even for crucial qualifiers normally under 15,000.\n \n\n   \n  But recent games have pulled in audiences more like those at top-tier international matches.\n \n\n   \n  “We never had this many fans watching the Hong Kong team,” said Shinichi Chan, the 23-year-old rising star who is a regular starter of the team. “The stadium is becoming our new home.”\n \n\n   \n  Chester Cheung was among the crowd on June 10, a day he won’t forget. That night, Hong Kong defeated India 1-0 in the Asian Cup qualifiers – a series of matches deciding which teams go to the continent’s showpiece event in Saudi Arabia in 2027. For Cheung, a core member of a Hong Kong fan group, watching the team’s debut at the brand-new stadium was “a dream come true.”\n \n\n   \n  “I cried,” said the 29-year-old, who spent two to three months preparing for the game with his organization Chisinlo, named after a Cantonese phrase meaning “crazy people”.\n \n\n   \n  Arriving three to four hours before the game, Cheung and his mates from the group prepared flags, drums, megaphones, banners, and face-painting stickers. They also helped display a huge tifo, which they had a hand in designing.\n \n\n   \n  The fans’ energy set the stage for the players.\n \n\n   \n  “Wearing the Hong Kong team jersey, walking out of the tunnel, and seeing all the fans supporting Hong Kong is such an unbelievable feeling,” recalled Chan, who played midfielder at the game against India. “It is always going to be in my mind and push me ever harder to play better football.”\n \n\n   \n  The momentum rolled into to the next home game, where more than 45,000 fans filled the stands - a new record for the team - during a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh last month.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung said the team’s debut at Kai Tak was “a very good entry point” for those who had not watched much soccer before, as many of them were attracted by social media videos of that game and decided to give the following games a try.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday, Hong Kong will face Singapore at its third home game at Kai Tak, and tickets are already sold out.\n \n\n   \n  The packed stands should come as little surprise in a city with a rich soccer tradition going back to its time as a British colony.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s first professional league was established as early as 1908, one of the oldest in Asia. It flourished in the 1970s and 80s, but since then has lost fans lured by globalized European leagues, in particular the English Premier League.\n \n\n   \n  The team’s more hardcore fans in the past have also been outspoken supporters of Hong Kong’s unique Cantonese identity, culture and language, something that has occasionally caused political frictions with local authorities. Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to China in 1997 under an agreement where it is meant to keep a level of autonomy for 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  In the years leading up to the massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019, China’s national anthem was  frequently greeted with jeers and boos  from supporters of the local team.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong authorities have since  made it illegal  to show disrespect to the national anthem, silencing the jeering in the stands as such public act of defiance could now lead to fines and lengthy imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n    New stadium\n \n\n   \n  In addition to serving as the home stadium for the city’s soccer team, the Kai Tak Sports Park is central to Hong Kong’s bid to reclaim its status as Asia’s premier destination for mega-events, after losing out to rival cities like Singapore and Tokyo in attracting some of the world’s biggest stars.\n \n\n   \n  And the progress is already noticeable. Since April, the sprawling waterfront complex has hosted performers from the rock band Coldplay to Asian pop stars JJ Lin and Jay Chou, as well as major sport events including  Rugby Sevens  and English soccer’s  North London Derby .\n \n\n   \n  But for Cheung, who has followed the Hong Kong soccer team at different home venues for 10 years, the best part about Kai Tak Sports Park is the air conditioning – not to be sniffed at in a subtropical city of swelteringly humid summers.\n \n\n   \n  “So no matter the weather, no matter how hot it is, it is still very comfortable inside, ” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Hong Kong seeing large fan-bases for teams that are far from the top of international rankings.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer across Southeast Asia has been drawing bigger crowds in recent years. Countries and regions are putting more efforts into naturalizing foreign players and cultivating young talents, which has helped boost their competitiveness on the Asian stage.\n \n\n   \n  The international nature of Hong Kong is also reflected in the team’s ethnic diversity.\n \n\n   \n  It now blends a growing group of naturalized players, including Brazil-born striker Everton Camargo and France-born winger Raphaël Merkies, with a core of local talent thriving in mainland China’s top-tier league. Chan is among them, now in his second impressive season with Shanghai Shenhua after helping the top Chinese club lift last year’s league title.\n \n\n   \n  Both fans and players are ready for the do-or-die game against Singapore Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect a great atmosphere, and every (fan) will spend 120% of their efforts in cheering and supporting the team,” said Cheung, who will be in the stadium with the fan group. “We are telling the fans that this time is not for entertainment. It is a fight. It’s a war.”\n \n\n   \n  For Chan and his teammates, victory is the only goal, with a spot in Saudi Arabia still up for grabs.\n \n\n   \n  “Kai Tak is giving me this feeling that we are stepping forward together as Hong Kong football, with the better venue, to play and provide better experiences for the fans,” said Chan. “And hopefully, we can create something great together.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/asia/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-verdict-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:57:00-05:00","title":"Bangladesh’s Ousted Leader Sheikh Hasina Sentenced to Death After Crimes Against Humanity Conviction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has been sentenced to death by the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) for crimes against humanity, including inciting the violent suppression of student protests in 2024 that resulted in up to 1,400 deaths.

She was not present at the court in Dhaka.\n \n\n   \n  The former prime minister faced five charges primarily related to inciting the murder of the protestors, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest. She has long denied the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The courtroom, where some victims’ families were present, burst into applause as the judges delivered their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheikh Hasina committed crimes against humanity by her incitement, order and failure to take punitive measures,” one of the judges said as he delivered the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  It was “crystal clear” that she “expressed her incitement to the activists of her party … and furthermore, she expressed that she ordered to kill and eliminate the protesting students,” the judges said.\n \n\n   \n  For a nation still reeling from the popular revolt that ousted her, the verdict represents a stunning culmination. For many, it offers judicial validation for an uprising fueled by years of simmering anger against the creeping authoritarianism that defined her long rule.\n \n\n   \n  The verdict’s impact is also being felt in New Delhi. Bangladesh’s interim government has formally demanded the extradition of its former leader, but India has so far remained silent on the request.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi on Monday said it will “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a close neighbour, India remains committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  What began as peaceful student demonstrations over civil service job quotas transformed into a nationwide push for Hasina’s resignation. The turning point was a government crackdown that may have killed up to 1,400 people,  according to  the UN’s human rights office (OHCHR). Up to 25,000 were also injured, the court heard.\n \n\n   \n  The UN declared the verdict on Monday as an “important moment for victims” but cautioned that rights advocates “regret the imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  “While we were not privy to the conduct of this trial, we have consistently advocated for all accountability proceedings – especially on charges of international crimes – to unquestionably meet international standards of due process and fair trial,” OHCHR spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  Hasina slammed the “biased and politically motivated” tribunal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement shared by her Awami League party on social media, following the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  “I reject the ICT’s other allegations of human rights abuses as equally unevidenced. I am very proud of my government’s record on human rights and development,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina ruled the South Asian nation with an iron-fist from 2009 until her ouster in 2024. Now, analysts fear the verdict on Monday could set off a wave of political chaos ahead of national elections expected in February next year.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, her lawyers submitted an appeal to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions over “serious concerns about the lack of fair trial rights and due process.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, government officials in Dhaka called on the Indian government to “hand over these two sentenced individuals to Bangladesh authorities without delay.” “This is India’s responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the Bangladeshi foreign ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Break it down and burn it’\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of protesters descended on the crumbled residence of Hasina’s father – former Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – in Dhanmondi neighborhood, central Bangladesh, before the verdict on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Footage from local media showed demonstrators – who arrived with two bulldozers – lighting the street on fire. Some chanted, “Break it down and burn it,” referring to the Hasina family’s dynastic grip on power. Army and police forces hurled batons at them, video showed.\n \n\n   \n  Others received the verdict as a call for celebration, with students at the prestigious Dhaka University organizing a rally and distributing sweets.\n \n\n   \n  It came after violence erupted in the capital Dhaka on Sunday, with several Molotov cocktails exploding after being thrown by people on bikes, police said.\n \n\n   \n  Security had been tightened, with armored vehicles and officers with riot shields placed around the courthouse, and police, border guard and rapid action teams deployed near key government buildings.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s son on Sunday told Reuters that supporters of her party would block next year’s elections if a ban on her party was not lifted, warning that protests could become violent.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” he said. “Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes. Unless the international community does something, eventually there’s probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections … there’s going to be confrontations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s political journey is a story of tragedy, exile and power, inextricably linked to the history of her home country itself. Under her stewardship, Bangladesh was ushered into an era of significant economic development albeit alongside accusations of corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and human rights abuses.\n \n\n   \n    A life in politics\n \n\n   \n  The eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh, she was thrust into politics early in life as she witnessed the struggle for Bengali autonomy from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  Following a 1975 military coup in which her father, mother, and three brothers were assassinated, Hasina and her sister were forced into exile. She returned to Bangladesh in 1981 to lead her father’s Awami League, and after years of political opposition, first became Prime Minister when the party won the 1996 election.\n \n\n   \n  She served for one term and later returned to power in 2008, ruling Bangladesh with her Awami League until last year.\n \n\n   \n  Bangladesh had seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n \n\n   \n  During her time in power, rights groups say the government used its cyber security law to crack down on freedom of expression online, arresting journalists, artists and activists, with reported cases of arbitrary detention and torture.\n \n\n   \n  But Hasina managed to weather many previous protests against her rule.\n \n\n   \n  That changed last year with the successful Gen Z-led revolution that toppled her.\n \n\n   \n  Many of her family members, along with prominent party leaders and former ministers from her administration have also fled Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of Hasina dismiss the legal proceedings as politically motivated and designed to remove her from the political arena. The Awami League party has been banned from political activities while the trials against Hasina and party leaders continues.\n \n\n   \n  The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, asserts that these trials are an essential step toward restoring accountability and rebuilding public trust in the nation’s democratic institutions.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/john-beam-coach-shooting-cedric-irving-jr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:22:00-05:00","title":"Man Charged with Murder in Shooting of Oakland Football Coach and 'Last Chance U' Star John Beam","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 27-year-old man, Cedric Irving, was charged with murdering John Beam, a celebrated former football coach and 'Last Chance U' star, who was shot in the head at Laney College in Oakland.

to life if convicted, said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson at a Monday press conference. Irving also faces enhancement charges alleging he personally fired a gun that caused great bodily injury and that the victim was particularly vulnerable, possibly due to age, according to the charging complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Beam, 66, was a giant in the local community, a father figure who forged deep relationships with his players while fielding a team that regularly competed for championships. The Netflix docuseries “Last Chance U” focused on Beam and the Laney Eagles in its 2020 season. He’d most recently been serving as the school’s athletic director after retiring from coaching last year.\n \n\n   \n  “He really is the best of Oakland — was the best of Oakland,” Jones Dickson said. “His spirit is still here.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney said Irving had no criminal record.

The student is in stable condition and two juveniles were in custody.\n \n\n   \n  Jones Dickson said Skyline students were on a field trip at Laney College and had to suffer through two lockdowns in the same week.

against her stem from ‘illegal and unethical behavior’ by Trump administration \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James says the Trump administration engaged in “outrageous” conduct to overcome hurdles to bring the mortgage fraud case against her and urged a judge to throw out the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers point to the collective actions of President Donald Trump; Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who made the criminal referral to the Justice Department; Attorney General Pam Bondi;  Lindsey Halligan , the US attorney who brought the case; and Ed Martin, the special attorney in charge of mortgage fraud cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This indictment is the product of months of illegal and unethical behavior by government officials, only made possible by the misuse of a federal agency, the disregard of exculpatory evidence, the systematic removal of ethics officials and career prosecutors who stood in the way, and the improper attempt to install an unqualified U.S. Attorney with nothing to offer except undying loyalty,” lawyers for James  wrote in a motion Monday  to dismiss the case.\n \n\n   \n  “If this brazen, continuous disregard for the law and the Constitution is not outrageous government conduct, nothing is,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The motion, which is a long shot, is one of several legal maneuvers James’ lawyers have launched to try to get the charges dismissed. The indictment alleges she misled a lender when she obtained a mortgage in 2020 on a property in Norfolk, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  James  has previously argued  the charges should be thrown out on the basis that the case is the result of vindictive and selective prosecution and that Halligan is serving unlawfully as US attorney. She is also asking the judge to provide her with material from the grand jury presentation, including whether any exculpatory evidence was presented. Prosecutors have not yet responded to the filings.\n \n\n   \n  James has  pleaded not guilty , and a trial is scheduled for January.\n \n\n   \n  In the latest filing, James’ lawyers raised questions about the source of material for Pulte’s referral, suggesting he may have improperly accessed loan files from Fannie Mae’s database. Citing media reports, the lawyers say Pulte fired officials from the FHFA inspector general’s office who were looking into whether he followed internal procedures.\n \n\n   \n  They also highlighted internal messages between investigators at Fannie Mae to support their claim. In one message, dated June 13, 2025, the Fannie Mae director of mortgage fraud investigations told an associate: “the LJ case is certainly not clear and convincing evidence” of fraud,” according to the court filing. The associate responds, “director asking how we know that the [niece] has lived there since oct 2020,” which James’ lawyers say is “clearly demonstrating Director Pulte’s intimate and direct involvement in the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James is accused of falsely stating she would use the property as a second home. Prosecutors allege she rented out the property and benefited from lower interest rates by receiving a mortgage for a second home instead of an investment property. People familiar with the arrangement say James’ grandniece has lived in the property since it was purchased and has never paid rent.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, James’ lawyers’ argued, played a hands-on role and sent additional information, including a financial calculation of interest rate differences, to Martin and Halligan, who was named US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after  her predecessor refused  to bring a case against James.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Pulte, James’ lawyers say Martin’s conduct violated professional rules and DOJ policy by suggesting if James resigned the investigation would be dropped. They also said when Martin  posed for photos  outside of James’ Brooklyn home, it was an act of intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  “The charges she now faces are inextricably linked to the government’s illegal and unethical investigatory techniques,” James’ lawyers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge doesn’t dismiss the indictment, James’ lawyers are asking for additional communication between Trump, Bondi, Halligan, Martin and Pulte, as well as their staff.\n \n\n   \n  Based on some information they have already received, her lawyers wrote, “over 100 pages of discovery likely turned over by the former FHFA acting inspector general has not been produced.”\n \n\n   \n    Asks for grand jury records\n \n\n   \n  James’ team on Monday also asked the court to order prosecutors to  turn over documents related to the grand jury  in Alexandria, Virginia, that approved the charges against her in October, as well as one empaneled in Norfolk this summer as the Justice Department was investigating her.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan ultimately asked only the Alexandria grand jury to vote on the charges, something James’ attorneys described as a “unique set of circumstances” that warranted their right to sift through a trove of documents they don’t have access to in order to “assess whether the grand jury that brought the indictment was selected, presented to and instructed properly.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the materials James’ team wants access to are documents concerning how the jurors in Alexandria were screened, statements Halligan made to the jurors in Alexandria, and whether certain information provided to the Norfolk grand jury — including potentially exculpatory facts — was also given to the jurors who were asked to vote on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the investigation has said James’ grandniece testified before the Norfolk grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “The need for disclosing the narrow set of grand jury materials being requested is high,” James’ lawyers wrote in court papers, acknowledging the fact that the documents sought are ordinarily kept under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  A similar fight over grand jury records in James Comey’s criminal case has been underway in recent weeks. A judge has ordered prosecutors in the former FBI director’s case to hand over all grand jury materials to Comey’s team, but the government is trying to stop that decision.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine-gavi-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:24:00Z","title":"US funding cuts imperil global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The global effort to eliminate cervical cancer is facing a crisis due to unexpected US funding cuts to Gavi, the public-private partnership driving HPV vaccination in low-income countries.

And he made sure two of his daughters, including the youngest child of his late wife, were among the first to be protected.\n \n\n   \n  “More than any other person, I was so excited when I heard about the vaccine,” said Modu, who has 10 children.\n \n\n   \n  “I was so happy that they were safe,” he said. “It reminds me of the lost glory of my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  His daughters were among 86 million girls vaccinated as part of a campaign led by Gavi, a public-private partnership that works with government health systems in lower-income countries to protect children and adolescents against   more than 20 infectious diseases. Seventy-three million of those girls were vaccinated in just the past three years, most of them in Africa and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Its HPV vaccination program is a key piece of the World Health Organization’s  global strategy  to put cervical cancer on a path to elimination, following diseases like measles, polio and smallpox. But the pace of its progress against HPV and cervical cancer is now under threat after unexpected funding cuts by the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi set an ambitious target to dramatically scale up its HPV vaccine program in 2023. On Monday, the organization announced that it had met its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanks to incredible commitment from countries, partners, civil society and communities, we have now reached that target ahead of schedule,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s CEO. “This collaborative effort is driving major global progress towards eliminating one of the deadliest diseases affecting women.”\n \n\n   \n  But the celebration is taking place under a heavy shadow. In June, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stunned health officials when, in a video address to world leaders gathered to pledge funding to Gavi, he said the US was pulling all financial support until the organization could “re-earn the public’s trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has repeatedly  targeted the US vaccine system  since taking office, praised Gavi’s commitment to “making medicine affordable to all the world’s people” but criticized   its messaging about vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Gavi’s handling of vaccine safety issues.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi issued a  detailed statement  in response to Kennedy’s claims, defending its commitment to children’s health and use of independent WHO experts, noting that it “remains committed to continuing an evidence-based and scientific approach to its work and investment decisions, as it always has done.” It has continued to engage with the US government on restoring funding in the months since, a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s budget comes from national governments and private funders, including philanthropies, corporations and individual donors, with the US having been – until recently – one of its largest supporters. Since its founding in 2000, the organization has helped immunize over 1.2 billion children in 78 lower-income countries, efforts that have prevented an estimated 20.6 million deaths.\n \n\n   \n  No country had ever withdrawn a financial commitment to Gavi, according to the organization. The US provided about 13% of its funding. If that isn’t restored, combined with other reduced pledges, Gavi will be left with a nearly $3 billion shortfall – approximately a quarter of its expected budget. That could force a significant scaling back of the anti-cancer campaign when Gavi’s board meets next month.\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccination remains a top priority for Gavi, a spokesperson said, but financial pressure might affect how it expands coverage. “Difficult decisions will need to be made on deploying resources to areas of highest health impact.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about its stance on Gavi, HHS referred to its statement issued when Kennedy announced the pause in funding, which said “the concern is that when vaccine safety issues have come before GAVI, it has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency did not address questions about what specifically   Gavi can do to re-earn public trust in the eyes of the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The millions of HPV vaccines Gavi has given will save lives, said Dr. Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. “But there’s going to be new children and adolescents that are going to be eligible to get vaccinated every year. And having cuts to Gavi’s support is potentially going to reduce the access to vaccines in these settings.”\n \n\n   \n    A cancer-preventing vaccine\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccines protect against a family of viruses that cause 4% of cancers globally, the most common of which is cervical cancer, the fourth deadliest cancer for women. Depending on the formulation of the vaccine, they prevent infections that cause between 70% and 90% of all cervical cancer cases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a remarkable vaccine,” said Dr. Jessica Kahn, professor of pediatrics and senior associate dean of clinical and translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who noted that it also prevents infections that cause anal, vaginal, vulvar, and head and neck cancers. “It has the potential to have a truly transformative impact on cancers around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Introduced in 2006, the vaccine is only the second widely used vaccine that prevents cancer; the other prevents hepatitis B infections, a major cause of liver cancer. The HPV vaccine is typically given before the beginning of sexual activity, generally recommended for girls ages 9 to 14 in a two- or three-dose regimen. Its dramatic impact is becoming more obvious as the first women to receive the vaccine reach their 30s, 40s and 50s, when cervical cancer typically appears.\n \n\n   \n  “The HPV vaccine is probably one of the most effective vaccines that we have out there, and we’re constantly getting new data in on that, as the vaccine has been used for a longer period of time,” said Bednarczyk, who studies HPV vaccination. “The research really shows us that we have a very, very good tool for reducing the amount of cervical cancer and really decreasing that burden globally.”\n \n\n   \n  But for years, the vaccine was mostly available in wealthy countries, such as the United States and European nations. Further decreasing the cervical cancer burden means vaccinating school-age girls in places where cases and deaths are highest: low- and middle-income countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That requires a lot of investment, Bednarczyk says. “HPV vaccines are some of the more expensive vaccines that we have out there. That’s really where Gavi comes in.”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2010s, Gavi began piloting school-based vaccination programs. But demand soon outpaced HPV vaccine supply, leading to shortages. The organization spent years negotiating purchasing agreements with vaccine manufacturers on behalf of the 57 lower-income countries it supports.\n \n\n   \n  All the pieces were in place at the end of 2022, when a big opportunity arose to reduce cost and simplify the HPV vaccination process: WHO issued guidance that said a single dose of the vaccine confers effective protection. Gavi was ready, said Emily Kobayashi, head of Gavi’s HPV Vaccines Programme.\n \n\n   \n  “That single-dose recommendation from WHO, based on the building evidence, meant that the supply we had could go much further,” she said. “And it was easier to deliver the vaccine to girls once, rather than having to track them down and give them their second or third dose.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi quickly directed $600 million to the “revitalisation” of its HPV vaccination program, supporting countries on vaccine acquisition, investments in health systems to improve HPV vaccine delivery, and integrating HPV vaccination into routine immunisation. In 2023 alone, it helped vaccinate 14 million girls – more than in the previous eight years combined.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Game-changer’\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria, Modu’s home, was one of the first countries to launch a single-dose HPV immunization program with Gavi. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria has a cervical cancer rate that’s four times higher than in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I was amazed when the federal government announced the introduction of HPV into immunization,” Modu said. “I mobilized my community together – my family and everybody to receive this vaccination.”\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, the country has immunized more than 13 million girls, the largest share of Gavi’s 86 million total. Nigeria is among 49 countries that have introduced HPV vaccination with Gavi support. Another seven are on track to launch programs before mid-2026, according to the organization, some of them before the end of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  By January, Gavi estimates that HPV vaccines will be available in countries that have 89% of the world’s cervical cancer burden, up from 10% a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is definitely a game-changer for HPV vaccination and access to the HPV vaccine,” Kobayashi said. “Cervical cancer is one of the most painful and undignified ways to die, and it’s almost completely preventable by one shot in childhood. … It’s going from a vaccine that’s only available in a small number of places to something that’s widely available, including in lower-income countries.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s current plans call for more than doubling the number of girls it has vaccinated against HPV in the next five years and continuing to expand access to more countries with high rates of cervical cancer. The goal is to vaccinate 120 million girls from 2026 to   2030. The organization spent the past year appealing to donors to fully fund its campaign to do so, which it estimates would save 1.5 million lives.\n \n\n   \n    Paused\n \n\n   \n  But in the wake of Kennedy’s stunning announcement, these ambitious goals are now in question.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi plans its work on five-year cycles, securing pledges from its major funders in advance. Since the organization was founded, the US has been among the largest funders, exceeded only by the United Kingdom and the Gates Foundation. During the Biden administration, it pledged $1.58 billion to Gavi for 2025-30, what was set to be its largest contribution yet.\n \n\n   \n  US commitments to Gavi were uninterrupted during the first Trump administration, with Trump recommitting the US pledge in 2020, but things were different almost immediately when the new administration began this year. Funding for Gavi was  abruptly paused  during the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and remains in limbo.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to engage with the U.S. and hope we can sustain the strong partnership that has endured since Gavi’s founding,” the Gavi spokesperson said. “While we have incredible bipartisan support in Congress and across U.S. Administrations, including President Trump’s robust pledge at the 2020 replenishment, this is the first time we’ve seen a committed pledge walked back.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the executive branch makes the country’s financial pledges to the organization, it’s Congress that sets the annual funding level to be distributed to Gavi. For the 2026 fiscal year, a House committee approved $300 million for Gavi, while its Senate counterpart has not yet released a State and Foreign appropriations bill. Meanwhile, Gavi has not received the $300 million Congress appropriated in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in September.\n \n\n   \n  In a response to questions about who would make the ultimate decision about releasing allocated funds, a State Department spokesperson said in an email, “The U.S. government speaks with one voice for all America First foreign policy programming,” adding that “The State Department collaborates closely with [other agencies] to implement assistance consistent with Trump Administration priorities. … The State Department has notified Gavi that the American taxpayer’s money must deliver better on the United States’ global health goals.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s announcement came on the heels of other Trump administration shakeups pulling back from global health initiatives, including  withdrawing from WHO  and dismantling the  US Agency for International Development .\n \n\n   \n  As those shakeups reverberated across the global health field, Gavi saw other funders partially scale back expected contributions. And vaccine experts worry that US actions will not just limit budgets but erode trust in vaccines as well.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s long history of criticizing vaccine programs – often with false and misleading claims – includes helping organize  a lawsuit  against the makers of Gardasil, the first HPV vaccine, alleging that drugmaker   Merck overstated its safety (Merck has previously said the litigation has no merit). The potential fees Kennedy would collect from the case while in office became a point of contention in his confirmation hearing, before he ultimately said he would  divest from the case.  The next month, the parties agreed to  postpone the case  until February 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate legal action in March, a federal judge ruled in Merck’s favor, dismissing more than 200 cases that similarly challenged the safety of the vaccine.\n \n\n   \n  “There are headwinds there because of vaccine disinformation and misinformation,” said Kahn, who has served on the WHO HPV Vaccine Advisory Committee and has been studying HPV vaccine effectiveness since 2006. “But this is one of the safest vaccines ever tested,” she said, citing more than 100 safety studies of 2.5 million people in six countries, which have shown no serious side effects of HPV vaccination beyond the rare allergic reactions typical for all vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “If we wanted to eliminate cervical cancer globally, we could,” said Kahn, who considers the WHO cervical cancer goals ambitious but “achievable with the right political will.”\n \n\n   \n  Those goals set a target of 90% of girls under 15 vaccinated against HPV by 2030, along with screening and treatment targets for adult women.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got these tools, we’ve got these systems to be able to prevent these cancers, but we actually need to be able to use them. And to use them, we need these concerted efforts to make sure that there is good and equitable access to these vaccines,” Bednarczyk said. “So all of these missed opportunities that we have today due to these funding cuts are potentially leaving generations of individuals more susceptible to these cancers.”\n \n\n   \n  A few countries, including the Netherlands, Brazil and Hungary, have increased financial commitments to Gavi in recent months, and the organization expects to announce several others by the end of the year. But those contributions so far total less than $200 million of the nearly $3 billion budget hole. Gavi’s leadership will be making decisions on how to use the funding it does have at a board meeting in December and finalizing them by the summer.\n \n\n   \n  “Our leadership and Board are looking at ways in which cuts can be applied to Gavi programmes while having as little impact as possible on children’s health. At the same time, Gavi continues to fundraise,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  The organization will continue to support countries in the process of launching HPV vaccination programs, some using remaining 2025 funds, and those now doing routine HPV vaccination, like Nigeria. As girls there reach their 9th birthdays, they’ll be able to get Gavi-supplied vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Those include two more of Maina Modu’s children. Modu retired from his immunization officer job last month at age 56 but continues to campaign for cervical cancer vaccination, sharing his family’s story to encourage members of his community to vaccinate their daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Cervical cancer is a very dangerous and killer disease, and I learned that from my late wife,” he said. “That’s what makes me take it upon myself to make sure that I immunize them and ask others to emulate this.”\n \n\n   \n  Another of Maina Modu’s daughters turns 9 in January. He plans to take her straight to their local health clinic for her HPV vaccine.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/soccer-trump-world-cup-host-cities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:17:00-04:00","title":"Trump Muses About Stripping US World Cup Host Cities of Games Just Months Before Tournament Kicks Off","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate World Cup 2026 games from U.S. host cities—such as Los Angeles and Boston—on the grounds of high crime, poor local governance, or lack of cooperation from Democratic leaders.

\nUpdated: \n        4:17 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump issued a veiled threat to Democratic-run cities slated to host  World Cup  matches next year, saying he might ask FIFA to move games from certain cities if he feels crime is too high or local leadership isn’t cooperating with the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking in the Oval Office with FIFA president  Gianni Infantino  by his side, Trump was asked what it would take for World Cup games to be taken away from host cities, as he has previously threatened.\n \n\n   \n  “The governors are going to have to behave. The mayors are going to have to behave,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the case of California, you have a problem. You have high crime and you have a place that just suffered great fires and everything else, and they didn’t do a very good job. … So, here’s the story. I love Los Angeles. If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary to help them. I want it to be great. I’d love it to be in Los Angeles. I love the place. It’s a natural for Los Angeles.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “If we think there’s going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the governor – and maybe he won’t obstruct, maybe it’ll be great. But I’d love for him to call and say, ‘You know, we’d like to have some extra (help)’ because if there’s even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before the problem occurs.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump last month threatened to pull World Cup games  from Boston after mentioning his displeasure  with that city’s Democratic mayor, Michelle Wu.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for specifics on Monday about what it would take for him to try and move matches from host cities, Trump was vague.\n \n\n   \n  “If we think there’s going to be any sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city,” he said. “We have a lot of cities that would love to have it, No. 1, and we’ll do it very safely.”\n \n\n   \n  Reporters asked the president about his threats to pull games and – in an extraordinary moment – turned to Infantino, saying, “But if we think there’s going to be a problem, Gianni, can I say we will move?”\n \n\n   \n  The FIFA president, who has developed a tight relationship with Trump in recent years, declined to enthusiastically back the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “Safety and security is the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup,” Infantino said in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see today that people have trust in the United States. … They know that they will be coming here, and they will experience a safe and secure World Cup. This is the responsibility, of course, of the government, of (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem, of everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “And obviously we will, I mean, we will discuss. We are working together. We have a task force for this, and we must ensure that all fans coming from abroad or being here – they can experience a celebration of coming together, of the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Moving World Cup games away from a current host city would be an extraordinary decision that has little, if any, precedent in one of the world’s most important sporting events.\n \n\n   \n  The host cities were announced in May 2022, more than four years before the first ball will be kicked in the tournament. The 11 US cities, along with the other host cities in Mexico and Canada, have been spending time and money preparing for the tournament with infrastructure improvements, security planning and extensive plans to host an influx of millions of visitors that will be traveling for the games.\n \n\n   \n  But that agenda is running squarely into Trump’s tactic of sending the National Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies into Democratic-run cities – such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago and others – to crack down on illegal immigration and crime.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed federal presence in cities around the country, including just this past weekend in  Charlotte,  has raised alarm bells for his political opponents who see the operations as oppressive. While they’re nominally meant to crack down on illegal immigration, reports have circulated of US citizens being caught up in federal operations and many community activists have expressed displeasure with the unrequested help.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said his preference would be that Democratic leaders of 2026 World Cup host cities simply invite the National Guard into their cities now.\n \n\n   \n  “If they would tell us now, they’re not gonna have a problem,” Trump said. “Because if we go in, they don’t have a problem.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/national-guard-portland-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00-05:00","title":"Hundreds of National Guard Troops Deployed to Portland and Chicago Being Sent Home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown are being withdrawn, with all 200 California troops returning home and a reduction in Oregon troop numbers from 200 to 100.

are being sent home \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:55 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid  court battles  over their domestic mission by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The withdrawal of soldiers — sent from California and Texas — is part of a larger change to troop deployments after  President Donald Trump  began his  immigration crackdown  in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and requested anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  US Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, although it said there would be a “constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.”\n \n\n   \n  In the coming days, all 200 California National Guard troops currently deployed to Portland will be sent home, the official said. The military also plans to cut the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago also are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they currently are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, applauded the return of all California National Guard troops in Oregon, saying Trump “never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re glad they’re finally coming home,” she wrote in an email. “It’s long overdue!”\n \n\n   \n  Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek called on the Trump administration to demobilize the remaining 100 troops in her state, as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Members of the Oregon National Guard, who are our friends and neighbors, have been away from their families and jobs for 50 days on an unnecessary deployment,” Kotek said in a written statement. “With the holidays approaching, every single member deserves to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Trump administration  doesn’t communicate its plans  with state leaders and was still threatening to federalize more troops.\n \n\n   \n  “This confirms what we have always known: This is about normalizing military forces in American cities,” Pritzker spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Hill didn’t immediately return a message left Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue currently before the US Supreme Court —  have been pushing back . They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut in  Portland this month  issued a permanent injunction blocking Trump from deploying troops in the city, saying he had failed to establish that he was legally entitled to do so. On Sunday, the administration filed an emergency motion seeking to put the ruling on hold while it appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in  Charlotte, North Carolina , expanding an aggressive campaign that’s been spearheaded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Trump’s second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n \n\n   \n  Troops,  including active-duty Marines , were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard was also sent to  Washington, D.C. , where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Trump claimed was necessary because of crime problems.\n \n\n   \n  The deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Although they don’t play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  About 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment there, the defense official said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/style/met-gala-2026-theme","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"06:11:00-05:00","title":"Met Museum unveils 2026 Met Gala theme: ‘Costume Art’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced the 2026 Met Gala theme as 'Costume Art,' a concept developed by curator Andrew Bolton to reframe fashion as a form of embodied art, emphasizing the connection between clothing and the human body.

Rachel Tashjian, Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:11 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What’s the best dressed painting of all time?\n \n\n   \n  It’s a question the Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes to answer with its next Costume Institute exhibition, which it revealed on Monday morning will be   “Costume Art.” Opening May 10, the showcase will pair almost 200 artworks with around 200 garments and accessories in an effort to join the dots between fashion and fine art once and for all. “Costume Art” is also the show that will animate what is arguably fashion’s splashiest, starriest night: the Met Gala.\n \n\n   \n  “The title ‘Costume Art’ refers to the history of the Costume I﻿nstitute,” said Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator, who selects each year’s theme, at a press conference. Fashion, he explained, has “the status of art because of, and not in spite of, its relation to the body.”\n \n\n   \n  While fashion exhibitions at museums tend to divorce a garment from its life on the human form, here the Met will emphasize that connection as the quality that puts clothing on the same pedestal as a Greek statue or Albrecht Dürer engraving.\n \n\n   \n  Recently retired ballerina Misty Copeland was on hand to explain how Bolton plans to use garments and artworks to push against the notion of an idealized body: “What struck me most was his belief in fashion as an embodied art. Something deeply connected to who we are,” Copeland said. “The show makes a powerful case for the body in all its forms as a work of art, worthy of being seen, elevated and celebrated.”\n \n\n   \n  While the theme may strike some as sleepy — “fashion is art!” is well-trodden territory — it is the space, not the show’s theme, that may be the biggest news. Twelve-thousand square-feet of exhibition space will be newly dedicated to the Costume Institute, just off the museum’s Great Hall. “It really recognizes the central role of fashion not just within the Met, but within culture,” Bolton told CNN after the the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  The galleries carry an august name: Condé M. Nast, the late founder of the business that publishes Vogue, the style bible synonymous with the Met Gala, as well as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and GQ. The new space was made possible via a donation of an undisclosed size from the company. That will likely raise eyebrows: Condé Nast is in the news more frequently for its fading fortunes and disagreements with its union, than its financial wins.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance was Anna Wintour (sat next to Michael Kors), who earlier this year  relinquished her title as Vogue US’s editor-in-chief  but remains as Vogue’s global editorial director, as well as chief content officer for Condé Nast, meaning she retains her position supervising the annual Met Gala, which she transformed from a quiet society event into a global spectacle of celebrity and high octane fashion.\n \n\n   \n  The fashion sponsor is the French luxury label Saint Laurent, along with Condé Nast and, in another surprising fashion play, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos. Typically, the sponsoring brand will bring a few tables’ full of guests, all dressed in their clothes. Bezos and Sánchez Bezos’s financial support marks the couple’s latest move in their quest to evolve from mere cartoon zillionaires to style cognoscenti: In addition to attending the gala in 2024 and posing for the cover of Vogue US,  Sánchez’s Earth Fund recently announced a $6.25 million partnership with the CFDA to promote sustainability in fashion .\n \n\n   \n  The Met Gala, and its less influential though no less opulent exhibition, has become a red carpet machine that is arguably more anticipated and dissected than the Oscars. In a good year, the show and gala inspire the public to think more critically about the purpose and possibility of clothes. Designers jockey for months to dress stars like Rihanna, Zendaya and supermodels in boundary-pushing designs. Some of the museum’s most influential exhibitions, like  2019’s Camp-themed show , or 2011’s tribute to the late Alexander McQueen, have played a hand in making streetstyle and red carpets more outrageous or convincing the public that fashion is a craft on the level of fine art. With its upcoming exhibition and new space, Bolton and the museum are clearly keen to ensure that no one forgets fashion can demand the effort and genius required of a Renaissance masterpiece.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, confusing or milquetoast themes have made the event feel out of touch.  2024’s “Sleeping Beauties,”  which used AI to celebrate the fragility and transient nature of fashion, was too riddled by gimmicky scientific ambitions to illuminate its gowns and flower-trimmed hats, and  the previous year’s tribute to Karl Lagerfeld  neglected to account for the late designer’s controversial reputation.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Met theme was “ Superfine: Tailoring Black Style ,” and marked the first time the museum had focused specifically on the style and designs of Black Americans, and the first to highlight menswear since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  The gala, for which tickets reportedly cost some $75,000, typically raises record funds for the museum: Last year, it brought in a whopping $31 million. The gala is the sole fundraiser for the Costume Institute’s exhibitions, acquisitions and maintenance; unlike other curatorial departments at the Met, the Costume Institute receives no money from the museum’s budget.\n \n\n   \n  As for more gala details and predictions? The content machines at Vogue have their work cut out for them over the next five months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-trump-pulte-mortgage-fraud-lowell","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Federal Reserve Governor says Trump ally ‘cherry-picked’ details to make mortgage fraud claim","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is facing allegations of mortgage fraud, stemming from a referral by Bill Pulte of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who claimed she misrepresented multiple properties as primary residences.

Trump ally ‘cherry-picked’ details to make mortgage fraud claim \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said allegations she committed mortgage fraud are “baseless” and urged the Justice Department to drop its inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department  indicated this summer  it would review Cook’s mortgages after receiving a referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleging she engaged in mortgage fraud by claiming multiple properties were primary residences. President Donald Trump used the allegations as a basis to try to fire Cook. She sued to keep her job and the Supreme Court is  expected to decide   the case next year.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Monday to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin , special attorney for mortgage fraud, and obtained by CNN, Cook’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said the records indicate Cook’s applications were accurate.\n \n\n   \n  “The full record makes clear that what he claims to be contradictions in loan applications were not contradictions at all but were cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents submitted at the time and in subsequent filings by Governor Cook consistent with her applications. The referrals are baseless and should not have been made in the first place,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, who has made referrals to DOJ involving allegations of mortgage fraud against prominent Democrats, highlighted three properties Cook owns in Massachusetts, Georgia and Michigan. He alleged Cook improperly claimed they were primary residences in documents seeking mortgages, which her attorney denied.\n \n\n   \n  In the 54-page letter, including dozens of pages of exhibits, Lowell wrote that Cook took out mortgages on homes as primary residences because that is where she lived at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Cook had different principal residences over the years because her distinguished career had taken her to academic posts at Harvard University and Michigan State University, a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, and a government post at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in Washington, D.C. This reflects why different mortgage applications accurately reported different properties as her primary residence at different periods of time,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell conceded “an inadvertent notation” in a document related to a condo she purchased in Atlanta in 2021 that said the condo is a primary residence. Lowell said another loan document in the application stated the condo is a “vacation home.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because Governor Cook submitted that document to the lender as well, it would be impossible to conclude that she intended to defraud the lender by inadvertently listing the property as her ‘Primary Residence’ elsewhere,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell said Cook bought her first home in 2002 in Cambridge and it was her primary residence until she accepted an assistant professor position at Michigan State University and bought the property there in 2005. When Cook later refinanced the Cambridge home, Lowell said, she updated the paperwork to reflect it was no longer her primary residence.\n \n\n   \n  Cook has lived on and off at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, home since 2005, Lowell said. When she refinanced the mortgage in 2021, he said, it was still her primary residence because she was still employed at the school.\n \n\n   \n  Cook became a Federal Reserve governor in 2022. Lowell said she obtained permits to rent the property in Michigan until she returns when her term in Washington, DC, is up. He cites a city official as stating that living elsewhere on a temporary basis “does not necessarily make an owner ineligible for a principal residence exemption.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,” Lowell wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represents New York Attorney General Letitia James in a criminal case on similar mortgage fraud claims initiated by Pulte.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with a response from the Justice Department. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-week-11-wrap","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00Z","title":"A different type of football hits Spain, Aaron Rodgers hurt and Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut: Week 11 Sunday wrap","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NFL Week 11 schedule featured several historic, dramatic, and controversial moments, including the league’s first regular season game in Spain, where the Miami Dolphins defeated the Washington Commanders at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

\nUpdated: \n        6:56 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the season drags on and the playoff picture begins to take focus, the 2025  NFL  campaign is shaping up to be a year marked by a changing of the guard.\n \n\n   \n  More than half of the league’s current division leaders are teams on a 5-plus-year division championship drought.\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving drawing near and the long grind of the season starting to take its toll, time will tell which of these contenders has the moxie to take it across the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Week 11’s Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Football, not fútbol, debuts in Spain\n \n\n   \n  The day began with a piece of NFL history in Madrid. The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders met in the league’s first ever regular season game in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  Playing at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home ground of European  soccer  giant  Real Madrid , the Dolphins prevailed over the Commanders 16-13 in overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured plenty of kicking – an ironic turn of events in the soccer-mad nation – as the Dolphins and Commanders combined for five field goals and just two touchdowns.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, it was a 29-yard kick in OT from Miami’s Riley Patterson that lifted the Dolphins to the win.\n \n\n   \n    Aaron Rodgers exits with injury in contentious rivalry game\n \n\n   \n  In one of the league’s most heated rivalries, the Pittsburgh Steelers blasted the Cincinnati Bengals 34-12 to press their advantage in the AFC North.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers sit atop the division after the victory, seeking their first AFC North crown since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The win came with a cost, however, as Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Fame quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  left the game at halftime with an injured wrist.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers came down hard on his left, non-throwing wrist while being tackled late in the second quarter. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said after the game that his starting QB will undergo further examination on the wrist on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Later Sunday evening, ESPN’s Adam Schefter  reported  that the team fears that Rodgers has “a slight break” in his left wrist, citing unnamed sources.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers cruised in the second half without the four-time MVP signal-caller thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns and solid play from backup quarterback Mason Rudolph.\n \n\n   \n  Things turned ugly in the fourth quarter after a scuffle broke out between Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey, with Ramsey being ejected from the game for throwing a punch.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Ramsey told reporters the punch was prompted by Chase spitting on him: “He spit on me. I don’t give a f**k after that, respectfully. I’m always gonna be all for trash talking, sh*t talking, stuff like that. I actually enjoy that part of the game.”\n \n\n   \n  Chase denied the accusations while speaking to reporters in the locker room postgame,  saying , “I ain’t ever open my mouth to that guy.\n \n\n   \n  “We were going back and forth the whole time, so I’m sure something got under his skin … I didn’t spit on nobody.”\n \n\n   \n  However,  video  shot by CNN affiliate WXIX does appear to show Chase spit on Ramsey, the second high-profile  spitting incident  in the NFL this season.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the NFL handed Chase a  one-game suspension  without pay over the “act of unsportsmanlike conduct.”\n \n\n   \n    Bills beat Bucs in barnburner\n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two teams seemingly destined for the postseason, the Buffalo Bills emerged victorious after a high-scoring slugfest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured an astonishing nine lead changes, with the Bills ultimately walking away with the 44-32 win.\n \n\n   \n  Reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen improved his chances to lift the award again as he tallied a mind-boggling six touchdowns in the game. The Bills quarterback threw three TDs and also ran for three scores in the thrilling contest.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills needed the win as they try to keep pace with the surprising New England Patriots, who lead the AFC East after a 27-14 victory over the New York Jets on Thursday night.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats haven’t won the division since 2019 when Tom Brady was still under center in New England and look like the real deal this season.\n \n\n   \n    Broncos deal the Chiefs a devastating defeat\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos took firm control of the AFC West with a 22-19 win against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have won the division nine consecutive seasons.\n \n\n   \n  Denver improved to a perfect 6-0 at home this season as the Broncos’ stout defense stymied the Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ lone touchdown on the day was a 21-yard strike to tight end Travis Kelce with just under 10 minutes left in the game to put the Chiefs up three.\n \n\n   \n  The score was Kelce’s 84th touchdown, making him the Chiefs’ all-time TD leader by passing Priest Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos were powered by the mighty right leg of kicker Wil Lutz, who drilled five field goals in the game – and three in the fourth quarter – including a game-winning 35-yarder as time expired.\n \n\n   \n  After the loss, the Chiefs, who have appeared in three straight Super Bowls and seven straight AFC Championship games, drop to 5-5 on the season and are in serious danger of missing the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The road doesn’t get any easier for the Chiefs either. Next week, Kansas City faces the impressive Indianapolis Colts, who enjoyed a bye this week. Indy is one of the NFL’s biggest surprises this season; with one of the AFC’s best records at 8-2, the Colts are poised to win the AFC South for the first time since 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Broncos now sit two games clear of the Los Angeles Chargers in pursuit of their first division crown since 2015.\n \n\n   \n    Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut as Browns fall to Ravens\n \n\n   \n  After losing four straight games amid an injury to  quarterback Lamar Jackson , the return of the Baltimore’s two-time league MVP has sparked a four-game winning streak as the Ravens have clawed their way back to .500 and back in the AFC playoff discussion.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens had to rally on Sunday for a 23-16 win against the Cleveland Browns after trailing 13-3 in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Browns’ fortunes turned when quarterback Dillon Gabriel was knocked out of the game with a concussion early in the third quarter. The injury set the stage for the NFL debut of 2025 fifth-round draft pick  Shedeur Sanders , son of Hall of Famer  Deion Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Sanders’ first NFL game was a forgettable one, as the 23-year-old went just 4-of-16 passing for 47 yards and one interception.\n \n\n   \n  Tied at 16 late in the fourth quarter, the game was still in doubt until an inspired bit of misdirection just before the two-minute warning gave Baltimore its first lead since the first quarter.\n \n\n   \n  On a 4th & 1, Baltimore lined up in the “ tush push ” formation with tight end Mark Andrews under center. But instead of plowing forward, Andrews took the ball to the right edge and ran untouched for a 35-yard, game-winning touchdown.\n \n\n   \n    Darnold’s 4 INTs doom Seahawks\n \n\n   \n  With the NFC West lead on the line, neither the Seattle Seahawks nor the Los Angeles Rams played their best football.\n \n\n   \n  But in the end, Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold’s four interceptions – two of which led to Rams touchdowns – proved to be the difference in LA’s 21-19 win. Safety Kamren Kinchens hauled in two of the interceptions for LA.\n \n\n   \n  With the win, the Rams take sole possession of first place in the division at 8-2, while the Seahawks fall to 7-3 on the year.\n \n\n   \n    Eagles outlast Lions in defensive struggle\n \n\n   \n  In Sunday’s finale, the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles met the Detroit Lions in one of Week 11’s most anticipated matchups.\n \n\n   \n  The result may not have been pretty at times, but the Eagles escaped with a 16-9 home win in a game dominated by the defenses.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ offense might not be firing like it was during last season’s playoff run, but the team’s certainly sporting a championship-caliber defense. For the second consecutive week, Philly held a playoff contender under 10 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Lions’ loss puts the Chicago Bears alone atop the NFC North after the Bears eked past the Minnesota Vikings 19-17 earlier in the day. Despite a negative point differential on the season, Chicago boasts a 7-3 record as the Monsters of the Midway eye their first division title since 2018.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 11 Sunday scores\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n  Washington Commanders 13-16 (OT)  Miami Dolphins  (in Madrid, Spain)\n \n\n   \n   Green Bay Packers  27-20 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n   Houston Texans  16-13 Tennessee Titans\n \n\n   \n   Carolina Panthers  30-27 (OT) Atlanta Falcons\n \n\n   \n   Chicago Bears  19-17 Minnesota Vikings\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers 6-35  Jacksonville Jaguars \n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-44  Buffalo Bills \n \n\n   \n  Cincinnati Bengals 12-34  Pittsburgh Steelers \n \n\n   \n   San Francisco 49ers  41-22 Arizona Cardinals\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks 19-21  Los Angeles Rams \n \n\n   \n  Kansas City Chiefs 19-22  Denver Broncos \n \n\n   \n   Baltimore Ravens  23-16 Cleveland Browns\n \n\n   \n  Detroit Lions 9-16  Philadelphia Eagles \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/world/israeli-settlers-attack-palestinian-west-bank-village-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:01:00Z","title":"Israeli Settlers Torch Palestinian Vehicles and Homes in West Bank Village","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent escalation of settler violence in the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlers set fire to three inhabited homes and three vehicles in the Palestinian village of Jab’a, following Israeli forces' demolition of illegal settler outpost structures.

the occupied West Bank on Monday after Israeli forces tore down   settlers’ illegal outpost structures in the area.\n \n\n   \n  Two videos geolocated by CNN show multiple vehicles and a building on fire following the attack in Jab’a, a Palestinian village about 15 kilometers (nine miles) southwest of Bethlehem. Villagers struggled to extinguish the flames, the videos show.\n \n\n   \n  A surveillance camera in Jab’a captured dozens of masked men entering a home and setting fire to vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  The head of the Jab’a village council, Diab Masha’leh, told Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, on Monday that the settlers attacked the village and set fire to three inhabited homes and three vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  He said the villagers were able to extinguish the fires “without any reported injuries” but that “severe material damage was inflicted on the targeted homes and vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  The attack is the latest in a surge of increasingly brazen settler attacks  against Palestinians in the West Bank . In a rare move, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the violence, saying it came from “a small, extremist group that does not represent the settlers” in the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “I intend to deal with this personally and convene the relevant ministers as soon as possible to address this serious phenomenon,” he said in an apparent reference to  far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir,  an ardent proponent of settlements.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that “after the evacuation of the illegal structures,” dozens   of Israeli civilians set fire and vandalized homes and vehicles” in Jab’a.\n \n\n   \n  “Israeli security forces at the scene are   conducting searches to locate involved individuals. The incident is still ongoing,” according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, violent clashes broke out between Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank   after security forces, in an unusual move by the current government, demolished several illegal settler outpost structures near Metzad, according to a joint statement issued by the Israeli military and police. Outposts are illegal under international law and Israeli law.\n \n\n   \n  The clashes left several Border Police officers and “fighters” injured, the statement said. Metzad, also known as Asfar, is an Israeli settlement located in the Gush Etzion bloc in the occupied West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  According to the statement by the military and police, Israeli security forces from several divisions, along with the Civil Administration, began the evacuation and demolition of multiple illegal structures early Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “During the operation, violent riots erupted involving dozens of barricaded individuals and hundreds of rioters, including assaults on security forces through stone-throwing, the hurling of iron rods and other objects, as well as the burning of tires and vehicles,” the joint statement said.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli security forces arrested six suspects during the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Following the attack by settlers, the IDF said in a statement that it “views violence of any kind with severity and condemns it, as it harms security in the area.” The IDF added: “Violent incidents divert the attention of commanders and soldiers from defense and counterterrorism missions.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz expressed his full support for Israeli forces in a statement Monday. “We will not tolerate attempts by a small, violent, criminal group of anarchistic lawbreakers to take the law into their own hands and tarnish the settler public, and we will not allow them to harm IDF soldiers,” Katz said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/style/jennifer-lawrence-sothebys-jewels-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:50:00Z","title":"Look of the Week: The best luxury ad space?

best luxury ad space? Jennifer Lawrence’s earlobes \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:50 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Sunday, Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles, part movie star, part walking advert. Her white silk dress, draped across her chest in an off-the-shoulder style with a cascading leg split, was designed by Jonathan Anderson for Dior — the French luxury label for which she has been a brand ambassador since 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Many celebrities have ambassadorship roles with big brands, and are often contractually obliged to wear their designs on the red carpets and other major events. See Margaret Qualley, who often wears Chanel (much to the dismay of some social media users) since becoming brand ambassador in 2022, while longtime Louis Vuitton face Emma Stone has almost exclusively worn clothes by the French luxury house since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  But Dior isn’t the only brand that Lawrence was advertising in her recent outing. In her ears were a pair of 1987 diamond clips shaped like glittering tree branches. Designed by the American jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, they were worth between $300,000 and $500,000. The cost is an estimate, because these earrings are scheduled to go on auction next month at Sotheby’s in New York, where their price will be determined by a bidding war — presumably between some people who may have enjoyed seeing them on Lawrence first. In the same auction are several more of Rosenthal’s pieces, as well as a 1930s ruby and diamond bracelet from Cartier and a late 19th century necklace by Boucheron, worth between $1 and $2 million.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time Lawrence has acted as ad space for Sotheby’s. Earlier this month, the auction house lent her an 18-karat gold, platinum and enamel necklace by jeweler David Webb worth between $25,000 and $35,000 ahead of its scheduled auction on December 11. The actor wore the necklace to the New York premiere of “Die My Love,” her latest high-profile film with Robert Pattinson.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s has lent jewels to celebrities including Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Rihanna in the past, for the 2023 and 2021 Met Gala, respectively, with the diamond Chopra Jonas wore selling for CHF 22 million (over $27 million) days later. Lawrence, meanwhile, is making sure soon-to-be-auctioned pieces are being seen beyond the first Monday in May.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s decision to engage with fashion marketing playbook’s may help to offset a slumped high-end art market. According to 2025  data  from ArtTactic, a research firm specializing in the art market, auction sales at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips declined for the third year in a row, as ongoing inflation and rising geopolitical tensions have created a more cautious environment among investors.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in a move that is considerably agile for a 281-year-old auction house, Sotheby’s is making use of a famous face that could potentially entice new audiences. Jewels worn by celebrities have proven to drive interest (and sales) — take the influential singer Shirley Bassey’s collection of treasures, which broke a world-record when the entire lot sold in a Paris auction for €2.2 million (around $2.5 million). Could Sotheby’s recreate some of that magic by lending lesser-known auction lots to top-of-their-game actors? When the gavel comes down next month, we’ll find out if the star power rubbed off on the final sales price.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/horizon-air-cockpit-emergency","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:55:00Z","title":"Off-duty pilot who tried to cut a flight’s engines midair won’t serve prison time, judge rules","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former Alaska Airlines pilot, Joseph Emerson, attempted to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight in 2023 while off-duty, resulting in a near-disaster.

Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A former Alaska Airlines pilot who  tried to cut the engines  of a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit will serve no prison time, a federal judge ruled Monday, bringing an end to a case that drew attention to the need for more mental health support for pilots.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Amy Baggio sentenced Joseph Emerson to credit for time served and supervised release for three years at a hearing in Portland, Oregon. Federal prosecutors had asked for one year in prison, while his attorneys had sought probation.\n \n\n   \n  “Pilots are not perfect. They are human,” she said. “They are people and all people need help sometimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.\n \n\n   \n  After his arrest, Emerson  told police  he was despondent over a friend’s recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn’t slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.\n \n\n   \n  Baggio said it “offers a cautionary tale worth telling beyond the confines of this case.”\n \n\n   \n  Before she announced the sentence, Emerson spoke and said he regretted the harm he caused to society.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a victim. I am here as a direct result of my actions,” he told the court. “I can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.”\n \n\n   \n  He hugged his attorneys and shared a tearful embrace with his wife after the judge announced his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people spoke on Emerson’s behalf at the hearing, including his wife, Sarah Stretch, who told the judge how the incident had impacted their family.\n \n\n   \n  “I am so sorry for those that it’s impacted as much as it has. But I am extremely proud to be here with this man today, because the growth that he has had from this terrible experience has not only helped him, but benefited all that surround him,” she said through tears. “I just hope people realize that it’s not necessarily the mistake itself but how you respond to it. He has responded with courage, strength and demonstration of extreme resiliency.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson had pleaded guilty or no-contest to all charges against him in September as part of agreements with state and federal prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Emerson, of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft. He was released from custody pending trial in December 2023, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  A state court sentenced him to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, 664 hours of community service — eight hours for each person he endangered — and over $60,000 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group.\n \n\n   \n  Half of his community service can be performed at the  pilot health nonprofit  he founded after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any unprescribed drugs, and keep at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer.\n \n\n   \n  In their sentencing memo asking for one year in prison, federal prosecutors wrote: “It was only through the heroic actions of the flight crew, who were able to physically restrain the defendant and restore normal operations of the aircraft, that no lives were lost that day.”\n \n\n   \n  In a sentencing memo, his attorneys requested probation with credit for time served over prison or home detention, arguing that the “robust” state prosecution “resulted in substantial punishment.”\n \n\n   \n  In state court in September, Emerson said he was grateful to the flight crew for restraining him and saving his life, along with those of everyone else on board. He called it “the greatest gift I ever got,” even though he lost his career and wound up in jail, because it forced him to confront his mental health challenges and reliance on alcohol.\n \n\n   \n  “This difficult journey has made me a better father, a better husband, a better member of my community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.\n \n\n   \n  The averted disaster renewed attention on  cockpit safety  and the  mental fitness  of those allowed in them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/rebecca-gayheart-eric-dane-als-diagnosis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00Z","title":"Rebecca Gayheart Discusses Complicated Parenting Challenges Amid Eric Dane's ALS Diagnosis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rebecca Gayheart, an actress and mother of two teenage daughters, speaks candidly about her emotional and parenting challenges following her former husband Eric Dane's ALS diagnosis.

Now he’s a father facing deportation to Ukraine \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:19 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was prompt in picking up his two daughters from school every afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to him to be there for his smiley 3- and 5-year-old girls, peppering them with questions about what they learned and who they played with.\n \n\n   \n  At home with his wife, Samantha, he would always be facilitating the bubbles at bath time, meticulously brushing out tiny blonde and brunette ponytails, and tucking the giggling girls into bed after reading to them.\n \n\n   \n  But giggles have grown quiet as the young girls wonder what happened to their loving dad, who, in their eyes, simply vanished this summer. The girls haven’t seen him in 107 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on August 1, and never came home.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s legal troubles stem from an armed carjacking conviction more than 20 years ago that cost him his permanent resident status after his release in 2014. His attorneys have since vacated that conviction, and he is close to regaining his green card, but deportation is set to proceed before a judge can rule on his case.\n \n\n   \n  Now, it’s unclear when his family will see him again as the father of two learned just days ago of his imminent deportation on Monday to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war, and one he hasn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  His detainment stems from President Donald Trump’s determination to arrest and deport undocumented  migrants en masse  – an effort  fracturing families  across the country as  communities watch  their workers, schoolchildren and church members be swept up by ICE.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev had never so much as skipped an event at the girls’ school before missing his oldest daughter’s 5th birthday later in August. He was still absent for his wife’s birthday a month later, then their wedding anniversary, and soon to be the holidays – Surovtsev’s favorite time of year to spend with his family.\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been telling her young daughters their dad is at work, and gave their oldest a locket with his picture inside after he was detained. She’s been wearing it more often in recent days, her mother said, asking the photo inside, “Daddy, come home.”\n \n\n   \n  “They’re too little to understand, and there’s no way to tell them without making them fearful of their own country,” Samantha said through tears. She and the girls have been living on savings as they accumulate attorney fees, and she said she feels like she’s going through life as a single mom.\n \n\n   \n  In a court filing on Wednesday, the Department of Justice confirmed it has arranged for Surovtsev to be removed to Ukraine on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an  X post  Monday that Surovtsev is a “criminal illegal alien with a history of violence,” including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and carjacking.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys say 82 other immigrants will be on Surovtsev’s flight with the same fate, and fear for their safety in wartime Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m afraid that my life will be taken in this war, and my girls are going to have to grow up without their dad, my wife is going to have to be a widow, and I myself will lose my life in a war that I know nothing about,” Surovtsev said in a video reviewed by CNN his wife recorded during one of his calls to her from detention.\n \n\n   \n    Surovtsev found love, work and God after escaping Soviet rule\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was born in the USSR city of Zhdanov – which has since been renamed Mariupol in present-day Ukraine – in 1984. After his father, a Chernobyl nuclear power plant worker, died from radiation poisoning after it  exploded , Surovtsev fled the USSR at 4 years old with his mother and two siblings.\n \n\n   \n  The family came to the US lawfully, forfeiting their USSR citizenship, and slept in a San Francisco church for six months before settling further north in Sacramento, court filings show. But poverty followed them across California.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was a young child when he began stealing small toys in an effort to hide that his family was poor, court filings show, and he was around 7 years old when he started helping his mother work by cleaning homes and law offices. What followed was a boyhood marked by struggles to get by in his adopted country.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014. Following his sentence, an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported, costing him his green card. He was placed into ICE custody but ultimately released by the US government on an order of supervision, after it determined it wasn’t likely he would be removed from the country anytime soon, and in that case, continued detention would be unlawful, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Without USSR citizenship or a green card, Surovtsev has since lived his life as a  stateless person  with a work permit, routinely checking in with ICE. He’s never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers said in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  As his family found relief from Soviet rule in the United States, Surovtsev also found love, gratifying work, and God.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Surovtsev was baptized in prison. When he came to Christ, everything changed, his wife said. He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County. The two married, bought a home in a suburb north of Dallas, started a painting business together and welcomed their two girls.\n \n\n   \n  “He created a life here, and he’s being ripped away from it,” she said. “The person he is on paper is not the person he is now. Twenty years have passed since he committed that crime and a lot of life has been lived.”\n \n\n   \n  Between juggling the family business and raising his daughters, Surovtsev was training to be part of a prison ministry where he could travel to jails offering religious services and support for detainees.\n \n\n   \n  Then, he was detained himself.\n \n\n   \n  At the Bluebonnet and Prairieland Detention Facilities in Texas, where he has been held since August, Surovtsev’s faith hasn’t wavered, his wife said. He leads a nightly Bible study with his fellow inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Since he anticipates boarding a flight to Ukraine Monday, the group held an extra session this weekend to rally around him in prayer one more time.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, the US government plans to deport 83 people to Ukraine where they will be conscripted into the army and likely killed. Ukraine is a police state where the population lives under martial law,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Eric Lee and Chris Godshall-Bennett said in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Neither DHS nor the Ukrainian Embassy responded to CNN requests for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Among the detainees are individuals who have lived in the US since they were kids. Many have US citizen spouses and children,” the lawyers wrote. “Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev does not speak or read Ukrainian. Having fled at such a young age, Surovtsev has very little memory of the former Soviet town where he was born, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s birthplace, present-day Mariupol, Ukraine, has endured some of the most  devastating strikes and sieges  from Russia during the war. The city’s infrastructure and housing were  almost entirely destroyed , civilians suffer from  starvation , and thousands have been killed or displaced. Despite reconstruction efforts being promoted by  Russian authorities , the city remains heavily damaged.\n \n\n   \n    Lawyers say Surovtsev is close to regaining his green card status\n \n\n   \n  The US government had run into trouble trying to deport Surovtsev before.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six weeks. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  “Often when he met with officers, he was told that ICE had made a new attempt to contact the embassy of either Ukraine, Russia or both, but that either or both governments had refused to grant him travel documents,” his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans. But on August 1, he was unexpectedly detained, and an officer refused to accept his stay of removal from his immigration counsel who accompanied him to the appointment, his lawyers write in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  But now it’s unclear what documentation Ukraine may have for Surovtsev’s deportation or what changed from a decade ago, when the country couldn’t prove his citizenship.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2014 and 2015, ICE tried and failed to deport Mr. Surovtsev to Ukraine when the Ukrainian consulate told them it couldn’t prove he was a citizen,” Lee, the attorney, said in a statement. “Now we are told Ukraine is giving ‘temporary passports’ to detainees, whatever that means. To this day Ukraine has never acknowledged Mr. Surovtsev is a citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s always complied, but we knew that maybe something would be different this year, just because of what was going on with this immigration crackdown,” his wife said. “We didn’t think that this would be our reality.”\n \n\n   \n  His detainment mobilized Samantha, when she said she became his “assistant full-time” as she tirelessly drafted a legal team to get him out.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys successfully vacated Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, and will have him plead to a lesser charge that doesn’t have immigration consequences.\n \n\n   \n  This change in circumstances would justify reopening his case, which his team has filed for, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said, and Surovtsev’s lawful permanent resident status would be restored if a judge agreed to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  All his family and legal team can do is wait for the case to be heard, but it sits in a heavy queue of similar motions. There is no expedited process at the immigration court level, Rozdzielski said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of securing post-conviction relief for a past crime, he is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active warzone,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Lee and Godshall-Bennett said.\n \n\n   \n  The flight to Ukraine is poised to take off before a judge could make any new rulings. The motion was filed on November 4, and his attorney estimates a two- to three-month timeline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family, our community and our country is not better off with him gone,” Samantha said. “Even if he’s remaining in detention, we just want time for our case to be heard. That’s all we want.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/analysis-trump-military-action-venezuela-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00-05:00","title":"Whatever Trump’s goal in Venezuela, US military action is unlikely to achieve it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the potential for U.S. military action in Venezuela under Donald Trump’s foreign policy, questioning whether such action—ranging from targeted airstrikes to a full land invasion—would achieve meaningful results.

\n        3:29 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the vacillating contours of US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, little should surprise. And outlying moments of apparent success against  Iran’s nuclear program  (even if short-lived), are uneasily partnered with moments of fleeting fancy, like  seizing Greenland  (remember that?)\n \n\n   \n  But the looming possibility of  military action against Venezuela  – across a wide spectrum of violent options – drags the White House into realms of foreign involvement it has always said it loathed. And it puts it squarely in opposition to the lessons of the past two decades of US Republican military endeavors, and plenty of decades of regional experience before that.\n \n\n   \n  Just what exactly does the Trump administration want to do here, and how long does it think it will take to achieve? These are two questions an administration conventionally seeks to publicly and painstakingly lay out the answers to before military action. But it remains mired in confusion. And the variables do not look good.\n \n\n   \n  The most slender goal of military action is to stop drug trafficking. Yet this is something exceptionally hard to achieve with targeted strikes. Firstly, Venezuela is  not the hub of narco-trafficking : that is a route which begins in neighboring Colombia, and ends on the US border in Mexico. Venezuela has been a facilitator, even permitting its territory to be used to launch the planes that carry Colombian cocaine north, and harboring depots and processing plants which operate in a climate of greater impunity than in Colombia. But it is at worst a tenth of the problem, not its heart.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, the drug trade is so unspeakably profitable, no kinetic activity can really stop it. The incentives are simply too great. Consider the planes that fly north from Venezuela – booming during the first Trump term, using 50 covert runways in Venezuela’s Zulia region to move their packages to central America for onward transportation, according to Colombian officials.\n \n\n   \n  Each plane makes the trip once, and as we saw across  Honduras’ Moskitia coastline in 2019 , is abandoned in the bush. The money to be made from its cargo is in the tens of millions, while the plane is worth only about $150,000, so it is logically dumped rather than used again, decreasing the risk of capture. This is the mindset of trafficking: there is truly little couriers would not do for their part of millions of dollars, for a few weeks’ risky work. And there is too much product to get too anxious: one official told me then of how these tiny planes, when they feared interception at sea, would simply throw their cargo overboard and pay local fisherman $150,000 to return the cocaine to them.\n \n\n   \n  Traffickers have since turned to boats – and even unmanned submersibles guided by Starlink satellite internet dishes – to evade capture. A concerted US bombing campaign can at best hope to disrupt this sort of extraordinary profiteering. But you cannot kill the business unless you kill the demand feeding it in the United States itself.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is the question of affordability for the United States. The Pentagon used to be concerned about putting an expensive “warhead on the forehead” of jihadist militants a decade ago. It is wildly inefficient to send a million-dollar missile to incinerate raw cocaine, so close to source that it has yet to earn anywhere near its eventual US street value. Colombia is currently close to record cocaine production, according to the UN, so there is no shortage of powder to try to move.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration can set back, inconvenience, delay or even hamper, drug trafficking in the region. But Venezuela is not its main source, and there will always be poor, disadvantaged young men there, or in Colombia, Ecuador or Bolivia, willing to step into any vacancy left by US drone strikes.\n \n\n   \n  So what if regime change is the goal? To “shock and awe” Venezuela’s fragile and economically beleaguered authoritarian, Nicolas Maduro, into fleeing? A series of pinpoint airstrikes could destroy key assets in  Venezuela’s military  – its runways, air defenses, Su-30 attack jets, and Russian T-72 tanks. But military action is already being  discussed publicly , giving Maduro plenty of warning to move his most prized equipment, including his political hierarchy, and even himself.\n \n\n   \n  The most technologically advanced military power in history still has limitations. It may have been able to kill al Qaeda’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, using a missile equipped with spinning blades on a balcony in Kabul in 2022. But it was unable to stop its humiliating ousting from the same city a year earlier, by a far inferior Taliban force.\n \n\n   \n  US policy needs popular support from the people it is being imposed upon, and that is rarely achieved from a missile launch at 30,000 feet. In Iraq, even the tortured and false arguments amassed to remove the vile butcher Saddam Hussein ran into an Iraqi people who widely rejected occupation at the barrel of an M4 assault rifle. Many Serbians were angered by NATO bombing in 1999, even though the source of their woes, Slobodan Milosevic, was defenestrated a year later.\n \n\n   \n  Looming US action in Venezuela is beset with so many historical comparables because the US has tried this so many times before. Indeed, the one thing the US might try to foment – a popular revolt to install a more friendly government – Trump has  tried before  too.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a brief call to insurrection tried to start a military coup of sorts that seemed to aim to replace Maduro. It fell utterly flat, and I recall arriving in Caracas to scenes of underwhelming calm. The plot had barely rattled Maduro. And that was after months of intense US and Colombian pressure, in which Juan Guaido – a relatively popular reformist leader who had won recent legislative elections – presented the country with an alternative, internationally recognized government-in-waiting, ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has tried before to shake Caracas so hard that Maduro would topple, but he failed. Whatever the fate of Maduro, any repeat bid at regime change needs to be sure what follows is actually in US interests, and not a more aggressive subordinate in Maduro’s place.\n \n\n   \n  And what of the favorite canard of US military policy: the land invasion? Dropping thousands of young Americans into an angry coastal nation of 30 million, twice the size of California, is the polar opposite of Trump’s obsession with Nobel Prizes for ending wars, and lessening the US global footprint.\n \n\n   \n  It is logistically suicidal with the mere 15,000 US troops currently amassed in the region. And it would stir the acid-reflux echo of the  Bay of Pigs , where the US tried to oust a similarly leftist dictator in Cuba, in a botched operation that has become a by-word for damaging CIA overreach in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to evaluate the Trump administration’s goals as it has been purposefully opaque with them. But across their spectrum, it will find an adversary wildly more incentivized to adapt and continue, or options for regime change that have failed in the past 25 years, or even in their first term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is perhaps that the sound and fury – if this is not itself the goal of the operation – will signify enough that Maduro makes a deal to flee alive.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump’s officials run into a contradiction of their own policy here. If Maduro is the kingpin trafficker and narco-terrorist they say he is, then surely his decisions about fleeing are complicated by this role, rather than simplified? There will surely be powerful and violent people who need him to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Wherever Trump has secretly landed in his policy decisions, he may soon learn it is hard to send the guns home without using them, and perhaps harder still to know what to do with them once they have fired.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/snl-cher-musical-guest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-20:00","title":"Cher to appear on ‘SNL’ as musical guest for the first time in nearly 40 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cher is set to return as a musical guest on 'Saturday Night Live' for the first time in nearly 40 years, with her performance scheduled for December 20, 2025.

In a  discussion  with NewsNation host Batya Ungar-Sargon on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Nov. 12, Kelly stated that she knows \"somebody very close to this case\" who \"told me from the start [...] that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person's view, was not a pedophile.\" \"He was into the barely legal type, like, he liked 15-year-old girls,\" Kelly continued. \"I'm not trying to make an excuse for this, I'm just giving you facts — that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passer-by.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old, depending on the state. It is not legal for an adult to engage in sexual activity with a girl below 16 years old in any U.S. state. NPR has reached out to Megyn Kelly for comment. NPR will update this story if we receive a response from Kelly. Women and girls react to Kelly online Many on social media were prompted to insist that 15 year olds are children. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon weighed in on  Instagram : \"Megyn Kelly, I have a question for you, from one mother to another,\" she said. \"If Jeffrey Epstein were still alive, would you be comfortable with your teenage daughter being alone with him in his mansion? [...] And please, don't say 15 is barely legal. It is 100% illegal, and you know that.\" She was joined by celebrities who were former child actors, like Christina Ricci. On her Instagram story, Ricci posted, \"This woman is a danger to children.\" That Instagram story has since expired and is no longer online. Valerie Bertinelli, who starred in the sitcom  One Day at a Time,   shared  a picture of herself at 15, with the caption: \"This picture was taken in 1975. I'm 15. I'm a child. I'm gonna say this a little louder for those in the back row. I'm FIFTEEN. I'M A CHILD.\" She ended with a call to action, encouraging others to \"flood the Internet with pictures of all of us at 15.\" The Hollywood actresses were joined by actual teenagers, including a girl who posted a  TikTok video  from an account called @cheeringforchange and said her name is Eloise and that she is 14 years old. She said she wanted to respond to Kelly's comments with a \"reality check from a literal child.\" \"The minute adults start defending predators by debating the age of a child, you're not protecting the truth. You're protecting the predator. And you shouldn't need a freshman to tell you that.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Survivors advocating for the release of the Epstein files Some of Epstein's survivors who are now adults but say they were 17 or younger when they were abused have taken leading roles in pressuring both President Trump and Congress to release the full Department of Justice files on Epstein. On Tuesday, eight of them posted a \" national PSA ,\" which called for the release of all of the Epstein files. This was done in partnership with  World Without Exploitation , a national coalition of organizations working to end human trafficking. After showing photos of the women at ages 14 to 17, the video ends with a call for justice: \"It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows. It's time to shine a light into the darkness.\" On World Without Exploitation's website, it urges Americans to call on members of Congress to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act: \"By mandating the release of these files—while safeguarding the privacy of survivors—the legislation seeks to shed light on the enablers, co-conspirators, and institutional protections that allowed Epstein's operation to flourish. It aims to close loopholes that obstruct justice and ensure that no one, regardless of wealth or power, is above the law.\" The response to Kelly's comments preceded the  nearly unanimous vote in the House of Representatives  to publicly release the full slate of the Department of Justice files on Epstein's child sex trafficking. The President,  in a reversal of position , had previously stated he would sign it if it passed the House and Senate.

near unanimous margin \n         By Claudia Grisales \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:47 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Both the House and the Senate have moved to send to President Trump's desk a measure that would compel the Department of Justice to make public its files regarding the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The measure advanced through both chambers Tuesday following a day of quick action by the standards of Congress. The measure first passed the House by a near unanimous margin of 427 to 1 late in the afternoon. Less than three hours later, the Senate set up a process to approve the House measure without a formal vote after Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., offered a motion to pass the legislation as soon as it is received from the House. Once received, it will be deemed as passed. Schumer offered the measure by unanimous consent; no senators objected and the bill was approved. The legislation's success illustrated a rare win for Republicans willing to defy Trump, who has held a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress since his return to office. Republicans who supported the measure said their party needed to make good on a campaign promise to release the files. Tuesday's action followed an unexpected blessing for the measure from President Trump on Sunday. Trump's support was a dramatic reversal on a measure that previously deeply divided the GOP and has caused immense fighting among some of Trump's most ardent supporters. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Prior to Schumer's motion in the Senate, the measure passed in the House by a vote of 427 to 1.  The lone no vote came from Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins. In a post on social media, Higgins said the bill \"abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure,\" and he warned of potential harm for \"witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.\"  \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,\" he wrote.  A vote that split Republicans for months The bipartisan effort — led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.,  about her support for releasing the files , but her position was unchanged after the meeting. Ahead of Tuesday's vote in the House, Massie said that although it took four months to force the vote through a process known as a discharge petition, he was confident it would draw near unanimous support. \"We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,\" Massie said. But \"they're on our side today ... they are finally on the side of justice.\"  Until his about face over the weekend, Trump spent months attacking Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga. On Sunday, after it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, Trump said Republicans  should approve the bill .  Ahead of Tuesday's vote, survivors joined Massie, Greene and Khanna in front of the Capitol and shared harrowing stories of getting pulled into the sex trafficking network as minors, and their subsequent fight for justice. Several took aim at President Trump, saying he had politicized their fight.  One survivor, Jena-Lisa Jones, said watching their push for transparency turn political has been painful to watch. \"We are hearing the administration say they intend to investigate various Democrats who were friends with Epstein. I beg you President Trump, please stop making this political. It is not about you,\" Jones told reporters. \"You are our president, please start acting like it ... I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Greene also addressed the political fight over the Epstein files — and the president's criticism of her more specifically. She said her falling out with Trump \"has torn MAGA apart.\"  \"I was called a traitor by a man that I fought ... six years for, and I gave him my loyalty for free,\" she said. \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition.\"   The path to Trump's desk On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the vote. \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success. His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition — a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became  the decisive 218th signature on the petition . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused Johnson of stalling in order to  put off the vote . The Speaker rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved.  Tuesday's vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released  a set of three emails , followed by  thousands of pages of new files  released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604412","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-05:00","title":"Texas Appeals Ruling That Trump-Urged Voting Map Is Racial Gerrymandering","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court ruled that Texas's 2025 redistricting map, drawn at the urging of President Trump and passed by Republican lawmakers, constitutes racial gerrymandering.

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\" A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections. The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.  \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel. The panel  heard a trial   on the case  in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals. The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a  nationwide redistricting race  that  began in Texas  this summer. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement. Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda. Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House. The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature  fled the state for over  two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities. The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month  California voters passed  an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state. Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?  Republicans in the Texas Legislature  passed the map saying  it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done. But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court  that it intentionally diminished  the voting power of minority communities.  The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed. A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting, ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort. The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map,  he cited a letter from justice department  officials criticizing districts that had majority non-white voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed. Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain. That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\" Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote. \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\" Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles. \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said. Around the country,  Republicans have more options for redistricting  seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census. At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats. For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state. Blaise Gainey  covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

administration shares new moves to dismantle more of the Education Department \n         By Cory Turner \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping plan Tuesday to sidestep Congress and outsource large pieces of the U.S. Department of Education, telling lawmakers and staff that it would shift work dedicated to, among other things, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education and Indian education to other federal agencies. All three of those offices were originally placed at the department by Congress when it  created the agency  in 1979, and these moves are being made without Congress' consent. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       According to two people who were briefed on the plan by the Trump administration, and who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, the administration has forged six new agreements between the Education Department and other agencies, offloading day-to-day operations of congressionally-required programs while retaining a small contingent of staff at the department. For example, under these new agreements, much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes managing Title I, a key federal funding stream that helps schools support low-income students, would shift to the U.S. Department of Labor, as would much of the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education. The U.S. Department of the Interior would take on much of the work of the department's Office of Indian Education. The U.S. Department of State would take on international education and foreign language studies programming. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Responsibility for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program, which  offers childcare on college campuses  to low-income student-parents, would move to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In a  USA Today op-ed  published Sunday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote of this kind of agreement: \"We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest. These partnerships are commonplace across the federal government to improve service delivery and increase efficiency.\" In July, the Education Department announced one such agreement with the Labor Department, in which Labor took on responsibility for adult education and family literacy programs previously administered by the Education Department, though an  Education Department release  insisted, \"The programs will be managed alongside [Education Department] staff, with continued leadership and oversight by [the Education Department].\" Tuesday's agreements do not include a handful of the department's signature responsibilities, including special education, student civil rights enforcement and student loans. In a Tuesday  statement , McMahon said, \"The Trump Administration is taking bold action to break up the federal education bureaucracy and return education to the states.\" Opponents of the administration's move say, given that Congress created these offices and explicitly located them inside the Education Department, the White House cannot legally move their work without Congress' approval. U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a senior member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement, \"This is an outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education, and it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened—or even completely broken—in the process.\" In briefing lawmakers and staff, the department insisted that these programs' statutory responsibilities would remain at the department, even if the work would be done elsewhere.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's unclear if retaining a modicum of department staff, in partnership with other agencies, will be enough to convince the courts the administration is following federal law. According to NPR's two sources, the briefing was led by Lindsey Burke, now deputy chief of staff for policy and programs at the department, who also co-authored the education section of the conservative government blueprint, Project 2025, outlining how to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. \"The federal Department of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government,\"  Burke wrote . There will likely be legal challenges opposing Tuesday's moves. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping plan today to sidestep Congress in its efforts to close the U.S. Department of Education. It wants to outsource big chunks of the department's work to other federal agencies, and that is despite the fact that Congress wrote into law that these offices must be housed in the Education Department. NPR's Cory Turner has been covering this and joins us now. Hey. CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So Cory, tell us more about this announcement. Like, what exactly is the administration going to be outsourcing to other agencies? TURNER: Well, let's start with the really big one. Much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will be heading to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes one of the most important things the Ed Department does. It sends more than $18 billion in federal Title 1 funds to schools that serve lots of low-income students, monitoring that money, making sure it is spent appropriately and then having to figure out how much districts should get next year and the year after. Presumably, Juana, all of that is also going to be moving to the Labor Department, as well as the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education. In a recent op-ed in USA Today, Education Secretary Linda McMahon tried to explain this strategy here. She wrote, quote, \"we will peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage program and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest.\" SUMMERS: Which, Cory, raises the question, are these agencies better suited to run these programs? TURNER: I mean, I will say my inbox is full of school groups that are, at best, skeptical that the Labor Department is better suited to manage, say, elementary school policy than the Education Department is. It is worth saying much of this work is going to be done by the same people. They're just going to be moved to another agency. Taking a step back, though, you know, I think these moves are largely symbolic and being done - as President Trump and Secretary McMahon have said over and over and over again - because they want to close the Education Department. It was one of Trump's signature campaign promises. And the problem for the administration is it's not clear they can make these moves without Congress. And that is because some of these offices and the work that they do were specifically created by Congress. They exist in federal law, Juana. And that law also specifically places them inside the Education Department. SUMMERS: Which raises another question for me, Cory, which is this. Are these moves actually legal? TURNER: I mean, I think the courts are absolutely going to have to answer that one for us. It is almost certain there are going to be lawsuits to try to stop this. I will tell you, though, the Trump administration is doing something kind of crafty here. It's not actually moving these offices or their responsibilities out of the Education Department. It's moving the work itself and who's doing the work. So a skeleton crew of key people will be left behind at the Education Department, and that gives the administration a kind of fig leaf to say, well, the department isn't really offloading its responsibilities - it's simply partnering. Again, that's to use - that's the word Secretary McMahon used in her op-ed. Legal experts tell me these interagency agreements are usually used by agencies to get a little help with a certain task, not to offload entire portfolios of work. And if you look at these interagency agreements, which I have been today, they're outsourcing a whole laundry list of jobs that Congress said belong at the Education Department.

Of course, that's not for the lack of options available. There are countless tools and resources for money transfers or bill sharing, and very little resistance to incorporating Venmo or cash apps into our social lives. But those tools come into play  after  a group has decided on how to settle up. Despite how easy it is to pay for your share, the social nuances of deciding how the check will be split are not so easy to sort out. Some folks want to pay for themselves only. Other folks don't mind an even split to make the server's life a little easier. Others prefer the most chaotic option:  Oh, don't worry about it. You just get the next one. This is just one of many awkward situations that can arise among friends when it comes to wealth and privilege. Because deciding on who pays for the shared appetizer is more than a question of dollars and cents — it's a question of values and a marker of class. It's many social mores and socioeconomic forces all rolled up into one moment in time. So Life Kit   and  The Cut   have teamed up to shine a big ol' spotlight on this issue. I spoke with  Otegha Uwagba , author of  We Need to Talk About Money ,   to figure out what real-life tips and guidelines we can use to find some common ground with our peers without breaking the bank. Bring it up early and set boundaries Let's be honest. Oftentimes, we can sense that tricky conversations around money will arise at upcoming social gatherings. If this sounds like you and you're avoiding that elephant in the room, remember that it's important to make your boundaries clear and create a plan of action  before  accepting an invitation. You can say something like: This sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm keeping a close eye on my spending for the month. So I might order my meal separately from the group. Is that cool? Or: This sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm keeping a close eye on my spending for the month. So I might make dinner at home tonight, but I'll catch you next time! \n       \n      Related Story:  Good conversations take time and attention. Here's how to have better ones  \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  Accept The Awkwardness: How To Make Friends (And Keep Them) \n       This can feel really tough, understandably, because it forces you to be honest about your limitations and expose your vulnerabilities. But the alternatives are harder. Uwagba aptly points out that trying to keep up with your richer friends is an exercise in self-delusion. Eventually, you won't be able to do it anymore, and you'll have to come clean. So don't try to keep up with the Joneses' on this. Set the tone for what you are comfortable with as early as possible. Be transparent, neutral and supportive Remember, if your friendship with someone is important to you, chances are it is also important to your friend. So start conversations around this topic with an open mind and in good faith. It can actually be beneficial to your relationship. Uwagba points out that it can be helpful when both friends are forthright about their wealth and sources of additional financial supports. It was through down-to-earth conversations with her friends that she was able to contextualize her own success, she says. So encourage an environment with your trusted friends where they can feel comfortable being honest about their privilege or lack of it. Break the ice with something specific and neutral like ... I'm curious. How were you able to do so much vacationing and travel last year? What's your secret? Or: Hey, congrats on your new home! Buying a house sounds so stressful. What was your experience like? Being frank about privilege, especially wealth, is hard, but a good close friendship can survive frank conversations. In fact, they depend on them. And when in doubt, proceed with caution. \"I think you kind of just have to go slowly and see how receptive people are to what you're sharing,\" says Uwagba. \"What's their body language? Do they want to know more? Or are they sort of closed off and they don't seem engaged?\" Choose your company wisely So what if you're not so close to someone at the table or don't trust them to engage with you meaningfully? I'm sorry to say that there's no easy solution. But there is a simple one: Don't engage with them at all. Unfortunately, the root of societal tension around money is how divisive it can be. If you've made attempts at good faith conversations and boundary setting with friends but still feel awkward or uncomfortable with this topic, the best course of action may be to limit those friends in your life. \"If I feel like someone is kind of tone-deaf or insensitive or doesn't really appreciate their good fortune ... I have to say that over my 20s, I've kind of phased those friendships out, like not in a deliberate way, but just in terms of thinking who I want to spend my time around and who frustrates me to be around,\" says Uwagba. \n       \n      Related Story:  Friendships Change. Here's How To Deal  \n       Consider how much emotional labor you'd like to devote to your relationships. Does an acquaintance you see occasionally at parties merit the time it takes to have nuanced and trusting conversations? Or would it be easier to stick to small talk and keep it moving? These are tough questions to ask. But at the end of the day, only you can decide whether your friendship is worth the awkward back-and-forths — and disagreements — on economic values.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AGUILERA: There's a complicated dance we all do when it comes to friendships and money. Having friends means going out, doing activities together - in short, spending money. All of my friends are from different backgrounds and make different salaries and have different values when it comes to saving and spending money, so I still don't know what the proper etiquette is when the bill comes. I haven't yet mastered the dance. And to make matters worse, since I moved to New York City, a lot of these insecurities have been turbocharged because this city is home to some super rich people. It's all very confusing, made nearly incomprehensible because we just don't talk about this kind of thing - I mean, not really. And so for this episode of NPR's LIFE KIT, in collaboration with \"The Cut,\" I spoke with Otegha Uwagba, author of \"We Need To Talk About Money.\" She helps us figure out the best way to approach the sticky situations that come up around money and friendships. She's been thinking about money and friendships for quite a while. OTEGHA UWAGBA: I mean, I was working on this book for about three years before it came out, and money and having it or worrying about not having it is something that has really kind of dominated my life for various reasons. And certainly in my 20s, it's something that I gave a lot of thought to. AGUILERA: Otegha says there's a reason why it's so hard to talk about money with friends. UWAGBA: Money becomes shorthand for someone's value as person, and so it kind of isn't surprising that we find it difficult to talk about it openly, that we feel discomfort or shame. The amount of money you have invites judgment. AGUILERA: And she says money conversations can also serve as sort of a compass, pointing you in the direction of people you actually want to spend time with. UWAGBA: If I feel like someone is kind of tone-deaf or insensitive or doesn't really appreciate their good fortune, I have to say that over my 20s I've kind of fazed those friendships out - like, not in a deliberate way, but just in terms of thinking who I want to spend my time around and who frustrates me to be around. AGUILERA: We started out with the basics. When is it appropriate to talk about money with new friends? UWAGBA: I think what's appropriate to ask kind of depends on how close you are as a friend, you know, in the same way that I probably wouldn't ask a total stranger, you know, oh, how did you pay for your apartment? Who pays for your apartment? How did you get on the housing ladder? But if someone - you know, if a friend of yours mentions something that they're doing that requires money and you kind of can't add it up and you don't understand how it fits and OK, we've just bought a second home and that sort of thing, I think it's very appropriate to - just in quite a neutral way, just to say, oh, how have you made that happen? How have you afforded that? You know, I know it's expensive. Like, I think for me, it's about tone and delivery and asking in a nondefensive, nonjudgmental way. And that's what I've found is most effective. I think if people are going to talk about the kind of lifestyles that having money enables them, then I think it's kind of fair to expect that other people might potentially have questions. AGUILERA: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So in that case, what conversations about money should we be having with our friends, and what kind of boundaries should we set with them on the outset? Have you worked out any kind of strategies? UWAGBA: I think the main kind of conversations I have with my friends is kind of in a social context. Like, do you want to go to this restaurant? Do you want to go on a holiday? I mean, just last week, a friend said, hey, a couple of us are thinking of going to Mexico for New Year, and I just said I've had a really expensive year. I also had a really nice holiday over the summer, so I don't think I can afford this one. I'm going to sit it out. And she was totally understanding. And, you know, being honest about your limitations, both with your friends and with yourself - like, I think self-delusion is one of the, like, most expensive habits - trying to keep up with your friends or compete with friends who have more money than you do. And that's, like, kind of, like, on a day-to-day level. But on, like, a broader level, something that I didn't have in my 20s and that I felt quite embittered about and I write about in my book is that I wasn't having a lot of honest conversations with friends whose parents had given them, say, the money to put down a deposit on a flat or maybe were paying their rent. And I, for years, didn't understand how everybody else was going onto the housing ladder, and it just seemed completely impossible for me. AGUILERA: Been there. UWAGBA: Exactly. Like, I think a lot of people have been there. And it was only towards the tail end of my 20s that I found the sorts of friends who, A, were in a similar position to me and, B, were more willing to talk about that even if they had had help. If they said, you know, I've bought a place, they'd be like, yeah, my parents helped me. My parents gave me a deposit. My - and it was just that honesty that I was looking for. AGUILERA: Yeah. Transparency seems to be the way to go and just approaching the topic, trying to be as neutral about it as possible. But let's say that we're in the position of being the privileged ones, you and I, and we need to talk about - you know, with somebody who is not as privileged as we are. Where is the line between, you know, just being transparent about our financial situations and say, like, oh, you know, this turned out to be a very successful book, so now I'm able to do this, and where do you feel like it starts to get into bragging? Because that seems - I'm struggling with that a little bit with my friends back home. And I want them to be proud of me and happy for me, and I want them to know the details. I don't want to omit anything. But I also don't - I don't know where the line is. UWAGBA: That's an interesting question. I think you kind of just have to go slowly and see how receptive people are to what you're sharing. And, you know, is somebody asking questions about it? You know, if you say, OK, I signed this book deal and actually I got paid a decent chunk for it or I've made a decent chunk in royalties, you know, what's their body language? Do they want to know more or are they kind of closed off, and they don't seem engaged in it at all? And I think that can kind of tell you more about it. Like, I think if you are already conscious and worried about bragging, then I think it's highly unlikely that you are. Like, people who brag tend to just not be very self-aware. I have found, from being on both sides of the coin, is that it's incredibly sort of crass to fret about your money worries to a friend whose problems probably outstrip yours. So if you're telling them about these financial successes you've had, now is also not the time to complain about, oh, but so-and-so got more for their book deal or so-and-so, you know, got this cushy new job. I think that is what I find that people tend to get wrong, which is that they don't target, I guess, their complaints and their gripes and their issues at the right audience. So I'm like, go talk to your rich friends about that. Like, they will understand that - you know, why you're annoyed about that. Like, I think you really have to know your audience. But I - you know, I also don't think you should be embarrassed about financial success. But I think, again, it's just about being honest and honest about what it's allowed you to do and honest about what your limitations are, as well. AGUILERA: Yeah. And on the flip side there, let's say that's, like, a one-on-one conversation. Those are very deep conversations. But let's, like, step back to, like, a group of friends and, you know, the things that come up with us in money in groups of friends all the time - splitting checks at dinner. It's always going to be awkward. It's always weird. Nobody addresses it until the check comes. And it's always this, like, awkward, what are we doing? - kind of situation. And in my experience - and this is a very generalized experience - but rich people are kind of cheap (laughter). And I know this from being a waitress myself sometimes. So in a situation where you're in a group setting and somebody wants to split the check evenly, somebody wants to have everyone pay only what they ate, how do you navigate that? UWAGBA: I think it's helpful to be the person who looks out for other people in that situation, and that's kind of what I tend to do. So if I've gone for dinner with friends, and let's say one of my friends isn't drinking or doesn't drink - and obviously that tends to bump the bill up. Like, whether or not it relates to me and my spending, I do kind of tend to look out and say, oh, so-and-so, well, she didn't actually drink, so I think we should, like - she should pay less and that sort of thing. I think that can be a really good thing to do within your friendship circle because then you're kind of advocating for each other. Now when I go out for dinner or I go out for meals, I kind of go out and I'm like, OK, this is going to cost me, and I'm kind of prepared with that. And so I either opt in to the occasion as a whole or I opt out. So, like, I - because I think it can be really tricky to kind of navigate the bill-splitting situation. So I'm either like, OK, well, I'm going out for dinner and this is going to cost me or I can't really afford this at the moment, so I'm going to skip dinner. Maybe I'll meet them afterwards for drinks and just be quite honest about it. It's kind of a muscle, I think, kind of building up the ability to say, hey, this is slightly out of my budget. Do you mind go - do you mind if we go somewhere cheaper or do you mind if maybe one of us cooks at home? You know, I can host you guys at mine. And the more you do it, the easier it gets. And you often find that other people within your group are actually kind of grateful to you for doing that because, like, they also maybe don't want to spend money or they also are kind of feeling a bit strapped or, you know, they're just generally quite sympathetic. AGUILERA: Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm afraid to bring up money to my wealthier friends because I'm afraid that they're going to think that that is the reason I'm friends with them. Like, I can tell that that is, like, a No. 1 fear, is, like - one of my friends, for example, is deathly afraid that people are only friends with her because they, like, assume that she's going to hook it up constantly. And I end up spending more money than I want to just to make things simple when I hang out because I don't want to have that, like, tension hanging in there as, like, am I saying - you know, am I hanging out with you because I want to hang out with you or am I hanging out with - you know, it just - how do I stop that whole section of tension and without making it awkward? How do I convince - like, lay that foundation that I'm not friends with you because, you know, you can get me into these parties or you have this amount of wealth? UWAGBA: Well, I think you kind of have to suck up that it is going to be awkward when you kind of have the initial conversation that I'm going to advise that you have - like, an honest conversation and in, like, a neutral setting. It's not the next time you guys go out and you're at a really expensive restaurant or bar or whatever. But maybe if you're going for a walk or, like, she's over at yours and just saying, hey, you know, do you think we could - like, and kind of suggesting alternative of the things that you can do that are maybe a little bit more in your budget and just say that, like - just be really honest. Like, we are not in the same financial position, and I don't want our friendship to be kind of based around what we can do with each other that involves spending money. Like, I think one of the weird silver linings of the pandemic was I realized how much I could sustain certain friendships without spending money because we couldn't go out. We couldn't go anywhere. And so there were a lot of phone calls and a lot of walks in the park and, you know, when restrictions eased to an extent, a lot of, like, dinners at people's houses. And it made me realize how we'd kind of gotten into this cycle of thinking the only way we could socialize with each other was to go somewhere expensive - you know, service charge and get an Uber home. And actually, that was all periphery to our friendship. AGUILERA: Yeah. That's a great note, too, about the pandemic, like, stripping away all these, like, structures that we put ourselves into. What if you're a guest, like, and you go visit a friend? Is treating them appropriate or polite? UWAGBA: Oh, definitely. Let's say you go and stay with a friend. They put you up for a week or something. It's polite to buy a present on the final night that you guys go out. You take them out to a nice restaurant, and you pay. Like, that to me is just, like, social niceties and politeness. And in a way, I think those things - the need for those things kind of diminishes the longer you've been friends. I will just kind of turn up and, like, just flop on their sofa because it's like, we're kind of beyond the point of those social niceties. So it definitely does kind of depend on the nature of a friendship, but it's always nice to, like, offer a token of gratitude. And I think it's something that I always kind of try to do if I'm - if somebody has been generous with me. It doesn't have to be expensive. I think it's just the thought and the effort that counts. If staying with someone has saved you money - let's say it saved you - let's say you're going to visit a friend in a different country, and instead of having to pay for a hotel and Airbnb for a week, they let you stay in their place. Well, then you kind of have to think about it as, OK, well, I've saved, you know, a thousand dollars, so I can carve off a chunk of the thousand I've saved and maybe buy them, like, a really nice present. AGUILERA: Yeah. Yeah, I'm really glad that you mentioned that the need for those niceties diminishes as you get closer to someone because I definitely have that experience. UWAGBA: Yeah, I'm, I think, way less polite with my, like, very close friends than with people I don't know as well, which - I don't know what that says about me. AGUILERA: Yeah. What do you think the biggest takeaway that you have come away with about this whole topic since writing your book and since thinking about it in such a, you know, deep way? UWAGBA: I think one of the most toxic emotions around money can be shame. And I think that can be the thing that just, like, emotionally stops people from making progress in how they feel about money. I think one of the best ways to alleviate shame is having conversations with people in your life or conversations with therapists. I think we're really conditioned not to talk about money and not to admit to some of our more base instincts and some of our more negative emotions, whether it is jealousy or bitterness or resentment, all these things. And it kind of keeps us trapped, and it keeps us locked, and it stops you from really establishing a healthy relationship with money. So that is the main reason that I think that we need to talk about money because it absolutely can be transformative for how you feel about money.

Cliff Tan , a London-based architect who runs  dearmodern , a design account on TikTok with nearly 3 million followers, has some ideas on how to upgrade your living area — without spending a lot of money on new furniture, renovating or moving house. These ideas are inspired by the principles of feng shui, the ancient Chinese practice of designing spaces to promote harmony. When decorating, you want to consider the flow of energy in your home and create \"an environment that makes you feel good and supports whatever you're doing,\" Tan says. That might mean rearranging your existing furniture, being intentional about the purpose of each room and adding more light to your space.

Keep the entrance to your home unobstructed \"The front entrance is the most important part of the home,\" says Tan. And it's often people's first impression of the house — not just for visitors but for yourself as well. In feng shui, the doorway is a gateway for life energy, or chi. And you can do a lot to affect how energy flows through it, says Tan. One way is to make sure the doorway is as unobstructed as possible. Examine your entryway. Is there a lot of clutter around it, like shoes, coats, bags or umbrellas? Or \"a pile of recycling bags that you have to kick every time you open the door?\" says Tan. Find ways to keep the area clear. Put items back in the shoe rack or the coat closet where they belong. Or repurpose a table or bench from another part of your house to neatly store your recycling (in a cute bin if you can find one) and your keys. 2. Handle the ugly things first So you're gazing around the house, an ongoing list of projects dancing in your head. Where should you start? \"With the ugliest things in your life,\" says Tan. \"Deal with the worst things first. That's where the impact is greatest. There's no point in creating a cute shelf in the kitchen when every time you walk in, you see this shoe rack and it makes you angry.\" If one bad element is ruining your harmonious feelings about your space, \" fix that first ,\" says Tan. It will free up your energy to make more balancing adjustments. Put the shoe rack somewhere else — or if you want to leave it in your kitchen, \"make it nice,\" says Tan. \"Paint it pink, build a curtain around it.\" The way you problem-solve can turn an annoyance into a statement piece or even a favorite part of your home. 3. Spend your time in the nicest part of the house Walk through your house and ask yourself, \"Which is the nicest part?\" says Tan. The most pleasant areas are usually by a window. As a source of light and natural ventilation, they can help circulate light, air and energy. That's where you want to spend most of your time. \"This sounds like common sense, but you'd be surprised how often this is not done,\" says Tan. For example, some people who work from home tuck their desk away in a dark corner because they don't want to be reminded of work when they're off the clock, says Tan. \"Even though they spend eight hours a day working, they'd rather have their empty couch in the beautiful sunlight.\" So move your desk by a window and \"let the light shine on your face, which can also give the impression that the room is much brighter,\" says Tan. 4. Create an energy that makes you feel safe and comfortable When you're at home, you want to feel safe and secure, says Tan. In feng shui, you can achieve that by placing yourself in what is called the \"command position,\" he says. Whatever is behind you should be nice and sturdy and make you feel in charge of the space. In a bedroom, always put your bed against a solid wall, and try not to point your feet toward any openings in the room, says Tan. Too much energy comes through doors, and that can make sleepers feel vulnerable. And don't put your head next to a door. \"I will do anything I can to keep my head safe from all that movement.\" 5. Use multiple lamps to create warmth and consistency According to feng shui, supplementing any natural phenomenon (like light) must be done with care. To mimic the varying lights and shadows in our natural environment, use multiple sources of indirect light to illuminate a room, says Tan. A big, overhead light glares \"down the floor\" and casts strong, unnatural shadows. Table lights and spotlights, however, create depth by giving you more control over the direction and quality of light. Use these smaller lights to highlight areas of focus, like a piece of artwork or a reading nook. To create a sense of warmth and consistency in your home, \"make sure all your bulbs are the same color temperature,\" says Tan. He recommends bulbs between 2700 and 3000 kelvins. They offer a cozy, relaxing glow. 6. Consider a room's dimensions when picking out furniture Social media can be an exciting place to find interior design ideas, but what might work in one room may not work in another. That's how you end up with a beautiful round table that looks lost in your long, rectangular dining room, says Tan. \"It's too fat, it's too short and it doesn't fill up the space.\" When designing a room, the goal is to optimize flow, says Tan. You want to keep energy from moving too quickly through the space, but a room that's too stuffy or cumbersome to navigate around can also feel stagnant.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So pick furniture that interacts well with the room. You don't want a coffee table so large that you're always barking your shins when you try to get up, and you also don't want two small armchairs in a zone that would be much better for a full-size couch. \"Nothing beats working with your space,\" says Tan. Your furniture should showcase the best qualities of the room and \"make the space as good as it can be.\" This episode was produced by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:   Hey. What's up, everybody? Andrew Limbong here, in for Marielle Segarra. My first solo apartment sucked (laughter). It was in a basement in Washington, D.C, and it was small and dark and kind of muggy all the time, but the thing that bothered me the most about it - the thing that still bothers me today - was that the kitchen sink was so small, you literally couldn't fit a plate in it. Like, a lone plate had to go in diagonally, and not only that, but the faucet, for some reason, was extra long, and so in order to use the sink and not get water all over the floor, you had to shimmy it to the side a bit. I did not like being there, but I also didn't do anything to make it better. I figured, why bother? Who cares? I'm just renting, so there's no point in putting any effort into the place. It's an attitude entirely based on some imagined future where I'm in the perfect place where I could really let my aesthetic dreams flourish, but there really is no reason to wait. On this episode of LIFE KIT, reporter Adwoa Gyimah-Brempong is going to walk us through some ways to make those apartment decor dreams a reality - right where you are. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ADWOA GYIMAH-BREMPONG, BYLINE: I have moved a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Right now, I live in a cute little one-bedroom apartment. It's the eighth long-term lease that I've had in my adult life. For all of that time, I've been a renter, and I'm not alone. As of 2017, when I was on my sixth apartment, there were more renters in America than there had been in the previous 50 years, and as of 2022, about half of American renters were what's known as cost-burden. That means they're paying more than 30% of their income in rent. People are renting for much longer than they have in the past, twice as long as they were in the 1970s. Within that group is a subset known as forever renters - folks who don't own their homes and, by circumstance or by choice, maybe never will. So what's a forever renter to do? A tiny kitchen that might not bother you in a six-month lease may be a lot more frustrating after two years, and you may not be overflowing with cash to solve the problem. Enter DIYs. My current apartment has bright walls, a ton of storage and plenty of places to hang plants, bags and lighting. None of that was here when I moved in. I did it myself. I spend a lot of time in this space, so it's important that it feel good to me. CLIFF TAN: The first thing is really understanding your space. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAN: It's better to kind of understand and appreciate what your space can give than to try to force it away. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's Cliff Tan. He's the architect, author and feng shui practitioner known as dearmodern on Instagram and TikTok. Cliff says it's important to use your senses to figure out what a space has going for it. TAN: Where is the nicest part of the space? Where's the less nice part of the space? Most of the time, the best part of the space is where there's a window, nice fresh air, nice natural ventilation. The worst part of the space is probably, like, far, far away in the darkness or something like that, close to the entrance way. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So takeaway one - get to know your space, but it's just as important to get to know yourself. How do you want your home to support you? TAN: So what you want to do next is to understand what activities you spend most time doing. If you spend most of your time on your couch, watching TV, you want to be close to the window. If you spend most of your time working from home, you want that close to the window, too. So it's about placing your most frequent activities closer to the nicest part of the home. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I work from home, and I'm a homebody. A big, cozy couch is more important to me than a desk or a formal dining room table, and I didn't have room for both, so I installed a cute little gateleg table that folds down against one wall. Now, I have a working surface when I need one and a place to hang out the rest of the time. Cliff says it's also important to understand not just where things are placed in your home, but how that feels. TAN: Energy makes its way through your home based on how you flow through your home, so this is why the same home can have different energy paths depending on who lives in it. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And that's why it's important to start your arrival off right. TAN: The front entrance is the most important part of the home, because that's your first impression - not just for new guests who come, not just about showing off how beautiful your home is - it's also to yourself. You need to feel good every time you come home. Even something as simple as having a pile of recycling bags right by the entrance that you have to kick every time you open the door - you have to push the door, to shove it in to go through - that is enough to minus two points every time you come home, which, compiled over 10 years, you will hate your home, and you can't wait to move. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: When I first moved in, my home had no storage in the entryway whatsoever. I was always putting my purse on the ground and forgetting gym supplies across the house, so I installed hooks for my bags, keys and even a hand fan. Then I upcycled an IKEA shoe cabinet that now does triple duty as a linen closet, workout supply storage and a gathering point for my electronics. That brings us to takeaway two... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: ...Don't get hung up on what something is supposed to be for. Think about what you could turn it into instead. This is how bread baskets turn into side tables and tomato cages can become plant stands. AMANDA POE: I think so many times, renters feel really restricted by the exact thing that they have in their home. And I think there's a really easy way to look around and say, what do I really wish this apartment had and see if there's a way to make that happen. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's Amanda Poe. She's an attorney by day, and she also runs the home decor Instagram page Bohofrisco. The project grew out of her frustration with beige, white and neutral-heavy home decor stores. POE: The desired to DIY really came from not being able to source the colorful things that I wanted, and so making them on my own was the best way to find them. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: You probably have at least one interior design dream. Some people want a claw-foot tub. I would love a lofted bed one day. And for Amanda, that element was a fireplace. POE: I was always so jealous that people were decorating seasonally for their mantles. You know, they were putting their garlands or their wreath above it. And then I realized, like, oh, if only I had a fireplace. And so with a couple of pieces of wood, and a weekend, we built one. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So you're gazing around the house, an ongoing list of projects dancing in your head. Where should you start? TAN: I will say you start with the ugliest things in your home then. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: (Laughter). TAN: Like, it sounds funny but, like, look for the things that are actually ugly in your home, like the shoe rack. You deal with the worst things first. That's where the impact is the greatest. Because it's like no point creating a cute little shelf in the kitchen when every time you walk home, you see the shoe rack and it makes you angry. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So Cliff brings us takeaway three - start with the worst thing first. Once you've improved whatever bothers you the most, the statement pieces can follow, and he's so right. I hated the overhead light in my place so much - so much. It wasn't until I brought in some funky lamps and could really turn off the big light that the room came to life. So think about what's bothering you about your space - the lack of storage in the closet or nowhere to put all your books - and focus on that first. Contractor lights aside, my apartment was pretty great when I moved in. I have three criteria that are non-negotiable - good light, top floor, no carpet. But several people I spoke to told me they took much bigger risks when selecting their spaces, including Chyelle Milgrom, also known as fbmarketslut on Instagram and TikTok. She finds gorgeous vintage pieces, as is or for restoration on Facebook Marketplace. Today, her apartment is lovely. It has huge windows and a ton of cool projects, including painted doors and a glass brick wall. But when she first viewed it... CHYELLE MILGROM: The moment we stepped into this apartment, our, like, eyes burned. It, like, reeked. It smelled like cat [expletive] and feces. I have, old videos on my Instagram of what it looked like previously, but there was, like, green and red walls. There was, like, fluorescent blue murals somewhere. It was really a [expletive] mess, and it was, like, absolutely horrific. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: After cleaning it within an inch of its life, the first thing she tackled was the paint. And Amanda gives us the details on why. That's takeaway four. Paint is a high-impact upgrade. You may be thinking, am I allowed to do that? The official answer is, check your lease. But on a practical level... MILGROM: When you paint a wall, all you have to do is paint it back. That's it. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I love paint projects, both on and off the walls. But I don't always get it right on the first try. And there's a pink wall in my house that I painted three separate times until I got the color right. Amanda had some tips for me on how to minimize the guesswork. POE: You really need to start with a swatch. You bring those home into your space, not the fluorescent lighting of the store. Then you move on to a paint sample. Also the different walls, even in your room, are going to look different. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I found that one out the hard way. My living room faces south onto a balcony. So the space gets very different amounts of light throughout the year. It's brighter in winter when the sun is low enough to shine directly into the room. So the little patch I painted didn't show me what the whole wall would look like when it was done. POE: Let's go big. Let's not try to imagine the whole room with a Post-It note size swatch. Let's get a poster board from the store, spend $1 on it, paint the whole swatch, and stick that on every wall, you know, trying different times, mornings, afternoon. The time you're going to spend in the room. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: The other nice thing about paint is that it's reversible. Many DIYers will say that for some projects, it's better to ask forgiveness than permission. But with repainting, if you're thorough, it will look like that pink wall was never there. Amanda has a series called \"Renter-Friendly Reality Check,\" where she brings viewers along on the takedown process of a project. I asked her how she handles paint situations that need a more serious rescue. Some landlords do leave paint in an apartment for minor patches, so you could always ask. But if you're flying under the radar, here's how to make it work. POE: I would say the most important things are the sheen, obviously, and the color. And so even if you color match perfectly, but you get the sheen wrong, the place that you repaired is going to stick out so bad. I would say when your paint is peeling, like, maybe your project has gone wrong, pulling up like more than an inch of a swatch, like something bigger than a quarter, that is going to give you the best surface so that you can take it to your local hardware store, and they have a system that will paint match it with a computer. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Then she dropped some wisdom on me that I could have definitely used in one of my first college apartments. POE: Sometimes you can peel up paint from places like a really common place to grab some paint would be behind an outlet cover, because if you peel some of that paint away, you can put the outlet cover back and it would never know that that paint was missing. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I loved it. (LAUGHTER) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: This is brilliant. So a little paint can go a long way. But there's another element that can completely transform a space. Chyelle and Cliff agree. Takeaway five - lighting is the key to a room. MILGROM: Lighting is, like, the biggest thing that affects a space. I think it's the most pervasive as well as it can be the most eye-catching thing. TAN: Because a light is a light, it actually glows, so it attracts your attention. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's for better or for worse, as I discovered in my living room. There's an ongoing TikTok trend called we never use the big light. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I don't have many rules for my house, but I do have one, and that is that we never, ever, ever, ever use the big light. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: The big light is that central overhead lighting that is so common in rental units. It can bring a harsh energy to a space. But even if you draw the short end of the stick as far as lighting goes, Cliff says there are ways to work around it. TAN: If you are going to rent for longer, you could change your - let's say you have canned lights. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Canned lights are those recessed lights in the ceiling. They're like a step up from the standard contractor rental light. TAN: You could buy canned lights that are adjustable, meaning you can point them in different directions. Find the same can light with the same hole size and just replace them one for one. And then you have all these canned lights that can now point around. And I can shine it onto your artwork, shine it onto your table, and create focal points. Instead of just glaring down the floor, you can create a bit of depth using the lights that you already have. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And even if you don't change any fixtures at all, there are other things you can do to make a space feel cohesive. TAN: Make sure all your bulbs are the same color temperature, which is like 2,700 Kelvins, 3,000 Kelvins. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Light comes on a spectrum from cool to warm. Cool light is bright and good for task-oriented spaces like a kitchen. Warm light, in the 2,700 to 3,000 Kelvin range, is nice and relaxing. TAN: Decide on one and make sure your whole house is the same. It will make your house more consistent. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: My place has a bit of everything - rewired sconces from big-box stores, DIY mushroom lamps, paper lanterns. My favorite is a two-foot-tall table lamp shaped like a miner from the San Francisco gold rush. Just like my Ikea entryway, once you start looking at form instead of function, there are so many great places to find things to upcycle. Thrift stores and architectural salvages are a great source of raw materials. When you find a good one, become buddies with the people who work there. Do they get their best deliveries on a certain day? Find out when that is. I have a rule that I don't spend more than $100 on anything other than a couch or a bed. So for online shopping, I'll figure out what I want, set some Craigslist alerts and wait. Chyelle has some Facebook marketplace search tips, too, and they do not involve typing out fancy designer names. MILGROM: If I actually did that on Facebook, then it would show me a bunch of people who know exactly what they're selling, and will sell it for those expensive prices, which, you know, good for them. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: But those of us with champagne tastes on a beer budget are probably better off finding people who just want to get that old piece of furniture out of their grandma's basement. MILGROM: And normally, those people will just use very generic language, for instance, teak shelving unit or wood shelving unit. Funky is another keyword that I like to use if you want to, like, find a funky chair. Sometimes you'll get lucky, and you'll find, like, an Eames. Keep it generic. And if you are going to go specific, then be willing to, like, open your wallets wide. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: If the photos of that Eames chair look like stock images and the price is suspiciously low, remember to keep an eye out for scammers. MILGROM: Always look at their profile. You can look at their account. You can see, like, when they opened their account. For instance, my Facebook, it's been open since, like, 2009, back when, like, I was in middle school or elementary school. It kind of shows you that I'm a real person and I've got, like, real friends and whatnot and, like, embarrassing profile pictures versus someone who, like, just opened their account last year and has one picture and no friends. Kind of shows you who might be a scammer. Also, if they ask for, like, Zelle upfront, then they're probably a scammer. Try not to pay anyone anything until you see the item in person. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: In your DIY journey, you'll likely need to fix something you found on Facebook marketplace or maybe you want to customize a goodwill frame. So takeaway six - when assembling what you need, get creative. Whether it's an actual thrift store, a reuse market or an Ikea hack, think big about how to find what you need for a project. And that's not just materials, but all the tools you need to get your project done. My DIY starter kit has five elements. First, a measuring tape. And I carry a small one with me at all times, just in case I come across something that could work for an ongoing project. Then a small set of basic tools like screwdrivers, pliers and a hammer. A level is important for anything that's going to have a flat surface. A drill, drill bits, and drywall anchors are probably my most used tools. You can use those for anything from hanging something on a wall to drilling a hole in ceramics to use as a pot for plants. And lastly, those paint supplies, but there are also larger supplies that you may not need to keep on hand. A lot of public library systems have tool-lending libraries that members can use. There are also maker spaces with larger things like saws, and some hardware stores will rent out tools as well. I've done plenty of projects I probably wouldn't try again as a renter - stapling fabric to the wall instead of wallpaper, for example. But finding a beautiful solution to what started out as a problem can be a real source of pride. POE: Yeah. It's that urge when someone says, where'd you get that? And then you say, I made it. It's like being an artist, and people come inside your canvas. They come over for dinner inside of your artwork. And that feels really cool. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And you might be living with that canvas longer than you think, as Amanda and I have both learned. How long have you been renting? POE: Our last apartment, we were there for over 10 years in the same space. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Did you expect to be there for that long? POE: Oh, no. I - (laughter) I first signed, like, a 90-day lease (laughter). GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Oh, wow. (LAUGHTER) POE: Yeah. And when we moved out, it just kept occurring to me if someone had said in that first month, you know, you're going to be here for 10 years - how many more chances I would have taken, how many more times I would have painted the walls or I would have done something that I wanted. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Some of you might still be asking, why bother to fix up a rental? Why build a fireplace or customized shelving or do anything that would threaten your deposit when it's time to leave? POE: I mean, to those people, like, do you spend money on a great dinner? Do you spend money on a concert? These are also things that are not permanent, and they improve our life in so many ways. And to the extent that maybe I'll only love it for a year, that's a really significant amount of time. Life is so short. And I think to the extent that I can decorate a room or paint a wall and make the next six weeks just full of joy every time I walk into my bedroom, I really don't think there's a much better investment. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So just to recap. Takeaway one - understand your space, which also means understanding yourself. Takeaway two - don't feel limited by an item's purpose or by what you already have in your home. Imagine what you'd like to see instead, and then figure out how to make it happen. Takeaway three - when in doubt, start with the ugliest thing in your house. Takeaway four - paint is a high-impact way to transform the space. Takeaway five - lighting is the most important part of your home. Turn off the big light and make way for table lamps, sconces and directional light. Takeaway six - get creative with where to find tools and materials. And one last thing. Don't think of yourself as less than just because you rent. POE: The temporariness of a rental is freedom. It's a get - you know, if the wall color doesn't suit you, repaint it, you know? But if the whole apartment doesn't suit you, move. That's not a choice that people that own their home get to do.

November 18, 2025 • 4:25 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump defended Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when questioned in the Oval Office Tuesday about CIA findings that the prince approved the killing of  Washington Post  columnist Jamal Khashoggi. \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Trump said, referring to Khashoggi. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it. And would you leave it at that? You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question.\" The CIA  concluded the crown prince approved the 2018 operation  that killed and dismembered Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, but Salman maintained he had no knowledge of the attack, which he's called \"heinous\" and \"unjustifiable.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Tuesday, he said that his country has \"improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again.\" Trump also dismissed questions about a conflict of interest regarding his family's business ties to Saudi Arabia while hosting Salman as president. He said that he has \"nothing to do\" with the family business and added that while he helped build a successful business, he \"decided to leave that success behind and make America very successful.\" The two men touted a deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that would bring hundreds of billions in investment into the United States in exchange for access to key military and technology assets for the Gulf nation. After a trip to Saudi Arabia in May,  the White House announced  the Middle Eastern country had made a $600 billion \"commitment to invest in the United States.\" During the meeting inside the Oval Office on Tuesday, Salman said Saudi Arabia is going to invest more than that. \"We are going to increase that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment — real investment and real opportunity,\" Salman said about deals related to technology, including artificial intelligence. It's unclear if that meant Saudi Arabia plans to invest $1 trillion directly or if Salman believes the investment will grow to be worth that much. The crown prince has expressed that Saudi Arabia has particular interest in AI. On defense, Trump and Salman reiterated plans for the U.S. to sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia. But Trump said he doesn't think Israel will be concerned about the deal. In fact, he believes the exact opposite, stating \"they're going to be very happy.\" Trump also said he could see a formal civil nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia happening eventually but \"it's not urgent.\" When it came to the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements that established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states that Saudi Arabia is currently not a part of, Salman didn't directly say whether or not the country would join. Salman said he believes having relations in the region is \"a good thing, and we want to be part of the core, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of two-state solution,\" referring to Palestinian statehood. Salman said they had a \"healthy discussion\" with President Trump on the topic and that \"we're going to work on that to be sure that we can prepare the right situation as soon as possible to have that.\" Trump added a conversation on a two-state solution would be discussed further as well. Salman's trip to the White House isn't over just yet. A dinner is planned this evening at the White House following today's meetings. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98262","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:10:00.000Z","title":"U.S. Deports Dozens of Migrants to Ukraine Amid War","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. deported 50 migrants to Ukraine in early November 2025, marking the largest such action since Russia’s invasion in 2022.

\n\n         The U.S. deported 50 people to  Ukraine  this week, a Ukrainian border official said on Tuesday, in what appears to be the single largest such deportation from the U.S. since the country has been at war with Russia. The flight landed near the Polish border in the early hours on Monday. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported 105 Ukrainians in total, with 13 in the last quarter of 2024, according to the latest data available in   ICE's publicly available tracker . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration originally wanted to send 80 people on the flight, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States. That original list also included at least one person that Ukraine had previously been unable to claim as a citizen of the country. It wasn't immediately clear why only 50 people out of the group of 80 ended up in Ukraine. Immigration lawyers have raised concerns that those deported to Ukraine could be conscripted to fight in the war. All men in Ukraine from ages 25 to 60 are eligible to be drafted, though  some women  and younger people have also volunteered. While U.S. law permits deportations, including to countries that people are not originally from, domestic and international laws prohibit deportations to place where someone may face violence, persecution or torture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has brokered deals with countries with notorious human rights records or who are facing conflict, including with South Sudan, Libya, Eswatini, Rwanda and El Salvador, to receive deportees from the United States, as it seeks to ramp up mass deportations. Six of the 8 men deported to South Sudan over the summer are still there, according to their lawyers, while the Associated Press reported that those sent to the  other countries have been imprisoned there . \"Currently, border guards have ensured their registration in the border relation for entry into Ukraine in accordance with the rules established by law,\" Andrii Demchenko, spokesman for Ukraine's State Border Service, told NPR. \"It is worth noting that Ukraine accepts its citizens in any case.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The spokesperson said Ukraine would accept any of its own citizens who had been deported from the U.S. The embassy did not answer questions regarding what would happen to people deported to the country. \"It should be noted that deportation is a widely used legal mechanism provided for by the immigration laws of most countries around the world,\" Stefanishyna said in a statement provided to NPR. \"It is a routine procedure applied to all foreign nationals and stateless persons who violate the terms of their stay in the United States, regardless of their nationality.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       One migrant first profiled by NPR fought immediate deportation Eric Lee, an immigration lawyer with a client on the flight, said the detainees include people who have lived in the U.S. since they were children. \"Many have U.S. citizen spouses and children. Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country,\" Lee said in an interview. One of Lee's clients,  Roman Surovtsev , was recently transferred through several detention centers in Texas in preparation for the deportation to Ukraine, even as his attorneys continue to fight his removal in court. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       According to Justice Department court filings, the administration had intended to put him on the flight. NPR confirmed he ended up not being deported after an immigration court stayed his deportation hours before the flight, while his case was reopened in immigration court. Surovtsev, who lived in Dallas with his U.S. citizen wife and two children, was born in the Soviet Union. He came to the U.S. as a refugee, but lost his green card when he was a teenager when he pleaded guilty to a carjacking in California. As NPR has previously reported, the U.S. previously tried and failed to deport Surovtsev to Ukraine, which was unable to provide the necessary travel documents for deportation. For years, Surovtsev completed yearly check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he was detained during his visit in August. ICE then tried to give him deportation documents, but those papers were in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       His team of lawyers was able to vacate his conviction and move forward with reinstating his green card. Still, Surovtsev has remained in detention. U.S. District Judge Ada Brown, who was appointed by President Trump, originally blocked Surovtsev's removal earlier this month through Jan. 13 but reversed her decision a few days later, surprising Surovtsev's attorneys. \"He is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active war zone,\" Lee said. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Surovtesev has already received due process. \"He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge on November 4, 2014 — over a decade ago,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences.

November 18, 2025 • 2:18 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         To the casual observer, President Trump's withdrawal of his political endorsement of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a \"traitor\" after she questioned his opposition to releasing Justice Department files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, may have come as a surprise. He did  reverse course  Sunday night, calling on the House to pass a measure to release the files \"because we have nothing to hide.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Greene has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders on Capitol Hill since joining the House in 2021. She has also recently apologized for \"toxic politics,\" warned  Trump's attacks  have jeopardized her family's safety and reiterated her support for Trump's presidency. Speaking at a press conference with survivors of Epstein's alleged abuse Tuesday morning, Greene called the fallout \"one of the most destructive things\" for people who fought to hold a \"corrupt government accountable.\" \"Watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,\" she said. \"The only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files, and the American people won't tolerate any other b*******.\" The public fight over the Epstein files is the culmination of months of criticism from some conservative that goes beyond just this one issue.  Other splits with Trump Since Trump returned to office in January, there have been several moments in the background — and sometimes foreground — where some on the right say the president hasn't delivered on domestic priorities that \"Make America Great Again\" like he promised on the campaign trail. For almost every instance, Greene has been there to articulate the disconnect. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June, Greene was among  those who questioned  how that fit with Trump's promise to end wars. \"Six months in, Steve, and here we are turning back on the campaign promises and we bombed Iran on behalf of Israel,\" Greene said on Steve Bannon's War Room show. As some Republicans expressed concern over humanitarian conditions caused by Israel's war in Gaza, Greene called Israel's actions \"genocide\" on social media. In October, the Trump White House authorized a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina in an effort to stabilize the South American country's economy and suggested plans to  increase Argentine beef imports . U.S. cattle ranchers and a slew of Republican lawmakers pushed back to little avail. Speaking to Tucker Carlson last month, Greene said the money the administration is shepherding to Argentina is \"one of the grossest things\" she has ever seen and \"doesn't understand how that is America First.\" \"It's honestly a punch in the gut to all of our American cattle ranchers and they are furious and rightfully so,\" Greene said. Then there's Republican unease with things like mass deportations and tariffs, restricting tech visas and  redistricting , as different pockets of the party's big tent object to key pieces of Trump's second-term agenda. Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't changed Unlike others who have criticized Trump and moved away from the Republican Party, Greene is still one of the most conservative members of Congress and her clash with Trump does not change her ideological consistency. In the past, Greene frequently  faced controversy  for comments about Jewish people, advanced conspiracies about school shootings and the Sept. 11 attacks and took a largely confrontational and antagonistic approach to politics. Although her apology for prior toxicity, conflict with the president and appearances on forums like The View and CNN might seem to some like a pivot, Greene isn't actually changing anything about her conservative populist message — just noting ways that Republicans haven't lived up to her views. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over the last few weeks there were also signs that Trump would eventually lash out online and disown Greene politically. \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\"  Trump said . \"She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\" Some Republicans — including Greene — would argue that it's Trump who's lost his way. \"I think that the American people deserve to be put first,\" she said on CNN Sunday. \"That's what 'Make America Great Again,' meant to me and I think that President Trump can do that if he refocuses his effort.\" At last year's Republican National Convention, Greene called Trump the \"founding father\" of the \"America First\" movement. Now she's asserting that \"founding father\" does not equal sole arbiter of what the movement looks like moving forward. The president's changing hold over the GOP  Trump has dominated the Republican Party for a decade by creating a big tent of many different — and sometimes conflicting — ideological groups and getting them to agree to his views and priorities. That's starting to change, especially as he faces record unpopularity and continues to break with his base's ideas of conservatism. Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterms, and it's not clear how much influence he will wield over who Republican primary voters pick in the 2028 presidential contest. In what would always have been a question of what a post-Trump GOP looks like, Greene's criticism is forcing Republicans to confront that question much earlier than they had planned — and with much less certainty about the possible directions the party might go. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   OK. So how did one of the president's devoted allies in Congress become a critic? A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has questioned Trump's approach to foreign and domestic policy, and part of her disagreement grows out of the Epstein files. She objected after the Justice Department decided not to release them, but her differences are broader than that. The president calls Greene, quote, \"a traitor.\" Greene says it's Trump who has betrayed the agenda he ran on. INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler is here to explain this. Hey there, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK. So she rose as a huge Trump supporter. What happened? FOWLER: Well, for the last five years, Trump and Greene have had one of the strongest relationships on Capitol Hill, but every relationship has its ups and downs. In this moment, Trump campaigned on releasing all of the Department of Justice files pertaining to Epstein to uncover what some call a vast conspiracy about powerful figures in government hiding the truth about child sex abuse. But this year, Trump has done the opposite. He's stonewalled the release and insulted Republicans who want more information, leaving some MAGA conservatives unhappy with certain aspects of his presidency so far. INSKEEP: Oh, this is interesting. You just spoke in the plural - MAGA conservatives. Is Greene expressing something broader in Trump's base? FOWLER: Well, there have been several instances where some on the right say the president hasn't delivered on domestic priorities that make America great again. And for almost every instance, there's Marjorie Taylor Greene articulating that disconnect. Like in June, when the U.S. bombed Iran, she went on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" show. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"WAR ROOM\") MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Six months in, Steve, and here we are, turning back on the campaign promises, and we bombed Iran on behalf of Israel. FOWLER: In August, she called Israel's war in Gaza a genocide, has questioned the effectiveness of mass deportations and trade wars and has been one of the few Republicans in Congress to say that Trump might not always be right. INSKEEP: Well, what has the president said about her? FOWLER: Over the last few weeks, Steve, there were signs that Trump would eventually lash out online and basically disown her politically. He said this last week in the Oval Office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what happened to Marjorie. She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think. FOWLER: But as we mentioned, Greene is not the only Republican wondering if it's Trump who's lost his way. Here's what Greene said in a CNN interview Sunday. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER AND DANA BASH\") GREENE: I think that the American people deserve to be put first. That's what make America great again meant to me. And I think that President Trump can do that if he refocuses his effort. INSKEEP: I'm remembering a very different politician when she ran for Congress in Georgia in 2020, and you were around. Is this a big change in her politics? FOWLER: This is important to reiterate, Steve - Marjorie Taylor Greene has remained ideologically consistent from Day 1. Unlike others who've criticized Trump and moved away from the Republican Party, Marjorie Taylor Greene is still one of the most conservative members of Congress. At last year's Republican National Convention, she called Trump the, quote, \"founding father\" of the America First movement. Now what you're seeing is the assertion that founding father does not equal sole arbiter of what that movement looks like. INSKEEP: What does that suggest, then, for the movement in the future? FOWLER: Trump has dominated the Republican Party for a decade by creating a big tent of different and sometimes conflicting ideological groups... INSKEEP: Sure. FOWLER: ...And getting them to agree to his views and priorities or else. That's starting to change, especially as Trump faces record unpopularity and continues to break with his base's idea of conservatism. There's always going to be this question of what a post-Trump GOP looks like, but Marjorie Taylor Greene is forcing Republicans to confront that question much earlier than they'd planned and with much less certainty about the possible directions. INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thanks so much, sir.

• 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Having trouble concentrating on tasks or getting things done? We get it. Life is a juggling act — and it can be hard to carve out time and attention to finally start that creative side hustle, clean out the garage or keep writing that screenplay. Here are five helpful ways to improve your focus, from eliminating time-sucking distractions to purposefully letting your mind wander, so you can reach the finish line. For more tips,  listen to our podcast episode . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Take a deep breath   Reported by Malaka Gharib  Stress can cloud our ability to focus, says  Arryn Robbins , a cognitive psychologist at the University of Richmond who specializes in visual search. Think of your attention like a spotlight, she says. You can increase the size of the beam or shrink it down. When you're stressed, your attention narrows, Robbins says. It almost feels like tunnel vision. \"The fight-or-flight response kicks into gear, your heart beats a little faster, and you might get a little sweaty because you're anxious.\" So if something requires your full attention, \"take a breath and calm your body down,\" she says. \"It really is your body's response to that stress that's causing that restriction in attention.\"  Find out how to use your attention to find missing objects . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Allow your mind to wander  Reported by Stephanie O'Neill  If you are finding it hard to focus, take a break and allow your mind to wander into what's called the default mode network, says Dr. Srini Pillay, a psychiatrist and the author of   Tinker Dabble Doodle Try: Unlock the Power of the Unfocused Mind . This network of brain circuitry is where magic happens, Pillay says. It's the place where our minds find innovation and creativity and often make better decisions than the focused mind. Get yourself there with something called positive constructive daydreaming, he says. Try traveling with your mind to someplace enjoyable — maybe it's a stroll through an imaginary forest or sunbathing on a warm, sandy beach.  Pair your daydreaming with some form of low-key activity such as walking, knitting or gardening. Release your mind for about 20 minutes of this fun and watch what happens.

Eliminate distractions  Reported by Mayowa Aina  If you often find yourself wasting time on social media, and it's making you feel stressed and guilty, set some boundaries, says Sammy Nickalls, author of  Log Off: Self-Help for the Extremely Online . Try turning off push notifications and deleting social media apps from your phone to create natural obstacles to accessing them. If that's not enough, use screen timers or app blockers to make it even tougher to log back on.  Are you too online? Take the quiz here. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       4. Get an accountability buddy  Reported by Marielle Segarra  If you're struggling to read more or start an exercise routine, you might benefit from an accountability partner — someone who can help you reach your goals. Research has shown that people accomplish more when they buddy up.  A 2015 study  published in  JAMA Internal Medicin e found that couples were more likely to make healthy behavioral changes, such as working out more or cutting back on smoking, if their partner adopted healthy changes too.  Find out how to find an accountability buddy here . 5. Remember, your time is precious Reported by Andee Tagle  Think about all the people and things you consider most important — your friends, your interests, your hobbies. Then think about who and what you actually spend your time on. Are the lists the same? Are you using up all your brainpower at the office and checking out as soon as you get home to the kids? Do you keep putting off learning to play that new song because social media won't stop calling you? \"If you're just giving away the only precious thing you have, which is the time of your life,\" make sure you spend it wisely, says  Oliver Burkeman , author of  Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals .

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes. \"It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,\"  posted  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). \"In debt forever, in debt for life!\" President Trump \"is creating generational debt,\" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. \"They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'\" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.) The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to  reporting from  Politico . Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea? \"It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,\" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University. \"Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,\" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.\" The 50 vs The 30 First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move. In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages. The typical American homeowner spends  less than 12 years  in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses. \" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,\" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. \"I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.\" In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.  \"I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,\" Zwick says. \"And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.\" And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree. And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than  90% of American mortgage holders  have one! The American mortgage market is weird The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries. We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a  Planet Money  episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates. Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks. A long time ago,  Planet Money  interviewed  financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as \"a financial Frankenstein's monster\" from the perspective of lenders. Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, \"I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,\" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University. \" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,\" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world. The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages  There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them. Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent). Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation! The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much. But there's more. If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth. \" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,\" Gyourko says. \" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.\" Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks. If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, \"your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,\" says Berger, the economist at Duke. \"No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,\" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house. \"And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,\" Gyourko says. \"So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.\" Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession. \" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,\" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says. Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, \"you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,\" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage. \" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,\" Fairweather says. \"But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.\" Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates. One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s. \"The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,\" Gyourko says. Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy). That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy. In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair. Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality. \"A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,\" Campbell says. \"And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers.\" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates. There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move. Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been  stubbornly high  over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years. \" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,\" Fairweather says. \"So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.\" Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move. The real fix for housing affordability So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage. The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out. The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem. \"Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,\" Campbell says. \"Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.\" So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them. Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated! \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5464815","dateOfPublication":"2025-07-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Transformative Power of Keeping a Daily Journal","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights how Suleika Jaouad, a writer and founder of The Isolation Journals, uses daily journaling as a transformative and alchemical practice to process personal trauma, including her battle with leukemia and the pandemic.

a daily journal \n         By Marielle Segarra, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Thursday, July 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Writer  Suleika Jaouad  has been keeping a journal for as long as she could hold a pen. It got her through her battle with leukemia at age 22, life after treatment and then the pandemic. But at a certain point, \"I was starting to get bored of the sound of my own voice and grievances,\" she says. So she began reading the diaries and journals of her favorite writers for inspiration:  Isabelle Eberhardt ,  Audre Lorde ,  Sylvia Plath  and  Susan Sontag . Jaouad would pick a passage at random to read before journaling and found it had a \"kaleidoscopic effect\" on her writing, she says. It allowed the \"light to fall differently,\" changing her perspective and creating new ways of thinking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She expands on this approach to journaling in her latest book,  The Book of Alchemy: A Creative Practice for an Inspired Life , published this spring. It's a collection of essays and writing prompts from 100 writers and artists, including poet and essayist Hanif Abdurraqib, writer and director Lena Dunham and illustrator Oliver Jeffers. She hopes the book \"ignites a little spark if you're feeling like you don't know what to say or you've been saying something the same way,\" she says. Jaouad, 37, who runs  The Isolation Journals , an online journaling community that she started during the COVID-19 pandemic, talked to NPR about the transformative power of writing, favorite prompts and how to build a journaling practice. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. You talk about journaling as a form of alchemy. What does that mean?  It   was   the closest I have felt to finding a direct line to my subconscious and arriving at a place of alchemy. By the end of writing my way through a journal, I felt some small shift had been enacted. Even if I had nothing of interest or import to say that day, some kind of transmutation had taken place. So \"alchemy\" feels apt when it comes to keeping a journal. In taking a moment each day to write your thoughts, show up and write your way back to yourself, you take the grist of everyday life and transform it. Do you think there's value in journaling during the difficult moments of our lives? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The journal is the space where I go to make sense of what has happened to me. [It gives me] the opportunity to reflect and figure out how I'm going to choose my response. In those moments in my life when I felt most laid bare, the journal has been a hiding place and a fighting place. Can you share some favorite journal prompts from your book? One of my favorite prompts is called \" Just Ten Images \" by [memoir writer and photographer]  Ash Parsons Story . When her adopted son was [born prematurely and] in the neonatal intensive care unit, she was exhausted and did not have time to do much of anything, much less journal. So she decided to record 10 images from the last 24 hours, and she did this every day in list form. I love the prompt because it's straightforward and always yields something unexpected. It has just enough structure that you don't have to think too hard. Another prompt I write to a lot is called \" A Day in the Life of My Dreams \" by  Hollye Jacobs , a pediatric hospice nurse. Write a day, from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep, in the life of your dreams a couple of years out. But do so in present tense. I like this prompt because it forces me not just to imagine myself in the future but to articulate what I want for myself in that future. What advice do you have for someone who is just starting out with journaling and isn't sure where to start? Set a specific duration of time you plan to do it daily. It could be five days, a week or 30 days. Only by doing it consistently do you start to write through the fog and get somewhere unexpected and interesting. Fold it into some nonnegotiable part of your routine. For me, my nonnegotiable is my first cup of coffee in the morning. I sit down at my kitchen table each morning and write in my journal with that first cup. It always happens because the coffee always happens. Keep the barrier to entry low. I was hosting a journaling club, and I asked this man, \"Why not journal in the Notes app on your phone?\" He said, \"Well, that just seems like the wrong way to journal. I feel like it has to be in a notebook with a pen.\" We have all of these expectations we bring that hinder our enjoyment of it. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to keep a journal.

(AP) — Facing a public backlash, the commission that oversees Alabama Public Television voted Tuesday to continue paying its contract with PBS, rejecting an effort — at least for now — to be the first state to cut ties with the broadcast giant because of politics and federal budget cuts. The Alabama Educational Television Commission voted without dissent to honor the contract with PBS that runs until July. The commission also voted to create a committee to explore the direction of Alabama Public Television. A motion to give the required 180-day nonrenewal notice, the first step to cutting ties with PBS, failed for lack of a second. The decision means PBS programming, which includes programs such as “Sesame Street,” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” “Antiques Roadshow” and “PBS NewsHour” will remain on the state channel at least for the immediate future. Two commission members last month had floated the idea of severing ties with PBS , citing federal budget cuts to public broadcasting and accusations by President Donald Trump and other conservatives of bias in news programs. The possibility of dropping PBS prompted a backlash from Alabama public television viewers and donors. Related Stories Alabama Gov.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Diana Isom, a 28-year-old substitute teacher, said PBS programs have made a difference for her autistic son, who initially had difficulty speaking and walking but now is at kindergarten level while still in preschool. The children at the autism clinic her son attends watch PBS programs each day, she said. “Kids benefit so much, especially autistic kids, from PBS. ... We need PBS,” Isom said. One audience member held a sign reading, “Elmo is not the enemy of the people,” an apparent reference to comments by a commissioner last month that, “PBS has made themselves the enemy of what I stand with.” The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides about $2.8 million for Alabama Public Television, although the money goes to a foundation and is not directly used to purchase PBS programming. The money is going away because of federal budget cuts. Alabama Public Television pays about $2.2 million to purchase PBS programming. Alabama Public Television Executive Director Wayne Reid said it would cost an estimated $3.5 million annually to replace the programs and digital support they currently receive from PBS at the cost of $2.2 million. He said dropping PBS would also likely cause the number of memberships, which provides substantial support, to plummet. “I think it’s clear from a very strong presentation by the executive director that not continuing with PBS would essentially be the death spiral of APT as we know it,” audience member Michael Sznajderman told the commission. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday had urged the commission to pause the decision until it has studied Alabamians’ opinions on the matter. Commission member Les Barnett proposed giving PBS the 180-day renewal notice required by the contract. He said that would give the state options if they decided to go in another direction after the study is completed. The motion failed without a second. Barnett had been one of the commissioners who had suggested separating from PBS. The action Tuesday continues the immediate relationship with PBS, although the commission could come back at a later time and act to sever ties. “Today was kind of an indication they aren’t interested in going that direction,” Ferris Stephens, the chairman of the commission, said after the meeting. Pete Conroy, a commission member who has been in favor of keeping PBS programming, said he believes the strong turnout and personal stories help sway the commission. But he cautioned that the issue could resurface. “It will require vigilance. It’s not settled. I think there was a course correction,” Conroy said."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5582647","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Redistricting deadlines for the midterms loom as states wait for a Supreme Court ruling","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2026 midterm elections approach, several U.S. states—particularly in the South—are preparing for a potential Supreme Court ruling that could weaken the Voting Rights Act’s Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in redistricting.

deadlines for the midterms loom as states wait for a Supreme Court ruling \n         By Hansi Lo Wang \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In the congressional gerrymandering fight between Republicans and Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterm election, a number of states are keeping watch for a potential game changer from the U.S. Supreme Court. During the rare rehearing of a Louisiana redistricting case in October, the court's conservative majority  appeared inclined  to weaken the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process. Such a ruling could spark a new wave of congressional redistricting, especially in the South, where voting is often racially polarized and Section 2 has long prevented the dilution of Black minority voters' collective power. Without the current Section 2 protections, Republican-led southern states may undo districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates, who are usually Democrats. This redrawing  could give the GOP a sizable boost , as the party seeks to keep control of the House of Representatives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When the Supreme Court would release its decision is crucial. Time is running out to redo maps, which have to be finalized ahead of a state's filing deadline for candidates seeking to run in a primary election for the midterms. \"The earlier the decision comes, the more likely the decision is before the date for candidates to declare that they're going to be running, and the more time there is for legislatures to meet and consider maps and redraw their maps,\" says Nick Stephanopoulos, a professor specializing in election law at Harvard Law School. The next batch of filing deadlines arrives in December. Still, Stephanopoulos notes these cut-off dates are \"just products of state law.\" \"If a state legislature that's hellbent on gerrymandering wants to do so, it wouldn't be especially surprising if that same legislature delayed the filing deadline, potentially even change the date of the primary election, in order to give themselves enough time to gerrymander,\" Stephanopoulos says. Last month, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature  shifted  the state's  election calendar , pushing its cutoff date for candidate declarations from January to February, and the spring primary from April to May. The change could take advantage of a possible earlier-than-usual decision from the Supreme Court, which typically releases major rulings in June. Louisiana  had asked  the justices for a decision in the state's redistricting case early next year, given the calendar crunch. In Alabama, which has a  January deadline ahead of a May primary election , a Republican state lawmaker is  proposing to allow  a special primary to be held by August if a change to a voting map is \"made at a time too late to be accommodated during the normal primary election schedule.\" There's no definitive list of districts protected by Section 2 Which other states may rush to respond to a weakening of redistricting requirements under the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is hard to predict, says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. To begin with, Li explains, there is no definitive list of Section 2 districts that could be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling because states usually don't explain their reasoning for drawing the boundaries of a voting district the way they do. To come up with a list, \"you'd have to go district by district and do a case-by-case assessment of whether there actually is Section 2 liability or not,\" Li says. And some states may start claiming a district was drawn to get in line with Section 2 even if the law would not have required an opportunity district for racial minority voters. \"It may just be an excuse to get rid of heavily minority districts even if there's not a legal obligation to do so,\" Li adds. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the other hand, some Republican-led states may want to try to keep Section 2 districts that are Democratic-leaning in place. \"There are many places in the country where getting rid of Section 2 districts would make neighboring Republican districts much more competitive. And that may not be what Republicans want,\" Li says. \"It's more efficient for Republicans to have a heavily Black, and thus heavily Democratic, district to sop up as many of these high-turnout Black voters as possible.\" Another wild card amid the ongoing mid-decade gerrymandering fight is how Democratic-led states would react in a redistricting world without Section 2's current requirements. \"If blue states elsewhere observe Republicans massively gerrymandering, flipping 10 to 15 minority-opportunity districts and giving Republicans a big structural advantage in the battle for the U.S. House, I think there's going to be enormous pressure to respond to offset those gerrymanders in blue states,\" says Stephanopoulos at Harvard Law School. \"At this point, the only remaining way to do that is by weakening some of the districts that are now held by minority-preferred candidates in blue states.\" Edited by  Benjamin Swasey \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5612442","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00-05:00","title":"Farewell, fair penny.

You are finished, but never forgotten \n         By L. Carol Ritchie \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 12:30 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Alas, dear penny, you served us well. We picked you up, you gave us luck. We gave you to others in exchange for their thoughts. And remember when we pondered whether dropping you from the Empire State Building could kill a pedestrian? That was fun. (More on that later.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now  you are dead  — but not gone (more on that later, too) — at the wizened age of 232. When polished, you look as young as when you were first minted, but you are worth less to us now, and we've moved on to greater expenses. The nation once used you to pay Union soldiers in the Civil War; now, you barely buy a gumball (and only in bulk!). Like nearly all Americans, you descended from an immigrant, the British penny. Those coins were once so valuable that they were split into halves and even quarters — your late British cousins, the halfpenny and the farthing. In Britain, the coin's history goes back to the time when kings and queens had  names like  Offa   and  Cynethryth  and  Aethelred the Unready , and your name likely traces its lineage from the  German for pan  —  pfanne , for pan, which evolved to  pfennig , for penny. The first one-cent coin in the United States rolled off a private mint in 1787 and wasn't called a penny. It was the fugio cent — fugio for \"fly away\" in Latin,  signifying time flies . The 100% copper coin was inscribed with the surprising words, \"mind your business,\" more a take on \"penny wise, pound foolish\" than an admonition against nosiness. The U.S. minted its first   official penny in 1793. Abraham Lincoln was pictured on the coin starting in 1909, to honor the centennial of his birth, the first time a president's image graced U.S. currency. The words \"In God We Trust\" were added at the same time. Ever the trailblazer, you, the humble penny, were the first to carry those words before Congress added it to all currency and made it the  national motto  almost a half-century later. Now, at just 2.5% copper and the rest zinc, you can't even beat the cost of your own production, according to the U.S. Mint, which says it  took 3.69  of you to make only one more in 2024. Although we shall not meet any new pennies, we know you will hang around for another 30 years or so, because that's the typical  lifespan of a coin , according to the U.S. Treasury. So, luckily for us, we'll still have the perfect coins to put in our penny loafers in the 2050s, when we can expect them to cycle back in style. (In the 1930s, young people put  money in their shoes  for emergency pay phone calls, and thus the  Weejun was born . Maybe someone will design a stylish cellphone shoe before the penny disappears?) Meanwhile, you live on in other ways. We will most certainly celebrate you aphoristically, and this is where the penny drops. We will always be in for a penny, in for a pound. We will proudly trade pennies for thoughts while continuing to give our own two cents' worth. We will still pinch you, because a penny saved is, as ever, a penny earned. We will put a shiny penny in a bride's shoe for luck. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       James Geary, author of  The World in a Phrase: A Brief History of the Aphorism , says the penny is the perfect coin for   these little pearls of wisdom. \"The penny lends itself to aphorisms because they are both small — the aphorism is the shortest form of literature, and the penny is the smallest monetary denomination,\" Geary says. Yes, you are small but mighty. Yet we will never kill anything with you, from the Empire State or any other tall building. Your dimensions — three-quarters of an inch thick and weighing less than a tenth of an ounce — are better  suited to flipping and fluttering in the air  than reaching fatal velocity. As the Mythbusters demonstrated, the penny-drop myth  isn't worth a dime . But, at 10 cents, the dime is at least profitable to mint. Along with the dime, your survivors include the nickel and the quarter. Rest well, sweet penny. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/wicked-for-good-movie-review-23fe7244c429facf27442cbff470f67f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:00:15+00:00","title":"Wicked: For Good Review – A Political Allegory in the Age of Propaganda","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reviews the 2025 film 'Wicked: For Good', a two-part cinematic adaptation of the stage musical, which expands on its political and social themes.

Chu’s two-part musical has asked for quite a bit more than that. Together, the two halves of this “Wicked” adaptation have run 297 minutes, which, more than the threat of lions and tigers and bears, is enough to make any moviegoer not entirely bewitched by the “Wizard of Oz” revision breathe a sigh of “Oh, my.” This image released by Universal Pictures shows Cynthia Erivo, center, in a scene from “Wicked for Good..” (Universal Pictures via AP) This image released by Universal Pictures shows Cynthia Erivo, center, in a scene from “Wicked for Good..” (Universal Pictures via AP) Add AP News on Google Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.

But “Wicked” has always been a spectacle of scale: power ballads and sprawling sets, all in retina-testing technicolor. Muchness is part of the point of “Wicked,” a song-and-dance assault of allegory and anthems relayed with an earnestness that you might call endearing if you’re good or tiresome if you’re, well, you know. READ MORE Ariana Grande and Cher team up for ‘SNL’ in December. Josh O’Connor gets a hosting turn, too What to Stream: ‘Wicked: For Good’ soundtrack, Ted Danson, ‘The Bad Guys 2' and Black cowboys Cynthia Erivo wows crowd with her sunglasses at the ‘Wicked: For Good’ NY premiere For anyone in the former camp who somehow felt last year’s part one wasn’t enough, “For Good” will probably be a very welcoming second helping. Since these films were shot at the same time, much of the tone and tenor of the first chapter continues in “For Good.” There’s more Cynthia Erivo, more Ariana Grande and more soaring soliloquies. For most “Wicked” fans, more is good. But for those of us who felt — what’s a non-wicked way to say this? — mildly waterboarded, in pink and green, by “Wicked,” “For Good” doesn’t offer much relief. There is, to be sure, great talent on display in these films, particularly in the case of Erivo. But “For Good,” like its predecessor, often feels more like a Production than a movie, with characters shuffled on and offstage with Oz-like orchestration. That may be an unavoidable aspect of a pop amalgamation like “Wicked.” This is a big-screen adaptation of a 2003 stage musical (Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz) based on a 1995 book (Gregory Maguire) inspired by a 1939 movie (Victor Fleming and company) and the original 1900 “The Wizard of Oz” by L. Frank Baum. More than a century of American entertainment is packed inside “Wicked.” So, yes, “The Wizard of Oz” is basically history at this point. And that was much of the wit of Maguire’s book, which took Baum’s Oz and imagined that all of its apparent dichotomies — the vilified Wicked Witch of the West, the perfect Glinda the Good Witch, the powerful Wizard — were mere propaganda. If history is a set of falsehoods agreed upon, then Oz, too, is a lie.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Those political metaphors move to the forefront in “For Good.” Having spent much of part one filling in the backstory of Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Grande) as classmates at Shiz University, the second chapter finds Oz in an increasingly agitated state. Elphaba, demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, is now living in exile. “Shield your children,” trumpets the government messaging. “Trust no animals!” While the Yellow Brick Road is laid down, like railroad tracks on the frontier in an industrial haze, the hunt for Elphaba ratchets up. A travel ban is put in effect for animals and Munchkins, alike. Oz, it’s said, is “a place that seems to be devolving.” No one above the age of 10 will fail to miss the target of these references. “Wicked: For Good” isn’t shy about them, and that frankness — and the movie’s ardent belief in empathy and multiculturalism — is both the film’s most stirring and most heavy-handed trait. Each iteration of “Wicked” has come with its own political relevancy. Maguire, himself, was influenced by the drumbeat leading up the Gulf War. “For Good” may be the most pointed and timely interpretation yet. Some of that is woven into the play, and some of it is expanded upon in Holzman’s and Dana Fox’s script, which pads the second act with a little more minor character development and a pair of new songs. The catchiest tunes (“Popular,” Defying Gravity”) are in the rearview, though. Instead, “Wicked: For Good” is all storm clouds and rebellion, as Elphaba mounts a resistance to the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). Characters like Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), captain of the Wizard’s guard, are forced to pick a side.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Considering the source material of the 1939 classic — old Hollywood at the very height of its powers — you would think Oz would come through clearly as a setting, only seen from a different perspective. But despite Chu’s energetic handling of earlier films like “In the Heights” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Wicked: For Good” struggles to really orient us in a place. When Dorothy and Toto drop in (they’re seen only from afar), you almost yearn for the clear pathway they begin skipping down. Instead, “Wicked: For Good,” rather than conjuring Oz anew, always feels like it’s jumping from one set piece to another. Maybe this is a silly gripe for a fantasyland. (“I don’t have any idea where the offices of the Lollipop Guild are!”) But I rarely found myself lifted into a movie world, but rather sat watching it — sometimes with admiration, rarely with delight — from the mezzanine. The rub of going for maximum effect all the time is that the actors never have a chance to simply be. All the momentum that “Wicked: For Good” does gather is owed significantly to its stars. To a large degree, these movies have been the Erivo-and-Grande show, a grand spectacle of female friendship that rises above all the petty biases and misjudgments to forge a vision of harmony in opposites. It’s a compelling vision, and Chu, as he did in the triumphant “Defying Gravity” culmination of part one, knows how to stick the landing. Grande is best at the (too few) comic moments, like a brief impression of Margaret Hamilton’s cackle. But it’s Erivo who really elevates the material. Her Elphaba seems to both believe in the hopeful possibility of “Wicked” and fear its impossibility. When she melancholily sings one of the new songs, “No Place Like Home,” Erivo appears to grasp that it’s going to take more than a click of the heels, or tick of the clock, to get there. “Wicked: For Good,” a Universal Pictures release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/violence, some suggestive material and thematic material.

Bereft of major holidays, all but anonymous, and cold — but not even cold enough to snow (at least in a lot of the U.S.) — it makes a strong claim for the year's least notable day. So spare a bit of pity for Tara Selter. When readers first met the narrator of Danish author Solvej Balle's ongoing septology,  On the Calculation of Volume , Tara was already on her 121st November 18 in a row. That number now stands well north of 1,100 (and counting) as the third installment of this mesmerizing time loop gets its English translation Tuesday. For better or worse, though, her condition isn't catching. Ordinary folks like us only get one swing at this half-digested hairball of a date each year, so we may as well seize the day. Better yet, with new books on the docket from Joy Williams, Simon Winchester and Tracy K. Smith, among other talented writers, we probably ought to stay inside reading until the 19th. On the Calculation of Volume Book III , by Solvej Balle, translated by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell While six of the novels in Balle's seven-volume project have been published so far in the original Danish, this is the third to be translated into English, with the fourth expected in the spring. Don't be misled by the author's modest self-description –  \"just another time-loop story\"  – hers is an ambitious experiment nearly four decades in the making. \"It takes a familiar narrative trope – a protagonist inexplicably stuck in the same day – and transforms it into a profound meditation on love, connectedness and what it means to exist,\" said the judges who put Barbara Haveland's translation of the first volume on the shortlist for  this year's International Booker Prize . The Pelican Child: Stories , by Joy Williams Williams is one of our most accomplished adepts in the art of estrangement — in literally making the mundane  strange . The short stories in her latest collection are spiny little nuggets of jamais vu. Sure, they tend to bear the distinguishing characteristics of the familiar world, with all its stressed assistants and heiresses and bewildered man-children, but they're also moved by some alien inner logic that can be disquietingly difficult to discern. In Williams' hands, reality is a changeling with an occasionally wicked sense of humor. Fear Less: Poetry in Perilous Times , by Tracy K. Smith Speaking to NPR in 2017, Smith explained the human consolations of poetry in an era of disconnection and turmoil: It's \"a voice on a page that's saying, 'I have lived, I have felt, I have questions, and I have wishes.'\" More than eight years later, the former U.S. poet laureate, Pulitzer Prize winner and  onetime NPR NewsPoet  is confronting today's tumultuous moment by listening closer than ever to that voice on the page. In these essays, composed partly of close readings and broad commentary on the possibilities of poetry itself, Smith again proves to be an able ambassador for an artform. The Breath of the Gods: The History and Future of the Wind , by Simon Winchester Winchester, a former reporter, can find a good story just about anywhere he looks, and the range of his gaze is simply enormous. From warzones and Wonderland, to precision engineers, natural disasters and not one but two books about the Oxford English Dictionary, the venerable storyteller has covered a lot of ground in the past half-century. This time, the noted subtitle enthusiast is taking to the air, literally, with a study of the phenomenon that shapes Earth's climate and influences human history.

There would be worse ways to try to understand all its seething complexities than cracking open this multiform portrait of community, disorder and change.

By John Ruwitch \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 6:56 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge on Tuesday handed Meta a victory, ruling against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in an antitrust suit that claimed the social media giant stifled competition and bolstered a monopoly by buying upstart rivals. The  FTC sued Meta five years  ago alleging anti-competitive behavior in what has amounted to the biggest legal challenge yet to one of the world's most influential social media companies. The case followed an investigation that began during the first Trump administration. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Experts say it is part of a series of cases brought by the government to try to rein in \"big tech\" on antitrust grounds, targeting Meta,  Google ,  Amazon  and  Apple . The FTC's suit contended that Facebook, which later became Meta, overpaid to acquire Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 as part of a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate competitors and protect what it alleged is a monopoly in social networking. The FTC argued that the only way to resolve Meta's alleged monopoly power was for the company to be broken up. In legal filings, government lawyers said a judge should order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp into separate companies, to give rivals more room to compete and users more choices. In a memorandum opinion, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote that the FTC had not demonstrated that Meta holds a monopoly in social media. Notably, he wrote that the world of what was once called \"personal social networking\" has changed — giving rise to new competitors and seeing YouTube become a more dominant force. \"Believing that the only constant in the world was change, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus posited that no man can ever step into the same river twice. In the online world of social media, the current runs fast, too,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.\" He noted that two court opinions on motions to dismiss \"did not even mention the word 'TikTok'. Today, that app holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\" FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson said in a statement emailed to NPR that the agency was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and he questioned Boasberg's impartiality. \"The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg,\" he said. Republicans have been unhappy with Boasberg, who has presided over deportation-related  cases  and issued  rulings  that the Trump administration has opposed. Trump has  referred to him  as a \"Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge\" and called for his impeachment, which several conservative members of Congress are pursuing. In an emailed statement to NPR, Meta's Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead welcomed Boasberg's decision in the antitrust case. \"The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition. Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" Newstead wrote. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       During the trial , which ended in May, Meta's lawyers argued that the company faces ample competition and that it bought Instagram and WhatsApp because they were good products. Its attorneys argued that federal authorities were attempting to punish the company for its success, noting that regulators approved both takeovers at the time. In court, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg  was peppered  with questions about his motives for pursuing the acquisitions. Asked about Instagram, he told the court he was impressed with Instagram's product and decided it was better to buy the app than invest in building one in-house. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Bill Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University's law school and former chairman of the FTC, said the outcome was a decisive victory for Meta. He noted that it comes on the heels of a remedy  ruling  in the Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google. Although a federal judge ruled that Google  held a monopoly in internet search , Kovacic said, some observers saw the punishment as soft after the judge declined to force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Antitrust lawsuits may not be helpful ways to put guardrails around big, fast-moving tech companies, Kovacic said. \"Those two data points might suggest to you this is the wrong methodology.\"  He said there may now be renewed debate about the need for fresh regulations to keep tech companies in line when it comes to competitive behavior as well as things like user safety and security.  \"We see an interesting alliance on the left and the right hand side of the political spectrum in Congress, saying that big tech does present a serious question about control, behavior and oversight,\" he said. \"There seems to be a coalition that's willing to take some measures, although finding common cause about a specific program seems to have been elusive.\" Legal watchers had previously noted that Zuckerberg and Meta had made efforts during Trump's second term to thaw his notoriously frosty relationship with the president — and speculated that it might prompt Trump to push the FTC to settle the suit. Trump had sued Meta after his social media accounts were suspended in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. This January, Meta paid  $25 million to settle  that lawsuit. The same month, Meta also  ended its fact-checking program , which some conservative critics had alleged was biased and a form of censorship. Meta  donated $1 million  to the president's inauguration fund. The Wall Street Journal   reported  in April that Zuckerberg's efforts to settle with the FTC were rebuffed. It is unclear if the government will appeal. The FTC's Simonson said the commission was \"reviewing all our options.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/australia-prison-vegemite-ban-court-victoria-e46084defadc9757c8ecf2f53027d215","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:10:05+00:00","title":"Prisoner Sues Victorian Prison System Over Ban on Vegemite","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andre McKechnie, a 54-year-old prisoner serving a life sentence for the 1994 murder of property developer Otto Kuhne, has launched a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria against the ban on Vegemite in Victorian prisons, claiming it violates his human right to 'enjoy his culture as an Australian' under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act.

— A prisoner is challenging an Australian state’s ban on inmates eating Vegemite , claiming in a lawsuit that withholding the polarizing yeast-based spread breaches his human right to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.” Andre McKechnie, 54, serving a life sentence for murder, took his battle for the salty, sticky, brown byproduct of brewing beer to the Supreme Court of Victoria, according to documents released to The Associated Press on Tuesday. Most Australians revere Vegemite as an unfairly maligned culinary icon, and more than 80% of Australian households are estimated to have a jar in their pantries. But inmates in all 12 prisons in Victoria are going without. McKechnie is suing Victoria’s Department of Justice and Community Safety and the agency that manages the prisons, Corrections Victoria. The case is scheduled for trial next year. Challenging the ban Vegemite has been banned from Victorian prisons since 2006, with Corrections Victoria saying it “interferes with narcotic detection dogs.” Inmates used to smear packages of illicit drugs with Vegemite in the hope that the odor would distract the dogs from the contraband. Vegemite also contains yeast, which is banned from Victorian prisons because of its “potential to be used in the production of alcohol,” the contraband list says. A decade ago, Vegemite’s then-U.S. owner, Mondelez International, rejected media reports that remote Australian Indigenous communities were using Vegemite to brew alcohol in bathtubs. Mondelez said in a statement the manufacturing process killed the yeast and that “Vegemite cannot be fermented into alcohol.” McKechnie is seeking a court declaration that the defendants denied him his right under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.” The Act guarantees “All persons with a particular cultural, religious, racial or linguistic background” the right to “enjoy their culture, to declare and practice their religion and to use their language.” He also wants a declaration that the defendants breached the Corrections Act by “failing to provide food adequate to maintain” McKechnie’s “well-being.” The Australian favorite Manufactured in Australia since 1923 as an alternative to Britain’s Marmite, Vegemite was long marketed as a source of vitamin B for growing children. The spread is beloved by a majority of Australians, but typically considered an acquired taste at best by those who weren’t raised on it. The last U.S. president to visit Australia, Barack Obama , once said: “It’s horrible.” Australian band Men at Work aroused international curiosity when they mentioned a “Vegemite sandwich” in their 1980s hit “Down Under.” The band’s lead singer, Colin Hay, once accused American critics of laying Vegemite on too thick, blaming a “more is more” U.S. culture. It’s a favorite on breakfast toast and in cheese sandwiches, with most fans agreeing it’s best applied sparingly. Australian travelers bemoan Vegemite’s scarcity overseas. The Australian government intervened in April when Canadian officials temporarily prevented a Toronto-based cafe from selling Vegemite in jars and on toast in a dispute media branded as “Vegemite-gate.” The Canadians relented and allowed the product to be sold despite its failure to comply with local regulations dealing with food packaging and vitamin fortification. The Department of Justice and Community Safety and Corrections Victoria declined to comment Tuesday. Government agencies generally maintain it is not appropriate to comment on issues that are before the courts. Prisons in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania states and the Australian Capital Territory also ban Vegemite. But Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, does not. Other Australian jurisdictions, Western Australia state and the Northern Territory, had yet to tell AP where they stand on the spread. Victims of crime criticize Vegemite lawsuit Victims of crime advocate and lawyer John Herron said it was a frivolous lawsuit that was offensive to victims’ families. “As victims, we don’t have any rights. We have limited, if any, support. It’s always about the perpetrator, and this just reinforces that,” said Herron, whose daughter Courtney Herron was beaten to death in a Melbourne park in 2019. Her killer was found not guilty of murder by reason of mental impairment. “It’s not a case of Vegemite or Nutella or whatever it may be. It’s an extra perk that is rubbing our faces in the tragedy that we’ve suffered,” Herron added. McKechnie is held at maximum-security Port Phillip Prison. He was 23 years old when he stabbed to death wealthy Gold Coast property developer Otto Kuhne in Queensland in 1994. He was sentenced to life for murder and transferred a decade later from the Queensland to the Victorian prison system. McKechnie’s lawyers didn’t respond to a request for comment."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/japan-oita-kyushu-fire-431f48b937f47143f28edac20796a0cb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"20:07:30+00:00","title":"Fire Forces Evacuation in Oita, Japan, as Homes Burn in Out-of-Control Blaze","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wildfire broke out in Oita, a city on the southern island of Kyushu, Japan, during strong winds on Tuesday evening.

interconnection system under the terms of a court settlement with the federal government’s steward of funding for public broadcasting stations. The settlement, announced late Monday, partially resolves a legal dispute in which NPR accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of bowing to pressure from President Donald Trump to cut off its funding. On March 25, Trump said at a news conference that he would “love to” defund NPR and PBS because he believes they are biased in favor of Democrats. NPR accused the CPB of violating its First Amendment free speech rights when it moved to cut off its access to grant money appropriated by Congress. NPR also claims Trump, a Republican, wants to punish it for the content of its journalism. On April 2, the CPB’s board initially approved a three-year, roughly $36 million extension of a grant for NPR to operate the “interconnection” satellite system for public radio.

The settlement doesn’t end a lawsuit in which NPR seeks to block any implementation or enforcement of Trump’s executive order. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss is scheduled to preside over another hearing for the case on Dec. 4. The settlement says NPR and CPB agree that the executive order is unconstitutional and that CPB won’t enforce it unless a court orders it to do so. NPR, meanwhile, agreed to drop its request for a court order blocking CPB from disbursing funds to PMI under a separate grant agreement. Katherine Maher, NPR’s president and CEO, said the settlement is “a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system.” Patricia Harrison, the corporation’s CEO, said CPB is pleased that the litigation is over “and that our investment in the future through PMI marks an exciting new era for public media.” On Aug. 1, CPB announced it would take steps toward closing itself down after being defunded by Congress."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-trump-11-18-2025-b4cc39532d7f100299ff3aa23c2143f1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:37:27+00:00","title":"Palestinian Attack in West Bank Kills Israeli, Wounds Three; U.N.

The attack follows a spate of settler violence against Palestinians across the West Bank. Officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio , have warned that such unrest could spill over and undermine the fragile truce in Gaza. It came a day after the U.N. Security Council gave its backing to U.S. President Donald Trump’s blueprint to secure and govern Gaza . Hamas rejected the plan as other countries signaled excitement and readiness to help implement it. Violence flares in the West Bank The Israeli military said the stabbing took place at the Gush Etzion junction south of Jerusalem, a site of many past attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel’s emergency rescue services said a 71-year-old man died of stab wounds at the scene. Three other people were hospitalized, including a woman in serious condition and a teenager in moderate condition. The military said Israeli troops then opened fire, killing two Palestinian attackers. The Palestinian Health Ministry later identified them as two 18-year-olds from the Hebron area.

Hamas did not claim responsibility for the attack, but in a statement called it “a normal response to the occupation’s attempts to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” vowing that Israeli aggression wouldn’t go unchallenged. Elsewhere in the West Bank on Tuesday, news network Al Jazeera’s local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, said Israeli forces shot cameraman Fadi Yassin in both legs while he was covering a protest in the city of Tulkarem. The military did not respond to a request for comment. Tulkarem has been a flashpoint throughout the year, with Israeli forces frequently carrying out incursions around the Nur Shams refugee camp, which they say is home to many militants. Civilians say the area has endured repeated raids, sieges and home demolitions, prompting regular protests by Palestinians angry about operations pushing people from their homes An Associated Press journalist saw soldiers fire into the air to disperse protesters and then shoot toward Yassin as he moved toward the camp entrance to film. The journalist later saw Yassin on the ground, injured and surrounded by Palestinians, including women and children, before he was carried by bystanders to an ambulance. The violence came a day after Israeli settlers rampaged through the Palestinian village of al-Jab’a, torching homes and cars, drawing a rare condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli leaders. World reacts to UN vote The United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority praised the U.N. vote on Trump’s postwar Gaza plan. Hamas rejected it, saying the proposed security force would only help Israel maintain its grip on the territory. The resolution provides a wide mandate for an international force to provide security in war-devastated Gaza, approves a transitional authority called the Board of Peace to be overseen by Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu, who otherwise applauded the resolution, did not mention the pathway to statehood in remarks about the plans. The plan calls for the stabilization force to ensure “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” It authorizes the force “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate” in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force. Hamas said Monday that the force’s mandate, including disarmament, “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” It said the resolution did not “meet the level of our Palestinian people’s political and humanitarian demands and rights.” Hamas demanded that any international force be under U.N. supervision, deploy only at Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and operate exclusively with Palestinian institutions. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza’s fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas’ surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive since then has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. European Union to discuss Gaza reconstruction aid The European Union announced Tuesday it will host a conference on Thursday for a new Palestinian donors group to discuss financial aid for Gaza’s reconstruction, reforms of the Palestinian Authority and long-term peace in the Middle East. The EU has pledged in the past to help train police officers in Gaza and flood the war-torn coastal enclave with humanitarian aid. European Commission spokesperson Guillaume Mercier said delegations from 60 entities, including the EU’s 27 member states, some unnamed financial institutions, international organizations and other countries, would meet in Brussels. The meeting is to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. Another Commission spokesperson, Anouar El Anouni, said the U.N. Security Council resolution “provides the basis for moving into the next phase, including work related to the International Stabilization Force and the Board of Peace.” U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Tuesday that the international community needed to “work together to take forward the 20-point plan and to turn it into a just and lasting peace.” Cooper called for “urgent action to open all the crossings, lift restrictions and flood Gaza with aid.” More on the US proposal Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with “many more exciting announcements.” The plan calls for the stabilization troops to secure Gaza border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted. The force will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance , and should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel. As the international force establishes control, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization.” These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says. ___ Associated Press writers Edith M.

When a small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a petition in July to maneuver around Speaker Mike Johnson’s control of the House floor, it appeared a longshot effort — especially as Trump urged his supporters to dismiss the matter as a “hoax.” But both Trump and Johnson failed to prevent the vote. The president in recent days bowed to political reality, saying he would sign the bill. And just hours after the House vote, senators agreed to approve it unanimously, skipping a formal roll call.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More For survivors of Epstein’s abuse, passage of the bill was a watershed moment in a years-long quest for accountability. “These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as she stood with some of the abuse survivors outside the Capitol Tuesday morning. “That’s what we did by fighting so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today,” added Greene, a Georgia Republican. In the end, only one lawmaker in Congress opposed the bill. Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican who is a fervent supporter of Trump, was the only “nay” vote in the House’s 427-1 tally. He said he worried the legislation could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation. The bill forces the release within 30 days of all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in federal prison. It would allow the Justice Department to redact information about Epstein’s victims or continuing federal investigations, but not information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.” Even before the bill’s passage Tuesday, thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein’s estate have been released from an investigation by the House Oversight Committee. Those documents show Epstein’s connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein. Trump’s reversal on the Epstein files Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, but tried for months to move past the demands for disclosure. Still, many in the Republican base continued to demand the release of the files. Adding to that pressure, survivors of Epstein’s abuse rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday morning. Bundled in jackets against the November chill and holding photos of themselves as teenagers, they recounted their stories of abuse. “We are exhausted from surviving the trauma and then surviving the politics that swirl around it,” said one of the survivors. Another, Jena-Lisa Jones, said she had voted for Trump and had a message for the president: “I beg you Donald Trump, please stop making this political.” The group of women also met with Johnson and rallied outside the Capitol in September , but have had to wait months for the vote. That’s because Johnson kept the House closed for legislative business for nearly two months and refused to swear-in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona during the government shutdown. After winning a special election on Sept. 23, Grijalva had pledged to provide the crucial 218th vote to the petition for the Epstein files bill. But only after she was sworn into office last week could she sign her name to the discharge petition to give it majority support in the 435-member House. It quickly became obvious the bill would pass, and both Johnson and Trump began to fold. Trump on Sunday said Republicans should vote for the bill. Yet Greene told reporters that Trump’s decision to fight the bill had betrayed his Make America Great Again political movement. “Watching this turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,” she said. How Johnson handled the bill Rather than waiting until next week for the discharge position to officially take effect, Johnson held the vote under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority. But Johnson also spent a morning news conference listing off problems that he sees with the legislation. He argued that the bill could have unintended consequences by disclosing parts of federal investigations that are usually kept private, including information on victims. “This is a raw and obvious political exercise,” Johnson said. Still, he voted for the bill. “None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” he explained.

Despite U.S. intelligence findings suggesting Crown Prince bin Salman likely approved the killing, Trump dismissed the report and defended the crown prince, claiming he knew nothing about it. The two leaders signed new defense agreements, including a sale of F-35 fighter jets and 300 tanks, and formalized Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally. The visit also coincided with Saudi Arabia's announcement of a $1 trillion investment in the U.S., up from $600 billion, and marked Trump’s effort to push Saudi Arabia toward normalizing relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. However, human rights groups and activists criticized Trump for downplaying the Khashoggi case and for his family’s business interests in Saudi Arabia, including the planned Trump Plaza in Jeddah.

Tuesday dismissed U.S. intelligence findings that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman likely had some culpability in the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi as Trump warmly welcomed the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia on his first White House visit in seven years. The U.S.-Saudi relationship had, for a time, been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom. But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump is tightening his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince, who he said is an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Trump in his defense of the crown prince derided Khashoggi as “extremely controversial” and said “a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman.” Prince Mohammed denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, who was a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident. “Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen,” Trump said when asked about the killing by a reporter during an Oval Office appearance with Prince Mohammed. “But (Prince Mohammed) knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.” Related Stories Democratic state election officials demand answers on Justice Department’s requests for voter data 4 MIN READ Bipartisan bill aims to pay air traffic controllers during future shutdowns 4 MIN READ What to know about the F-35 fighter jet that Trump is selling to Saudi Arabia 4 MIN READ But U.S. intelligence officials determined that the Saudi crown prince likely approved the killing by Saudi agents of U.S.-based journalist inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul , according to U.S. findings declassified in 2021 at the start of the Biden administration. Trump officials, during his first administration, refused to release the report. Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia “did all the right steps” to investigate Khashoggi’s death. “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” he said. Trump, who said the two leaders have become “good friends,” even commended the Saudi leader for strides made by the kingdom on human rights without providing any specific detail. New investment from Saudis The crown prince for his part announced Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investments in the U.S. to $1 trillion, up from $600 billion that the Saudis announced they would pour into the United States when Trump visited the kingdom in May.

It’s also about long-term opportunity,” Prince Mohammed said. Trump’s family has a strong personal interest in the kingdom. In September, London real estate developer Dar Global announced that it plans to launch Trump Plaza in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. It’s Dar Global’s second collaboration with the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the U.S. president’s children, in Saudi Arabia. Trump pushed back on suggestions that there could be a conflict of interest in his family’s dealings with the Saudis. “I have nothing to do with the family business,” Trump said. Trump’s comments about Khashoggi’s killing and defense of his family’s business in Saudi Arabia were blasted by human rights and government oversight activists. Human rights groups say Saudi authorities continue to harshly repress dissent, including by arresting human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents for criticism against the kingdom. They also note a surge in executions in Saudi Arabia that they connect to an effort to suppress internal dissent. “President Trump has Jamal Khashoggi’s blood on his hands,” said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director for DAWN, a U.S.-based group advocating for democracy and human rights in the Arab world that was founded by Khashoggi. Rolling out the red carpet Trump warmly received Prince Mohammed when he arrived at the White House Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony that included a military flyover and a thundering greeting from the U.S. Marine band. Technically, it wasn’t a state visit, because the crown prince is not the head of state. But Prince Mohammed has taken charge of the day-to-day governing for his father, King Salman, 89, who has endured health problems in recent years. Later, Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcomed the crown prince for a black-tie dinner in the White House East Room. The boldface names who attended included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Trump at the dinner announced he was designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally. The designation, while largely symbolic, provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense, trade and security cooperation.

Ahead of the visit, the Saudis had signaled they were looking for formal assurances from Trump defining the scope of the U.S. military protection for the kingdom. “A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries,” Trump said. “And it will serve the highest interest of peace.” Fighter jets and business deals On the eve of Prince Mohammed’s arrival, Trump announced he had agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system. The White House announced the two leaders formalized the F-35 agreement Tuesday as well as a deal for the Saudis to purchase nearly 300 tanks from the U.S. They also signed agreements signifying closer cooperation on capital markets and critical minerals markets, as well as efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. Trump’s announcement on the fighter jets was surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel’s qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan . Abraham Accord talks The visit comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel. The president in his first term had helped forge commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates through an effort dubbed the Abraham Accords .

The Israelis remain steadfastly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. “We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of a two-state solution,” Prince Mohammed said. ___ AP writers Josh Boak, Fatima Hussein, Seung Min Kim, Michelle L.

2025-11-18T05:39:03+00:00\n\nBELEM, Brazil (AP) — As United Nations climate talks bubble to a critical point, negotiators on Tuesday were pressured to ensure that oil — along with fossil fuels coal and natural gas — won’t be burned in the future. Although the conference, known as COP30, is scheduled to run through Friday, the Brazilian presidency is pushing for an interconnected decision sooner on four issues that weren’t originally on the agenda. Meanwhile, dozens of nations — rich and poor — banded together in a concerted call to deliver a detailed road map for the world to phase out or transition away from fossil fuels . Former Ireland President Mary Robinson , a fierce climate advocate, was unusually optimistic Tuesday, comparing the talks in Belem, on the edge of the Amazon, to the climate talks that produced the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement that set a target for limiting Earth’s warming. “This COP reminds me of Paris very much,” Robinson told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. “I’m hoping for as good an outcome out of this difficult environment as possible. We can get it, you know, we can get it.” Wednesday is the big day Much of it will come to a head on Wednesday, the deadline set by COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago for a decision on four issues that were initially excluded from the official agenda: whether countries should be told to toughen their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate and improving reporting on transparency and climate progress.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will return to the talks on Wednesday and meet with some of the negotiating teams, do Lago said. The issue that’s getting talked about by more than 80 nations is weaning the world from fossil fuels. Two years ago, after much debate, the U.N. climate talks in Dubai agreed on language for a “transition away from fossil fuels.” But the following year the issue disappeared from view. Now, many — but not all — countries are pushing for a detailed road map that would essentially give directions on how to phase out fossil fuels. “People around the world are mobilizing on a massive scale, demanding concrete action for climate justice, particularly against the expansion of fossil fuel,” said Colombia’s Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres. “Our categorical decision backed by science and by people has been to phase out fossil fuels. Despite being a producer country of oil and coal, we have chosen not to grant any new oil exploration contracts, nor any new coal mining titles.” “We have to leave here with a call for a road map,” she said Tuesday. “There’s no other way.” Ed Miliband, secretary of state for energy and climate Change of the United Kingdom, speaks during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Ed Miliband, the United Kingdom’s top official for energy and climate change, said the issue has united the Global South and North, “saying with one voice that this is an issue that cannot be ignored, cannot be swept under the carpet, and this is where the momentum is.” The COP presidency’s draft language on the phaseout road map caused strong positive and negative reactions, with perhaps more negative reactions than strong, said COP30 CEO Ana Toni. She said not only were fossil fuel nations against it, but other countries didn’t want something that would be seen as added requirements. U.S. President Donald Trump, who didn’t send anyone to the conference, has called climate change a scam. But do Lago raised one interesting possibility. Usually agreements coming out of COPs have to be by consensus and near unanimous. But he said since the idea of a fossil fuel transition was already approved by consensus in 2023, the road map may not need such a high bar for adoption. A draft to work from Do Lago kicked off Tuesday’s action with a proposal that had 21 options for negotiators on four sticky and interrelated issues. While the options in the draft text “are a first step, what’s required now is to eliminate the options that add to delay and ignore the urgency of action,” said Jasper Inventor, deputy program director of Greenpeace International. Tuesday was also a day for speeches from high-level ministers. Sophie Hermans, the Netherlands’ deputy prime minister, said “the transition is no longer about setting targets. It is about executing them. And execution requires realism, planning and the ability to adjust when circumstances change.” Pressure grows to reach an agreement The documents ask leaders to hash out many aspects of a potential agreement by Wednesday so that much is out of the way before the final set of decisions Friday, when the conference is scheduled to end. Climate summits routinely go past their last day as nations have to balance domestic concerns with the major shifts needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Lula was scheduled to return to Belem on Wednesday and the deadline may be timed for him to push parties together or celebrate some kind of draft agreement, observers said.

fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty\n\nThe expansion of  fossil fuel infrastructure  is threatening billions of lives around the globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/congress-passes-bill-to-release-epstein-files-sending-measure-to-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"23:48:36Z","title":"Congress passes bill to release ‘Epstein files’, sending measure to Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress passed a bipartisan bill to release government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender with ties to high-profile figures such as Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Ehud Barak.

to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, clearing the way for making the files public.\n\nThe House of Representatives adopted the measure in a 427-1 vote on Tuesday, sending it to the Senate, which swiftly agreed to pass it by unanimous consent even before it was formally transmitted to the chamber.\n\nOnce the bill is formally approved, it will go to the desk of President Donald Trump, who said he would sign it into law.\n\nThe case of Epstein – a financier who sexually abused girls and young women for years – has sparked intrigue in the US for years, given his connections to powerful people in the media, politics and academia, including  ties to Trump .\n\nTrump initially opposed releasing the files, calling the controversy around the late sex offender a “hoax” before  reversing course  this month.\n\nThe president and his Department of Justice do not need to wait for Congress to pass the legislation to release the files. They have the authority to make them public.\n\nBefore the vote on Tuesday, members of Congress who have been leading the bill – Democrat Ro Khanna and Republicans Thomas Massie and  Marjorie Taylor Greene  – spoke alongside survivors of Epstein’s abuse outside the US Capitol.\n\n“We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win. They’re on our side today, so let’s give them some credit as well,” Massie told reporters.\n\nJena-Lisa Jones, one of the survivors, held up a photo of herself when she was 14 – the age when she met Epstein.\n\n“I was a child. I was in ninth grade. I was hopeful for life and what the future had held for me. He stole a lot from me,” she said.\n\nEpstein first pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution with a minor in 2008. He served 13 months in a minimum-security prison and was allowed to leave for 12 hours a day to work. Critics said the punishment did not match the severity of the offence.\n\nAfter the Miami Herald investigated the prosecution against Epstein, federal authorities reopened the case against him, arrested him and charged him with sex trafficking of minors in 2019.\n\nTwo months later, he was found dead in his jail cell in New York City. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nEpstein’s associates over the years included former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the United Kingdom’s  Prince Andrew  and former US President Bill Clinton.\n\nEven after his first conviction, Epstein continued to have close personal relationships with influential figures, including former Harvard University President Larry Summers, who  recently apologised  for maintaining ties to the sex offender.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump lashed out at an ABC News reporter who quizzed him about why he would not release the files on his own, stressing that Epstein was a major donor for Democratic politicians.\n\n“You just keep going on the Epstein files. And what the Epstein is is a Democrat hoax,” the US president said.\n\nEarlier in the day when asked why Trump would not make the documents public, Massie said Epstein’s connections were above partisan politics.\n\n“I believe he’s trying to protect friends and donors. And by the way, these aren’t necessarily Republicans,” Massie said. “Once you get to a billion dollars, you see, you transcend parties.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/britains-mi5-warns-lawmakers-over-chinese-spies-posing-as-headhunters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"21:21:00+00:00","title":"Britain’s MI5 warns lawmakers over Chinese spies posing as ‘headhunters’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"MI5 has issued a warning to UK lawmakers and universities about Chinese espionage operations, including spies posing as headhunters who are targeting MPs and academic institutions through digital outreach, such as LinkedIn.

stop its “self-aggrandisement”.\n\n“We urge the UK side to immediately stop this self-staged charade of false accusations and self-aggrandisement, and stop going further down the wrong path of

parliament (MPs) for China, saying the British government had not provided clear evidence to show that Beijing was a threat to its national security.\n\nThe collapse of the case led to accusations from opposition politicians that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was prioritising better relations with Beijing over national security. The government denies the claims.\n\nThe warning also comes just weeks before the government must decide whether to approve a massive new Chinese embassy in London that critics say will pose a security risk.\n\nLast year, the United Kingdom  banned a Chinese businessman  with alleged links to then-Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, from entering the country, saying the alleged spy posed a national security risk.\n\nThe man had reportedly become a “close confidant” of scandal-hit  Andrew  and was invited to royal residences, such as Buckingham Palace.

2025-11-11T14:15:46+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Canada has lost its measles “elimination” status, which, by default, has caused the overall Americas region to lose its status as well.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the country’s Public Health Agency stated that Canada was experiencing a “large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak of measles” which began in October last year.\n\nOver the past year, the agency has recorded cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/landslides-kill-dozens-as-heavy-rains-lash-southeast-asia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:57+00:00","title":"Landslides kill dozens as heavy rains lash Southeast Asia","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Landslides in Indonesia and Vietnam have killed dozens of people due to heavy rainfall during the rainy season, with at least 18 deaths in Indonesia—primarily in Central Java and Papua—and six in Vietnam after a bus was crushed on Khanh Le Pass.

Under the  terms of the ceasefire  signed on November 27, 2024, Israel was meant to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon by January 26, a deadline it missed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39+00:00","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a dire water crisis due to six consecutive years of drought, with precipitation levels down 81% from historical averages.

feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/hamas-gaza-factions-say-un-resolution-undermines-national-will","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:56:19+00:00","title":"Hamas, Gaza factions say UN resolution undermines ‘national will’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza have rejected a United Nations Security Council resolution that proposes an international governing board and military force in Gaza, arguing it violates the Palestinian national will and replaces self-rule with imposed foreign administration.

in Gaza have rejected a  United Nations Security Council resolution  that establishes a governing board and an international stabilisation force to take over the Israeli-besieged enclave.\n\nIn a joint statement released on Tuesday, Hamas and other factions in Gaza said the United States-led effort will act as a framework “that paves the way for field arrangements imposed outside the Palestinian national will”.\n\nThey said that in its current proposed form, the international military force to be deployed in Gaza “will turn into a type of imposed guardianship or administration – reproducing a reality that restricts the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and to managing their own affairs”.\n\nThe factions said the plan headed by US President Donald Trump and backed by a number of Arab states in the region represents a “form of deep international partnership in the war of extermination waged by the [Israeli] occupation against our people”.\n\nThe resolution also ignores the daily attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers across the occupied West Bank, and pays no attention to root causes like ending  Israeli occupation and apartheid , Hamas and the other groups said.\n\nWhile Palestinians in Gaza rejoiced at the announcement of the October 10 ceasefire as it brought hopes they would be spared from more intense daily bombardment and hunger, some residents were sceptical about the UN resolution.\n\n“I completely reject this decision,” Moamen Abdul-Malek, a resident of Gaza City, told Al Jazeera. “Our people … are able to rule ourselves. We don’t need forces from Arab or foreign countries to rule us. We are the people of this country, and we will bear responsibility for it.”\n\nMohammed Hamdan – another resident of Gaza’s biggest urban centre, which was badly destroyed in Israel’s two-year war – said he also believes the Trump plan was not in the interests of Palestinians.\n\n“It would strip the resistance of its weapons, despite the fact that resistance is a legitimate right of peoples under occupation.”\n\nSanaa Mahmoud Kaheel said Palestinians rejected the decision, which would bring uncertainty to Gaza.\n\n“They initially said the Palestinian Authority would take control of the Gaza Strip, and we were enthusiastic about that. But things will be unclear with the international forces, and we do not know what might happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with them being in Gaza,” she said.\n\nThe UN Security Council resolution’s  lack of guarantee for an independent Palestinian state  leaves “a good deal of cause for concern”, said Mohamad Elmasry, a professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that no “meaningful path forward” towards Palestinian statehood had been established.\n\nSome Israeli politicians fumed at the resolution, even as the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement thanked Trump, who is expected to be appointed as the head of the so-called “board of peace” that is to govern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said if the resolution does anything to further prospects of a future sovereign Palestinian state, senior officials with the Palestinian Authority  must be assassinated , and President Mahmoud Abbas must be imprisoned.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, said it welcomed the resolution and was ready to implement it.\n\nIn ravaged Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli air strikes targeted areas beyond the so-called yellow line, demarcating territory under Israeli military control, east of Khan Younis, while raids and demolition operations were carried out east of Gaza City.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry has confirmed that nearly 70,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 170,000 wounded as a result of Israeli attacks since the start of the war in October 2023."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/not-going-to-happen-sheinbaum-dismisses-trump-threat-of-mexico-strikes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:21:36+00:00","title":"‘Not going to happen’: Sheinbaum dismisses Trump threat of Mexico strikes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected any U.S. military intervention in Mexico, dismissing President Donald Trump’s repeated threats of launching strikes against land-based drug cartels.

Trump threat of Mexico strikes\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has once again rejected the prospect of United States military intervention on her country’s soil, despite increasing threats from her counterpart, Donald Trump.\n\nIn her morning news conference on Tuesday, Sheinbaum was asked about Trump’s statements a day prior, when he expressed displeasure with Mexico and mused about taking forceful action.\n\n“It’s not going to happen,” Sheinbaum replied in Spanish.\n\nShe proceeded to explain that she had made her position clear “many times” in telephone conversations with Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio.\n\n“He has suggested on several occasions or has said, ‘We offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico or whatever you need to combat criminal groups,'” she explained.\n\nWhile she said she would accept collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the US military, she repeated her stance that no outside intervention would be allowed on Mexican soil.\n\n“We do not accept an intervention by any foreign government,” Sheinbaum continued. “I’ve told him on the phone. I’ve said it with the State Department, with Marco Rubio.”\n\nHer comments come on the heels of an Oval Office meeting between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday. The Republican president used the public appearance to address his expanding military campaign against drug cartels and criminal networks in Latin America.\n\nWhen a reporter asked if he was considering “potentially launching strikes in Mexico”, Trump answered in the affirmative.\n\n“To stop drugs? It’s OK with me.  Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said. “I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. This is some big problems over there.”\n\nHe then made a reference to the US bombing campaign that began on September 2.\n\nAt least 21 deadly missile strikes have been conducted against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 83 people.\n\nUnited Nations officials and other legal experts have denounced the military campaign as an illegal form of extrajudicial killing.\n\nTrump, however, suggested the campaign could eventually include strikes on land-based targets in Mexico.\n\n“ If we had to, would we do there what we’ve done to the waterways? You know, there’s almost no drugs coming into our waterways any more,” Trump continued.\n\n“ Would I do that on the land corridors? I would absolutely. Look, every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives, not to mention the destruction of families.”\n\nWhile Trump has repeatedly used that number — 25,000 — to justify the boat bombing campaign, there is no factual basis for that figure.\n\nProvisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that fatal drug overdoses have declined in recent years, with 73,960 deaths recorded during the 12-month period ending in April.\n\nThe Trump administration has also provided no definitive evidence to prove who was on board the bombed vessels, nor that they were linked to drug trafficking.\n\nThe identities of the victims remain largely unknown, though families in countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have asserted that their loved ones disappeared after the attacks. Some have claimed their relatives were only fishermen.\n\nTwo survivors were repatriated in October, one to Colombia and another to Ecuador, the latter of which released the man without charging him with a crime.\n\nTrump has long threatened to broaden his bombing campaign to include land-based targets. But he declined to say whether he would ask permission before striking Mexico, should he choose to do so.\n\n“ I wouldn’t answer that question,” he told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday. “I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand.”\n\nHe later added, “ Let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico.”\n\nSince taking office for a second term, Trump has claimed extraordinary powers to justify his increasingly aggressive actions against drug cartels, going so far as to claim the US is in a state of war with traffickers.\n\nOnly Congress can formally declare war in the US. But in August, Trump reportedly  signed a secret order  allowing the military to take action against the cartels, leading to renewed fears in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum, at the time, told her constituents there would be “no invasion”.\n\nThen, on October 2, Trump  issued a memo  to Congress asserting that Latin American cartels were “enemy combatants” in a “non-international armed conflict”, laying out his administration’s legal argument for the ongoing attacks in the Caribbean and Pacific.\n\nTrump has also categorised various drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” throughout his second term, though that designation alone does not justify military action under international and domestic law.\n\nIn Monday’s Oval Office remarks, Trump reiterated his position that he viewed the US as being in an armed conflict.\n\n“ We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war,” Trump said.\n\nThe US has a long and controversial history of military intervention in Latin America, and in recent years, there has been renewed interest on the US right to send armed forces into Mexico.\n\nIn 2023, for example, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, a prominent Republican leader, said he would deploy US special forces across the border to Mexico to fight drug-trafficking cartels.\n\n“And I will do it on day one,” DeSantis told Fox News at the time, musing on his plans for the presidency.\n\nFears that Trump could spearhead such an action stretch back to his first term, from 2017 to 2021, when he first considered using the “foreign terrorist organisation” designation.\n\nThen-Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum’s predecessor,  likewise had to quell concerns  that Trump would pursue foreign intervention as a result.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheinbaum echoed Lopez Obrador and denied that any US intervention was on the table.\n\n“There is collaboration, and there is coordination,” Sheinbaum replied. “But there is no subordination, nor can we allow an intervention.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/trump-hosts-saudi-arabias-mohammed-bin-salman-five-key-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"21:36:17+00:00","title":"Trump hosts Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman: Five key takeaways","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a high-profile visit to the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with US President Donald Trump, marking a significant deepening of US-Saudi strategic ties.

Salman has received a warm welcome to the White House from United States President  Donald Trump  in a visit that has emphasised the deepening ties between Riyadh and Washington.\n\nThe White House rolled the literal red carpet out for Prince Mohammed, known as MBS, on Tuesday.  Trump greeted him with a ceremony that featured marching bands, flag-carrying horsemen and a military flyover.\n\nThe opulent display of hospitality signalled Trump’s embrace of what he sees as a new Middle East driven by financial investments and US partnerships with allies in the region, chiefly Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter Prince Mohammed’s arrival through the South Portico, he and Trump took questions from journalists in the Oval Office. The two leaders spoke of business opportunities, peace, artificial intelligence and the tech business.\n\nThe Trump-MBS meeting also led to major announcements, including in the already strong defence relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the meeting:\n\nIn recent months, Trump has repeatedly said he would like Saudi Arabia to join the so-called  Abraham Accords , which established formal relations between Israel and several Arab countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prince Mohammed and Trump signalled possible progress on the issue without providing details or a timeline for a potential deal. The crown prince, however, did reiterate that Riyadh wants to advance the establishment of a Palestinian state as part of a potential agreement.\n\n“We believe having a good relation with all Middle Eastern countries is a good thing, and we want to be part of the Abraham Accords,” Prince Mohammed told reporters.\n\n“But we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path [to a] two-state solution. And today we have a healthy discussion with Mr President that we’ve got to work on that, to be sure that we can prepare the right situation as soon as possible to have that.”\n\nSaudi officials have previously stressed that Riyadh is committed to the Arab Peace Initiative, which conditions the recognition of Israel on the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nTrump said he had “good talks” with Prince Mohammed about the issue.\n\n“We talked about one state, two states. We talked about a lot of things. In a short period of time, we’ll be discussing it further too,” the US president said.\n\nAt a black-tie dinner he hosted at the White House for the Saudi leader, Trump announced the US has decided to recognise Riyadh as a “major non-NATO ally”.\n\nThat status allows a country expedited access to US military hardware, sales and other cooperation without some of the elaborate licensing protocols that other buyers of advanced American weapons systems need to go through.\n\nSaudi Arabia joins 19 other countries that are major non-NATO allies of the US: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia. The US also treats Taiwan at par with major non-NATO allies.\n\nSeparately, the White House announced that Trump and MBS signed a strategic defence agreement “that strengthens our more than 80-year defense partnership and fortifies deterrence across the Middle East”. Details of the agreement are unclear, but the White House said it would secure “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs” and would affirm that the “Kingdom views the United States as its primary strategic partner”.\n\nThe agreement comes weeks after Saudi Arabia signed a mutual defence agreement with Pakistan following Israel’s September attack on Qatar, which had sparked concerns across the region over whether the US could be trusted by its Gulf allies as a security partner.\n\nOn Monday, Trump confirmed that he will authorise the sale of  F-35 fighter jets  to Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring the meeting with MBS, he said the jets would not be downgraded to ensure Israel’s military superiority in the region, a departure from a US policy known as “qualitative military edge”.\n\n“They’d like you to get planes of reduced calibre. I don’t think that makes you too happy,” he told the Saudi crown prince.\n\n“They’ve been a great ally. Israel has been a great ally, and we’re looking at that exactly right now. But as far as I’m concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line.”\n\nTrump once again  expressed pride  in the US strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities in June.\n\n“We did that on behalf of everybody, and the outcome was extraordinary because we have the best pilots, the best equipment, the best planes, the best everything,” he said.\n\nThe US president later shifted to a softer tone on Iran, saying Tehran is seeking a diplomatic resolution with Washington, which has sought the dismantlement of its nuclear programme.\n\n“I am totally open to it, and we’re talking to them,” Trump said.\n\n“And we start a process. But it would be a nice thing to have a deal with Iran. And we could have done it before the war, but that didn’t work out. And something will happen there, I think.”\n\nSaudi Arabia’s official news agency, SPA, had reported that MBS had received a handwritten letter addressed to him from Iranian President  Masoud Pezeshkian  before his trip to Washington. No details were available about its content.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prince Mohammed said Saudi Arabia would back a US-Iran deal.\n\n“We will do our best to help to reach a deal between the United States of America and Iran,” he told reporters.\n\n“And we believe it’s good for Iran’s future to have a good deal that would satisfy the region and the world and the United States of America.”\n\nAt the outset of the two leaders’ public remarks, Trump expressed gratitude for anticipated Saudi investments in the US, which he said will be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n“I want to thank you because you’ve agreed to invest $600bn into the United States. And because he’s my friend, he might make it $1 trillion, but I’m going to have to work on him,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that the Saudi funds will create jobs and resources for US companies and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nFor his part, MBS said the Saudi investments in the US will likely rise to $1 trillion.\n\n“The agreement that we are signing today in many areas – in technology and AI, in rare materials, magnet, etc – that will create a lot of investment opportunities,” he said.\n\nThe crown prince echoed Trump’s assessment that the US is now the “hottest country” in the world, adding that the kingdom wants to be part of the “foundation of emerging technologies” in the US.\n\nTrump and MBS were all smiles as they exchanged flattering comments from the moment the crown prince arrived at the White House.\n\nAt one point, Trump reached for Prince Mohammed’s hand and held it as he criticised former US President Joe Biden for giving MBS only  a fist bump  when he visited Riyadh during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.\n\n“I grabbed that hand. I don’t give a hell where that hand’s been,” Trump said.\n\nThe US president described the Saudi crown prince as “fantastic” and “brilliant”.\n\n“We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today, and a friend of mine for a long time – very good friend of mine,” Trump said.\n\n“I’m very proud of the job he’s done. What he’s done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.”\n\nThe US president went on to rebuke an ABC News reporter for asking a challenging question of Prince Mohammed, accusing her of disrespecting his guest.\n\nWhen the same journalist later asked Trump why he would not voluntarily release government files related to sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein , Trump said ABC News’s broadcasting licence should be revoked.\n\n“You’re a terrible person and a terrible reporter.”\n\nAbout the same time as Trump welcomed MBS, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to compel the release of the Epstein files."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/19/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1364","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"01:51:59+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,364","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 364th day of active combat, marking a significant milestone in the prolonged conflict that began in February 2022.

Similar benefits were observed in metastatic melanoma, with vaccinated patients surviving beyond three years. The mechanism appears to involve mRNA vaccines 'waking up' the immune system, making dendritic cells more alert and enabling T cells to detect and attack cancer cells. These findings, published in Nature and presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, suggest that mRNA vaccines could be repurposed as a universal tool to enhance cancer immunotherapy, potentially revolutionizing oncology.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/nigeria-intensifies-search-for-25-abducted-schoolgirls","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:10:57+00:00","title":"Nigeria intensifies search for 25 abducted schoolgirls","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northwest Nigeria, security forces are intensifying efforts to locate 25 schoolgirls abducted in a coordinated raid on the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, on the morning of Monday, April 1, 2025.

UK over attack on Israeli arms maker\n\nSix British members of the proscribed Palestine Action group have been  put on trial by UK authorities , who said the group intended to damage property belonging to Israeli weaponsmaker Elbit Systems.\n\nProsecutors said at the trial on Tuesday that the defendants meticulously planned the assault on the arms manufacturer’s facility in southwestern England’s Bristol in early August 2024, allegedly resulting in property damage and injury to a police officer.\n\nThe six men and women were part of a team who attempted to “cause as much damage as possible and obtain information about the company”, prosecutor Deanna Heer told the court at Woolwich. They deny charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder.\n\nOne of the defendants is also charged with causing a police officer bodily harm after hitting her with a sledgehammer while she tried to arrest another defendant.\n\nHeer said the six individuals used fire extinguishers filled with red paint to spray the walls in an act of protest. They also smashed computers and technical products at the Elbit facility, according to the prosecutor.\n\nThe court saw footage recorded by police body-cameras as well as GoPro cameras worn by the defendants, which showed the defendants smashing property at the facility that makes weapons, including drones.\n\nThe British government designated Palestine Action, formed in 2020 by activists to “disrupt the arms industry in the UK”, as a “terrorist” group in July, almost a year after the incident at the Bristol facility.\n\nThe detainees are part of a group of 24 activists linked to the group who have been arrested at different times, and have been in custody for more than a year without trial, breaking the UK’s six-month pre-trial detention limit.\n\nTheir prosecution has drawn international scrutiny, showcasing an aspect of how the administration of Prime Minister Keir Starmer is dealing with pro-Palestinian sentiment.\n\nThousands of people have demonstrated in support of the activist group and the detainees, while UK police have arrested hundreds in recent weeks.\n\nMore than 500 people were detained during Palestine Action protests in London on October 4 alone, as British authorities implement what they call “anti-terror” laws.\n\nDuring the court hearing on Tuesday, Judge Jeremy Johnson told the jury that while they were entitled to their personal feelings about  Israel’s two-year war on Gaza , they were irrelevant to the case.\n\nHe said the question over whether the government’s move to proscribe Palestine Action was legal also had no bearing on the case, and urged the jury to “judge the case on the evidence”.\n\nThe trial is expected to last 10 weeks.

United States, where he has met President Donald Trump at the White House.\n\nThe trip  – the crown prince’s first since 2018 – is a sign of the strong relationship between Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration.\n\nEvidence of that is the  planned sale  of up to 48 F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, something the kingdom has been pursuing for years, but which previous US administrations have refused to do – partially because of opposition from Israel.\n\nSo why is Saudi Arabia eager to buy the F-35? And why has the US changed its position on the sale? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nThe F-35 refers to a family of stealth strike fighters manufactured by the US aerospace company Lockheed Martin. Its official website bills the F35 Lightning II – to give the plane its full name – as “The Most Advanced Fighter Jet in the World”.\n\nAs a stealth fighter, it is designed to avoid detection by radar and other technologies. It can then use its strike capabilities to attack an enemy’s defences and fighter jets before they have launched, thereby establishing air superiority in any given conflict if successful.\n\nSeveral countries are partners with the US when it comes to manufacturing F-35s, including Australia, Canada, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. They either manufacture certain components of the fighter jets or have facilities where they assemble the jets that their own governments will use.\n\nThe F-35A is the most common variant, owned by the largest number of countries. It can take off and land on a regular runway. The F-35A’s weapons and fuel are internal, within the jet’s body, to keep its stealth capabilities.\n\nThe F-35I “Adir” is a customised F-35A owned by Israel. It includes Israeli-developed technologies to enhance its stealth capabilities, including jamming and decoy systems. It has also been modified with external fuel tanks to enable it to fly longer missions without the need to refuel. Israel has secured US permission to modify the jet’s main operating system to allow the installation of local Israeli weapons.\n\nThe F35-B is used by Italy, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US. It is capable of landing like a helicopter and taking off with very short lead-up, making it a good option for operating out of very short airstrips. Even though it is slightly smaller than the F35-A, it is heavier and has reduced fuel and weapons capacity.\n\nThe F35-C is a supersonic, US Navy aircraft used for long-range stealth operations. It is tailored for use on aircraft carriers.\n\nF-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin describes the fighter jet as the “most lethal, survivable and connected fighter aircraft in the world”.\n\nMuch of the plane’s reputation for air superiority comes from its combination of stealth, advanced sensors and high-speed computing in a single platform.\n\nIt is engineered to reduce detection and gather more information on its surroundings than earlier generations of fighter jets, feeding data from a 360-degree camera suite and other sensors directly to the pilot.\n\nFor militaries investing in the jet, it represents a significant change in how air power is used – placing less emphasis on speed and more on identifying threats first, sharing that information across the force, and coordinating strikes with other assets.\n\nSaudi Arabia is already a leading buyer of US weapons, and has been for decades. But it has not been able to get into the F-35 programme.\n\nChanging that would allow Saudi Arabia to upgrade its air force and strengthen its position in the Middle East. While relations are currently positive with Iran, Riyadh and Tehran have  previously cut off ties  and have regarded each other as threats.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also previously fought the Houthi rebels in Yemen. That conflict that has  not yet been resolved , and while currently cold, could turn hot again in the next few years.\n\nThe US Congress does have the power to reject weapons sales even if they are authorised by the president, and may choose to do so.\n\nBut Trump has made his position clear, and reiterated in his appearance with Prince Mohammed in front of the press at the White House on Tuesday that he wanted to go ahead with the sale.\n\nHe batted off criticism of Saudi Arabia and the crown prince, particularly over the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which had been a major source of tension between the two countries for years, particularly under the administration of former US President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd he also notably showed no deference to the “qualitative military edge” US security policy, which holds that Israel should always have more superior weaponry than its Middle Eastern neighbours.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would have the same F-35s that Israel does, going against decades of policy – even as Riyadh continues to refuse to sign on to the Abraham Accords and officially establish ties with Israel."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/us-court-blocks-new-texas-congressional-map-while-state-officials-appeal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"21:09:20+00:00","title":"US court blocks new Texas congressional map while state officials appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal court in Texas has blocked the state’s newly redrawn congressional map, ruling that it racially gerrymandered districts and violated the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution.

To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics,” the court’s majority wrote in the opening of its 160-page opinion.\n\nThe ruling marked a major setback to efforts to redraw congressional districts ahead of the critically important midterms, which decide the composition of the US Congress.\n\nAll 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs in that election. With Republicans holding a narrow 219-seat majority, analysts speculate that control of the chamber could potentially switch parties.\n\nTexas, a Republican stronghold, had kicked off  a nationwide race to redesign congressional districts  in favour of one party or the other.\n\nIn June, news reports emerged that the administration of President Donald Trump had reached out to state officials to redraw the red state’s map, in order to gain five additional House seats for Republicans.\n\nDespite hesitations and a walkout by state Democrats, the Texas legislature  passed a new, gerrymandered map  in August.\n\nThat inspired other right-leaning states, notably North Carolina and Missouri, to similarly redraw their districts. North Carolina and Missouri each passed a map that would gain Republicans one additional House seat.\n\nTexas’s actions also sparked a Democratic backlash. California Governor Gavin Newsom  spearheaded a ballot campaign  in his heavily blue state to pass a proposition in November that would suspend an independent districting commission and instead pass a partisan map, skewed in favour of Democrats.\n\nVoters  passed the ballot initiative  overwhelmingly in November, teeing up Democrats to gain five extra seats in California next year.\n\nThe state redistricting battle has sparked myriad legal challenges, including the one decided in Texas on Tuesday.\n\nIn that case, civil rights groups accused the Texas government of attempting to dilute the power of Black and Hispanic voters.\n\nJudges David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Jeffrey V Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote the majority decision in favour of the plaintiffs.\n\nA third judge — Jerry Smith, appointed under Ronald Reagan — dissented from their decision.\n\nWriting for the majority, Brown said that Trump official Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division,  made the “legally incorrect assertion” that four congressional districts in the state were “unconstitutional” because they had non-white majorities.\n\nThe letter Dhillon sent containing that assertion helped prompt the Texas redistricting fight, Brown argued.\n\nThe judge also pointed to statements Texas Governor Greg Abbott made, seeming to reference the racial composition of the districts. If the new map’s aims were purely partisan and not racial, Brown indicated that it was curious no majority-white districts were targeted.\n\nTuesday’s ruling restores the 2021 map of Texas congressional districts. Currently, the state is represented by 25 Republicans and 12 Democrats in the US House.\n\nAlready, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has pledged to appeal the ruling before the US Supreme Court.\n\n“The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” Paxton  wrote  in a statement posted to social media.\n\nHe expressed optimism about his odds before the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. “I fully expect the Court to uphold Texas’s sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”\n\nCalifornia’s new congressional map likewise faces a legal challenge, with  the Trump administration suing  alongside state Republicans."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A landslide in Cilacap district, Central Java province, Indonesia, on Thursday evening resulted in at least two deaths and 21 missing people, following several days of heavy rainfall.

wire led cargo ship to crash into Baltimore bridge: Report\n\nA single loose wire on the Dali, a 300-metre (984ft) container ship, was responsible for the deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore last year, according to a months-long investigation by the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\n\nDue to problems with the wiring, the Dali experienced two blackouts on March 26, 2024, before losing control of propulsion and steering, leading the container ship to crash into the bridge and kill six highway workers, the NTSB said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe bridge collapse created a global media sensation last year when a livestream video of the accident went viral. It was captured by a camera set up to monitor traffic through the Port of Baltimore but instead filmed the swift collapse of a major section of the bridge.\n\nNTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said finding the culprit behind the accident took months of diligent work from the agency’s investigators.\n\n“Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,” she said. “The Dali at almost 1,000ft is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower.”\n\nThe investigation also found that the crew of the Dali tried and failed to steer the ship away from the bridge but was unable to do so due to electrical problems, the NTSB said.\n\nThe agency praised the ship’s pilots for swiftly notifying local authorities of the problems, which led the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop traffic from crossing the nearly 4km-long (2.5-mile-long) bridge.\n\nSeven workers were already on the bridge at the time, the NTSB said, and six were killed in the accident.\n\nThe shipping channel fully reopened in June, but the Maryland Transportation Board said this week that the bridge will not reopen until 2030 and will cost $4.3bn to $5.2bn to repair, according to CBS News."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/whats-behind-a-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-japan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"14:32:02+00:00","title":"What’s behind a surge in bear attacks in Japan?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan is facing a surge in bear attacks, with at least 13 deaths and over 100 injuries since April 2025—the highest toll since 2006.

in bear attacks in Japan?\n\nA deadly conflict between bears and humans is playing out across Japan, where authorities have deployed the military to protect locals who are using drone-based alert and surveillance systems to track the bears.\n\nSince April this year, at least 13 people have been  killed  and more than 100 have been injured in bear attacks in the country, according to an October report by the Ministry of Environment. The ministry added that the death toll is the highest since Japan began keeping records of bear attacks in 2006.\n\nJapan is home to big brown bears, which can weigh more than 450kg (1,000 pounds) and live in the country’s Hokkaido region, one of Japan’s northernmost islands known for its hot springs and volcanoes. It is also home to Asiatic black bears – also known as Moon bears – which are smaller in size, weighing between 80-200kg (176-440 pounds), and are found on the mainland, which is more densely populated.\n\nBoth types of bear have been involved in incidents this year, and both are dangerous to humans to varying degrees. Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1811-11-20","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article covers a range of global science and technology developments, including Warner Bros Discovery’s potential breakup due to declining television revenue, Amazon’s significant layoffs, and political claims by former President Trump regarding nuclear weapons and autism.

Scotland since France 1998.\n\nYet the Scottish side beat a 10-man Danish side 4-2 in a winner- takes-all match in Group C with Scott McTominay scoring with a bicycle kick just three minutes into the match, sending Scotland’s supporters at Hampden Park into raptures.\n\nThe early cheers of the Scottish fans were dampened when Denmark’s Rasmus Hojlund levelled the score.\n\nScotland’s Lawrence Shankland then put the home team ahead again, but that too was equalised by the Danes’ Patrick Dorgu in the 82nd minute.\n\nA draw in the game would have given Denmark the group win, and the Danes were in a good position to achieve that result before Kieran Tierney put the Scottish side ahead again three minutes into added time.\n\nKenny McLean then sealed Scotland’s World Cup qualification eight minutes into stoppage time when he chipped a shot over Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line.\n\n“You would not believe it,” one match commentator said when Scotland scored their fourth goal, sending fans into delirium and ensuring the game will become part of the fabled folklore of Scottish football.\n\n“We’ve been on a journey.

We’re going to the World Cup,” he said.\n\nDenmark, who only needed to avoid defeat to make sure of their third successive World Cup finals appearance, were left crestfallen.

So why are musicians alarmed?\n\nFor 44 years, Tim Baker has been crafting bows for stringed instruments like violins and cellos. He knows how crucial the thin, supple strip of wood can be for musicians.\n\n“Some people just use one bow their whole life,” said Baker said from his home in the United Kingdom.\n\n“The bow is really their voice. The violin, you just have a string, and you put your fingers down. But the way the sound comes out all comes from the bow.”\n\nBut now his trade faces a threat from an unlikely source: conservationists and the Brazilian government.\n\nThe majority of high-end bows are made from brazilwood, also known as pernambuco.\n\nPrized for its reddish hue and durability, brazilwood is beloved among musicians. Famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma described it as “without equal” when it comes to bows.\n\nHowever, a proposal to bolster restrictions could mean musicians would need to register their instruments in order to travel abroad or sell them.\n\nThat prospect has been described by some music advocates as their “worst nightmare”.\n\n“Every musician's choice for a bow is a highly personal one based on a lot of factors: the feel, the weight. And even depending on which repertoire they're playing, it might call for a different bow to create a different sound,” said Heather Noonan, vice president for advocacy at the League of American Orchestras.\n\n“One [potential consequence] is that musicians would not be able to use their best instruments professionally.”\n\nThe issue is set to come to a head next week, as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) holds its 20th meeting.\n\nHeightened restrictions on brazilwood are scheduled to be raised for a vote at the conference.\n\nSince 1998, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified the tree as endangered.\n\nBut a  proposal  authored by the Brazilian government would increase CITES protections for brazilwood, placing it in the highest tier for trade restrictions.\n\nCITES regulates the international trade of endangered species, and it classifies animals and plants in three appendices.\n\nThe third is the least restrictive: If a species is endangered in a given country, then export permits are required from that country.\n\nThe Appendix II has tighter standards: Export permits are required from wherever the species is extracted. Most endangered species, including brazilwood, fall into this category.\n\nBut Brazil hopes to bump brazilwood up to appendix one, a category for species faced with extinction.\n\nTrade of plants and animals in that appendix is largely banned, except for non-commercial use. But even in that case, both import and export licences are required.\n\nIn its proposal, Brazil argues the upgraded restrictions are necessary to fight the plant's extinction.\n\nOnly about 10,000 adult brazilwood trees remain. The population has shrunk by 84 percent over the last three generations, and  illegal logging  has played a dominant role in that  decline , according to the proposal.\n\n\"Selective extraction of Brazilwood is still active, both inside and outside protected areas,\" the proposal explains.\n\n\"In all cases recently detected, the destination of these woods is the bow-making industry for musical instruments.\"\n\nIt adds that “520 years of intense exploitation” have led to the “complete elimination of the species in several regions”.\n\nOne operation launched by Brazilian police in October 2018 resulted in 45 companies and bowmakers being fined.\n\nNearly 292,000 bows and blanks — the unfinished blocks of wood destined to become bows — were seized.\n\nAnother investigation, between 2021 and 2022, led police to conclude that an estimated $46m in profits had come from the illegal brazilwood trade.\n\n“The majority of bows and bow blanks sold by Brazilian companies over the past 25 years probably originated from illegal sources,\" Brazil wrote in its proposal.\n\nConservation groups like the NGO TRAFFIC have backed the increased protections for brazilwood, arguing that drastic action is necessary for the tree's survival.\n\nTRAFFIC's policy director Sarah Ferguson said that 144 trees are needed to make just 700 bows.\n\nIn the past 25 years, she added, Brazilian craftsmen have exported 130,000 bows, indicating a huge demand for the tree.\n\n“There's low population numbers. They're not found in that many areas. And they're found at huge volumes in trade,” Ferguson said.\n\nCurrently, under Appendix II, there is an exemption for finished brazilwood products that allows musicians to travel freely with their bows.\n\nIt also ensures that Brazil’s large bow-making industry is able to sell its products abroad.\n\nBut the possibility of promoting brazilwood to Appendix I has sparked alarm among musicians.\n\nOne petition on the website Change.org, calling for the rejection of Brazil's proposal, has garnered more than 10,000 signatures in support.\n\nNoonan, from the League of American Orchestras, worries that the special permitting process for an Appendix I product would be a logistical quagmire for travelling orchestras.\n\nIt could even result in instruments being confiscated, she added.\n\n“The risks of getting some part of this process wrong as you endeavour to comply with it can be quite severe, especially for individual musicians who may not have a lot of infrastructure to help them get through the process,” Noonan said.\n\nIn October, a group of musicians published an open letter in the French newspaper Le Monde, warning of an “unmanageable explosion” of permit applications.\n\nNoonan argued that musical instruments are unlike other animal or plant products managed by CITES.\n\nThey often remain in use for centuries. And while an exotic pet may be traded internationally once, she pointed out that a musician may pass multiple borders on a single tour.\n\nIf Brazil's proposal is accepted, a musician would need to have their permit certified at each border by a CITES-approved official, she said.

No one saved him. I will not rest until those who burned him can never harm another mother’s child again.”\n\nBut as hundreds of families who lost their loved ones during last year’s uprising come to terms with Monday’s landmark sentencing, many wonder if Hasina will actually face justice.\n\nThere are questions around whether India, a close ally of Hasina during her 15 years of rule, would  extradite her and Khan , or whether it might instead help them escape justice.\n\n“They took five minutes to burn my son alive, but it took almost a year and a half to deliver this verdict,” said Begum from her ancestral home in Shyampur village in the northern Gaibandha district.\n\n“Can this government really bring her back from India? What happens if the government changes and the next one protects Hasina and her collaborators? Who will guarantee that these killers won’t escape?”\n\nAs hundreds gathered outside the tribunal building in Dhaka on Monday, Mir Mahbubur Rahman Snigdho – whose brother Mir Mugdho was shot dead during the uprising – said Hasina “deserves the maximum penalty many times over,” urging the authorities to bring her back to Bangladesh to enforce the judgement.\n\nStanding close to him was Syed Gazi Rahman, father of killed protester Mutasir Rahman. He called for the sentence to be carried out “swiftly and publicly,” accusing Hasina of “emptying the hearts of thousands of families”.\n\nSome 300km (186 miles) away, at Bhabnapur Jaforpara village in the northern district of Rangpur, family members of Abu Sayeed also welcomed the death sentence against the former prime minister.\n\nSayeed was the first casualty of the July Uprising, which started with mainly student-led protests against a  controversial quota system  for government jobs that disproportionately favoured the children of people who fought in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan.\n\nOn July 16, 2024, Sayeed, a student leader, was shot dead by the police while demonstrating in Rangpur.\n\n“My heart has finally cooled down. I am satisfied. She must be brought back from India and executed in Bangladesh without delay,” said his father, Mokbul Hossain.\n\n“My son is gone. It pains me. The sentence must be carried out,” added his mother, Monowara Begum. She said the family distributed sweets to those visiting them after the verdict.\n\nSanjida Khan Dipti, mother of Shahriar Khan Anas, a 10th-grade student who was shot dead in Dhaka’s Chankharpul neighbourhood on August 5, 2024, told Al Jazeera the verdict is “only a consolation”.\n\n“Justice will be served the day it is executed,” she said.\n\n“As a mother, even 1,400 death sentences would be insufficient for someone who emptied the hearts of thousands of mothers. The world must see the consequences when a ruler unleashes mass killing to cling to power. God may grant you time, but He does not spare.”\n\nDipti said she was not satisfied with the verdict against former police chief al-Mamun.\n\n“Abdullah al-Mamun should have received a longer sentence because, as part of the nation’s security force, he became a killer of our children,” she said.\n\nSeveral processions were taken out in Dhaka and other parts of the country on Monday after Hasina was sentenced to death.\n\nDuring a march inside the campus of the Dhaka University, Ar Rafi, a second-year undergraduate student, said they will rally to demand Hasina’s extradition from India.\n\n“We are happy for now. But we want Hasina brought back from India and executed. We, the students, will remain on the streets until her sentence is carried out,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, a group called Maulik Bangla staged a symbolic enactment of Hasina’s execution at Dhaka’s Shahbagh intersection area after the tribunal’s verdict.\n\n“This is a message that no dictator should rise again,” said Sharif Osman bin Hadi, spokesperson for Inquilab Manch (Revolution Front), a non-partisan cultural organisation inspired by the July Uprising.\n\nPolitical parties, including the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party, also welcomed the verdict.\n\n“This judgement proves that no matter how powerful a fascist or autocrat becomes, they will one day have to stand in the dock,” BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed told reporters on Monday.\n\nJamaat leader Mia Golam Porwar said the ruling proves that “no head of government or powerful political leader is above the law”, and that the verdict offers “some measure of comfort” to families of those killed during the uprising.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said while it considered the verdict was “an important moment for the victims”, it stressed that a trial held in absentia and resulting in a death sentence may not have followed due process and fair trial standards, as it reiterated its opposition to capital punishment.\n\nRights group Amnesty International also raised concerns about the fairness of the trial, saying the victims “deserve far better” and warning that rushed proceedings in absentia risk undermining justice.\n\n“Victims need justice and accountability, yet the death penalty simply compounds human rights violations. It’s the ultimate cruel, degrading and inhuman punishment and has no place in any justice process,” it said.\n\nBut the families of the victims say the verdict was a recognition of the brutality of the crackdown, and raises hopes for a closure.\n\n“This verdict sends a message: justice is inevitable,” said Atikul Gazi, a 21-year-old TikToker from Dhaka’s Uttara area who survived being shot at point-blank range on August 5, 2024, but ended up losing his left arm.\n\nA selfie video of him smiling – despite missing an arm –  went viral last year , making him a symbol of resilience. “It feels like the souls of the July martyrs will now find some peace,” Gazi told Al Jazeera."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, co-discoverer of the DNA double helix structure and recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine, has died at the age of 97.

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/solar-storms-hit-earth-what-are-they-where-can-northern-lights-be-seen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:01:31+00:00","title":"Solar storms to hit Earth, triggering northern lights: What we know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of powerful solar storms, primarily driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, are currently affecting Earth and causing intense auroral displays across the northern hemisphere, including the US, Canada, and parts of Europe.

triggering northern lights: What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds. Amazing display of Northern Lights captured in Carlow.  pic.twitter.com/ws2JQWUcs3\n\n— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather)  November 12, 2025\n\nOther sightings are expected or have been reported in\n\nNot directly to humans, because Earth’s atmosphere protects us from radiation.\n\nHowever, the bursts of energy could temporarily disrupt communication systems, potentially affecting GPS navigation, radio communications, and satellites, including air traffic control radio and satellites in space. The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, effective December 10, 2025, restricting access to platforms including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s announcement of resuming US nuclear weapon testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright to involve only noncritical, non-explosive component tests.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0vekq12ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:50:22.166+00:00","title":"Brazil creates new Indigenous territories during protest-hit COP30","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil has announced the creation of 10 new Indigenous territories during the COP30 climate summit, a significant step in protecting the Amazon rainforest and preserving biodiversity.

by protests in recent days.\n\nThe designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.\n\nThe move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year.\n\n\"Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,\" Dinamam Tuxu from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30.\n\nThe latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree.\n\nMr Tuxu said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders.\n\n\"Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,\" he said.\n\n\"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,\" he added.\n\nSome indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture.\n\nOn Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International.\n\nVicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International.\n\nThousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".\n\nAnd last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security.\n\nSecurity around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.\n\nBut this remains the COP with the highest number of representatives from indigenous groups.\n\n\"This makes me very happy. We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities,\" Kleber Karipuna, from APIB, told BBC News.\n\nMore than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\".\n\nPast recognition of Indigenous reserves  banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming , in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation.\n\nExpanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.\n\nThe new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.\n\nOne area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.\n\nThe Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.\n\nUntil the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.\n\nUnder his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.\n\nLula's government  has previously taken action  to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.\n\nCurrently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory.\n\nHundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is already at risk  of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.\n\nCarbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.\n\nCountries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C.\n\nThe UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629pny4gl7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:48:55.246+00:00","title":"Cloudflare apologises for outage which took down X and ChatGPT","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cloudflare, a global provider of internet infrastructure and security services used by over 20% of websites, experienced a major outage on 11:30 GMT, which caused widespread failures across high-profile platforms including X (formerly Twitter), ChatGPT, Zoom, Grindr, and Canva.

high-profile websites, including X and ChatGPT, went down for many on Tuesday, due to problems affecting major internet infrastructure firm, Cloudflare.\n\nThousands of users began reporting issues with the sites, as well as other services, to outage monitoring site Downdetector shortly after 11:30 GMT.\n\nCloudflare said the \"significant outage\" occurred after a configuration file designed to handle threat traffic did not work as intended and \"triggered a crash\" in its software handling traffic for its wider services.\n\n\"We apologise to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable,\" the company added.\n\nIt said while the issue had been resolved, some services might still encounter errors as they came back online.\n\nA wide range of apps and websites were impacted by the outage.\n\nUsers reported encountering delays or technical issues when trying to access services such as Grindr, Zoom and Canva.\n\nMeanwhile social media platform X (formerly Twitter) was displaying a message on its homepage for some users which said there was a problem with its internal server due to an \"error\" originating with Cloudflare.\n\nChatGPT's site was also displaying an error message telling some users: \"please unblock challenges cloudflare.com to proceed.\"\n\nCloudflare is a huge provider of internet security across the world, carrying out services such as checking visitor connections to sites are coming from humans rather than bots.\n\nIt says 20% of all websites worldwide use its services in some form.\n\nThe range of sites affected was demonstrated by the fact Downdetector itself - a site many flock to when sites stop loading or appear to have issues - also displayed an error message as many tried to access it on Tuesday.\n\nAlp Toker, director of NetBlocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said the outage \"points to a catastrophic disruption to Cloudflare's infrastructure\".\n\n\"What's striking is how much of the internet has had to hide behind Cloudflare infrastructure to avoid denial of service attacks in recent years,\" he told the BBC - highlighting how the company aims to protect sites against malicious attempts to overwhelm them with traffic requests.\n\nHe said that however, as a result of this - and the convenience of its services - it had also become \"one of the internet's largest single points of failure.\"\n\nCloudflare has stressed the problem was the result of a technical problem.\n\n\"To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity,\" it said in its statement.\n\nThe company's share price was trading around 3% lower shortly after 15:00 GMT.\n\nIssues affecting Cloudflare's services come after an outage impacting Amazon Web Services last month saw  more than 1,000 sites and apps knocked offline .\n\nAnother major web services provider, Microsoft Azure,  was also affected shortly  afterwards.\n\n\"The outages we have witnessed these last few months have once again highlighted the reliance on these fragile networks,\" said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET.\n\n\"Companies are often forced to heavily rely on the likes of Cloudflare, Microsoft, and Amazon for hosting their websites and services, as there aren't many other options.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Trump's tariff rollback lower food prices?\n\nWhen President Donald Trump last week removed tariffs on more than 200 products, it represented something of a political earthquake, and marked a significant concession on a hallmark White House policy\n\nThe decision, which critics said was long overdue, came as the president returned his attention to cost-of-living issues, after polls suggested affordability concerns were weighing down White House approval ratings and hurting Republican candidates in recent elections.\n\nA top lobby group for the food industry, FMI, the Food Industry Association, hailed the tariff rollback, which affected popular items like bananas and coffee, as a \"critical step\" toward affordability, as other business groups also praised the move.\n\nBut in the end, the practical relief may not feel as monumental as the political gesture.\n\nIn October, the Budget Lab at Yale projected that Trump's tariffs this year - currently a baseline tax of 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would drive up food prices 1.9% in the short run.\n\nThe impact would be significant, given that US grocery prices historically have been relatively stable, rising an average of only 2% a year between 2013 and 2021.\n\nThe White House order did not eliminate tariffs on all food, but it removed levies on some items, such as coffee, spices and tropical fruit like bananas, for which US production is negligible or non-existent.\n\nFor those kinds of goods, economists and businesses said they expected the order would help bring down prices - and relatively quickly.\n\nAnthony Serafino, president of the New Jersey-based fruit importer and distributor EXP Group, said he expected to drop his prices in the coming weeks, after raising them earlier this year to cover millions of dollars in new tariff costs.\n\nHe said it might take a few weeks for shoppers to see the difference, since he has to sell items he brought in before the change. But he expected the decision to be a \"big help\".\n\n\"We were just passing through costs. We're not going to keep prices elevated just to keep prices elevated,\" he said.\n\nThe overall impact on household grocery budgets, however, may still end up feeling relatively modest.\n\nThough the US is heavily dependent on foreign supplies in certain categories, such as fresh fruit and seafood, imports typically account for less than 20% of overall food and beverage purchases by Americans, according to USDA.\n\nAnd many food imports from Mexico - America's single biggest foreign food supplier - were already spared tariffs, due to White House exemptions for goods covered by a US, Mexico and Canada free trade agreement.\n\n\"You will certainly see it on certain products,\" said Sean Cash, a professor of food economics at Tufts University.  \"I don't think we're going to see a lot in terms of the average price of groceries coming down.\"\n\nFood companies are still facing higher costs from tariffs on materials like aluminium, used to make canned foods; items like wine, cheese and palm oil did not make the list.\n\nRecent jumps in food prices also reflect factors unrelated to tariffs, like rising labour costs and droughts, which hit coffee and cattle supplies.\n\n\"If we got rid of trade barriers on food items and food commodities, would that make food cheaper in the US? Yes, a little bit, but not that much, because most of what we're buying are services,\" said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, noting costs like border inspections, washing, trucking fees and supermarket workers.\n\nOverall, grocery prices climbed 2.7% over the 12 months to September.\n\nThat is still significantly lower than the huge jumps in 2022 and 2023, when grocery prices surged 11.4% and 5% respectively.\n\nTrump administration officials have cast high food prices as a mess they inherited from the Biden administration, and warned it will take time to correct the problem.\n\nIn a briefing for reporters last week about new tariff exemptions, they acknowledged the effects might be limited, saying reducing prices in grocery aisles was the goal and not a guarantee.\n\nWalmart, Target and Kroger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFood prices tend to fluctuate more than other kinds of goods, meaning some relief is likely, especially given attention on the issue, economists said.\n\nBut Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Canada, warned today's high prices are likely to inform future decisions, comparing the dynamic to the \"tide\".\n\n\"The tide goes up, it leaves a mark on the dock and that line remains,\" he said. \"If tariffs disappear, you will see that mental mark remaining and industry tends to work with that mark.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"01:16:47.254+00:00","title":"Roblox blocks children from chatting to adult strangers","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roblox, one of the world’s most popular gaming platforms with over 80 million daily users—including 40% under age 13—is introducing mandatory age verification using facial estimation technology to prevent children from chatting with adult strangers.

safety measures.\n\nMandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.\n\nRoblox has faced criticism for allowing youngsters to access inappropriate content and communicate with adults, and is being sued over child safety concerns in several US states.\n\nThe launch also comes just ahead of  Australia's social media ban for under-16s  - the government is under pressure to include gaming platforms such as Roblox.\n\nIn March, the chief executive of Roblox Dave Baszucki  told the BBC  that parents who were worried about the service \"should not let their children be on [it]\".\n\nHowever, some parents and campaigners warned children could still encounter inappropriate content or talk to adults on the platform despite existing safety measures.\n\nRani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, said young people were exposed to \"unacceptable risks\" on Roblox, \"leaving many vulnerable to harm and online abuse.\"\n\nThe charity welcomed the platform's efforts but called on Roblox to \"ensure they deliver change for children in practice and prevent adult perpetrators from targeting and manipulating young users.\"\n\nThe platform averaged more than 80 million daily players in 2024, about 40% of them under the age of 13.\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.\n\nThe communications regulator, Ofcom, is responsible for

ensuring they meet their responsibilities. There's more to do, but change is happening.\"\n\nIn the US, Roblox is facing lawsuits in Texas, Kentucky and Louisiana over child safety concerns.\n\nRoblox says it will become the first large gaming platform to make facial age verification a requirement for accessing the chat features.\n\nMatt Kaufman, chief safety officer for Roblox, told a press briefing the age estimation technology is \"pretty accurate.\"\n\nHe claimed the system can make close estimates of \"within one to two years\" bracket for users aged between five and 25.\n\nCurrently it can be used voluntarily by anyone in the world.\n\nUsers who complete the process will be placed into age groups: under nine, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20 and 21+.\n\nPlayers can only chat with others in similar age ranges, unless they add someone as a \"trusted connection\", which is a feature for people they know.\n\nUnder-13s will still be blocked from private messages and certain chats unless a parent gives permission.\n\nThe new approach follows concerns about adults contacting younger players.\n\nIn a BBC test earlier this year, it was possible for a 27-year-old user and a 15-year-old user on unlinked devices to exchange messages.\n\nAt the time, Roblox said attempts to circumvent its rules often involved users trying to take conversations to different platforms.\n\nAge checks will use facial estimation technology through the device's camera inside the Roblox app, to estimate a user's age.\n\nImages are processed by an external provider and deleted immediately after the check has been completed, according to the company.\n\nRoblox says parents will still be able to manage their child's account, including updating a child's age once verification is complete.\n\nThe platform already prohibits image and video sharing in chats and heavily restricts links to external sites.\n\nThe company argues the new system will offer more \"age-appropriate\" experiences across the platform, and says it expects other firms to adopt similar methods.\n\nThe changes come as campaign groups ParentsTogether Action and UltraViolet stage a first-of-its-kind virtual protest inside Roblox.\n\nThe group will deliver a digital petition, which has been signed by more than 12,000 people, demanding the platform adopt stronger child-safety measures.\n\nIt calls for sweeping changes, declaring, \"Roblox must stop being a playground for predators.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjw52p58geo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"21:50:48.929+00:00","title":"Loose wire on ship may have led to Baltimore bridge collapse, report says","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A loose wire on the Dali container ship likely caused a power outage that may have contributed to the March 26, 2024, collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland.

led to Baltimore bridge collapse, report says\n\nA loose wire on a cargo ship caused a power outage that may have led to the 2024 deadly collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, US investigators have said.\n\nThe Dali container ship, which crashed into the bridge and left six workers dead, was \"preventable\", National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators said during a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nPolice stationed at the bridge's ends were notified that the ship had veered off course but did not call the construction team's inspector to warn them.\n\nHad the six workers been notified when police were, the NTSB said, they may have had time to evacuate.\n\n\"There would have been about one minute and 29 seconds to evacuate\" before the collision, said NTSB engineer Scott Parent, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThat could have been \"sufficient time to drive to a portion of the bridge that did not collapse\", he said.\n\nIn the black of night on 26 March 2024, several vehicles on the Scott Key bridge plunged into the icy waters of the River Patapsco in Baltimore, Maryland, after the Dali container ship crashed into one of its pillars. Six workers fell to their deaths.\n\nTuesday's hearing unveiled the potential causes behind the deadly tragedy, as outlined in the NTSB's year-long investigation.\n\nThe agency identified multiple factors, including the loss of electrical power from a faulty cable, problems with a fuel pump on the ship and a lack of counter measures to reduce the bridge's vulnerability. The NTSB also reviewed its safety recommendations.\n\nThe findings confirmed those of a 2024 NTSB preliminary report, which had cited faulty cables as the likely cause of an electrical blackout on the Dali in the final moments before collision.\n\n\"This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost. As with all accidents we investigate, this was preventable,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at the hearing.\n\nThe deadly incident was massively disruptive to the major US shipping Port of Baltimore while it was closed, and severed part of a major interstate roadway.\n\nOfficials preliminarily estimated the repairs would be completed by 2028 and cost roughly $1.9bn (£1.4bn). However, an update on Monday estimated the total cost of repairs to be closer to $5bn and moved the timeline for completion to 2030.\n\n\"Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,\" the state's Democratic Governor Wes Moore said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"Trade policies out of Washington, D.C. have raised prices on everything - including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\n\"Still, despite this new economic reality, our resolve is unwavering,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxr1r34ev9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"23:45:43.450+00:00","title":"Congress approves bill to release Epstein files that will head to Trump's desk","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress has passed a bipartisan bill requiring the U.S. Department of Justice to release all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, following pressure from survivors and public outcry.

The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity.\n\nLast week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nSome of those make mention of Trump, including one email, sent in 2011, in which Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.”\n\nThe White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n\nGiuffre, who died in April, has said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.\n\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\n\nThe push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation.\n\nMassie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm.\n\n“In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”.\n\nAnother Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\".\n\nAt a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she is speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors. She also called out Trump directly.\n\n\"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said.\n\nShe said that row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016.\n\nSurvivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same.\n\nEpstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”.\n\n“Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gdkwp2p9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"21:24:57.828+00:00","title":"'Things happen' - Trump defends Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a recent visit to the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with US President Donald Trump, who defended the crown prince by claiming he 'knew nothing' about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi—a claim that contradicts a 2021 US intelligence assessment stating the crown prince approved the operation.

happen' - Trump defends Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.\n\nTrump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.\n\nThe crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".\n\nIt was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing.\n\n\"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said.\n\n\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\"\n\n\"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"\n\nThe crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\".\n\nA US intelligence report made public in 2021  - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report.\n\nWhile dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.\n\nAt the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as \"negative, false and unacceptable\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's murder, for which she said there was \"no justification\".\n\n\"The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.\n\nTuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year.\n\nEchoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\".\n\nThe two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis.\n\nTrump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s.\n\nThe US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\n\n\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\n\n\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added.\n\nThe crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday.\n\nPortuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC.\n\nBiden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993e74pxd7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:57:34.472+00:00","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo to visit White House on same day as Saudi crown prince","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cristiano Ronaldo is set to visit the White House on the same day as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, marking a significant diplomatic and cultural event.

Kathryn Mayorga alleged that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, which he denied.\n\n\"I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\" he said in a statement in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven.\n\nIn early 2023, Ronaldo made the jump to Saudi Arabia when he became the face of the Saudi Pro League and captain of Al Nassr - the football club owned by sovereign wealth fund PIF which is chaired by the crown prince.\n\nIn an industry where players are paid extraordinary amounts of money, Ronaldo's pay deal with Saudi Arabia was astronomical. The footballer was reportedly paid $200m (£152m) a year - or more than half a million dollars a day.\n\nThen in June this year, he signed a new two-year deal for a reported total of $400m (£300m) and  became football's first billionaire player,  according to Bloomberg, with a net worth of $1.4bn.\n\nThat's a lot of money for a 40-year-old footballer in the twilight of his career.\n\nBut, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, Saudi Arabia has \"invested heavily in high profile events and individuals to put the kingdom on the map\" in terms of sports and tourism in its quest for modernism.\n\nRonaldo has referred to Prince Mohammed as \"our boss\" in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan.\n\nEarlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 FIFA World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for meeting Trump, Vakil says: \"The US president likes shiny things and Ronaldo is a shiny thing.\"\n\nThough the footballer has loftier ambitions for the meeting in Washington - world peace.\n\nIn July, European Council president Antonio Costa handed Trump a Portugal jersey signed by Ronaldo which read: \"To president Donald J.

was a principled \"NO\".\n\n\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"\n\nThe resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature.\n\nFor Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\n\n\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"\n\nHiggins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely.\n\n\"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.\n\nPrior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nBut it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.\n\nHiggins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.\n\nHis holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.\n\nIn 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\".\n\n\"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.\n\nFacebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.\n\nFacebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\".\n\nBefore Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office.

2025-11-17T23:01:18.831+00:00\n\nTitle: A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree\n\nSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.\n\nBut the rules weren't always so strict.\n\nIn 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\n\n\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"\n\nIn 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.\n\nUS concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.\n\nWright USA wasn't an isolated case.\n\nThe BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.\n\nBut on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"\n\nThe Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.\n\nStein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.\n\nFosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nHigh-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.\n\nVery few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\n\n\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"\n\nAidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.\n\nA four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the  first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.\n\nAidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.\n\n\"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds.\n\nThat size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\n\n\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"\n\nSome of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.\n\nIn it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year.\n\nBeijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.\n\nGlobal alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\n\n\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"\n\nAt a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.\n\nAidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how  the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company .\n\nThe United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.\n\nAidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\n\n\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"\n\nHowever, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\n\n\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\n\n\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"\n\nChina's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.\n\nIn the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.\n\nIt shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.\n\nNexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.\n\nThat bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.\n\nNexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions.\n\nThe company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.\n\nXiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\n\n\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"\n\nXiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\n\n\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says.\n\n\"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"\n\nIf China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\n\n\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\n\n\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot.\n\n\"They're going to move from defence to offence.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l73j781y9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"22:19:58.732+00:00","title":"Lebanon says Israeli strike killed 13 people near Palestinian refugee camp","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Israeli airstrike near the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon killed at least 13 people and injured four, with Israel claiming the strike targeted a Hamas training compound used for planning attacks.

newly redrawn voting maps\n\nA US federal court has blocked Texas from using new voting maps drawn by Republicans in an effort to shore up their majority in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe court said evidence indicated the new voting districts were \"racially gerrymandered\", and ordered the state to use the congressional lines they had in place before they redistricted earlier this year.\n\nRepublicans in the state legislature redrew voting districts mid-decade, sparking both Democrat and Republican-led states to follow suit and adjust their maps for a political edge ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to \"swiftly appeal to the US Supreme Court\" against Tuesday's ruling.\n\nGerrymandering - the redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour a political party - is practised by both main parties and is legal unless ruled to be racially motivated.\n\nCritics argue that the process allows politicians to pick their voters, rather than voters picking their elected officials.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling in Texas orders the state to set aside the newly approved maps, and instead use the ones created in 2021 by the Texas legislature.\n\n\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics,\" US Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote in the decision.\n\n\"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"\n\nThe leader of the Democrats in the statehouse, Gene Wu, praised the ruling, saying in a statement that \"a federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen\".\n\n\"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing,\" said Wu.\n\nGovernor Abbott said in a statement that the ruling was \"clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution\".\n\n\"The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason,\" said Abbott. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings.\"\n\nThe maps voted through in August by the Texas legislature, and approved by the state's Republican governor, create five new Republican-leaning districts.\n\nCalifornia voted to redraw its own maps earlier this month, leading to the creation of five Democrat-leaning seats.\n\nEarlier this month, a judge in Utah rejected an electoral map drawn by Republican lawmakers and ordered the adoption of a new map that would create one Democrat-leaning district in the state."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xzgw623go","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"23:00:46.207+00:00","title":"Pinkfong: How the viral Baby Shark video created a $400m business","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pinkfong, a South Korean children's media company founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, experienced explosive growth after releasing a 90-second Baby Shark video in June 2016.

June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.\n\nIt became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views -  YouTube's most watched video ever .\n\nThat song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.\n\nNot only has it  captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world,  it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\n\n\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”\n\nOn Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).\n\nFounded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age.\n\nIt had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\n\n\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.\n\nIt was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.\n\nPinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.\n\nThe firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.\n\nThe company has been known as Pinkfong since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.\n\nIt now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.\n\nBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.\n\nThe song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University.\n\nMr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\n\n\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.\n\nBut it was an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.\n\nVideos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.\n\nThere was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.\n\nIn November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.\n\nIt generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.\n\nBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of  plagiarising the work of an American composer .\n\nSouth Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.\n\nThe victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public.\n\nPinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.\n\nThe company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said.\n\nKim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.\n\nOne parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.\n\nFather of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\".\n\nStill, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.\n\nWhether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.\n\nIt raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.\n\nThe company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.\n\nPinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.\n\nBut now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Lee from the  Asia Specific podcast"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gdzrklr7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:50:45.888+00:00","title":"US House expected to approve resolution to release Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US House of Representatives is expected to approve a resolution to compel the Justice Department to release the 'Epstein files'—documents gathered during investigations into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.

justice department to release the \"Epstein files\": documents that were amassed during investigations into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said he expected a \"large vote tally\" when the measure came to the floor of the Republican-led chamber on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump called on Republican lawmakers to approve it.\n\nBut the files may not be released soon, and it is unclear if some will be held back. After the House, the measure must also be approved by the Senate.\n\nSurvivors of Epstein's abuse are also due to appear on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in support of the measure.\n\nOn Monday evening, the group World Without Exploitation projected images of some survivors onto buildings throughout Washington, all less than a mile from Capitol Hill, with the message: \"Congress, release all of the files.\"\n\nMembers of both parties who are calling for the release of the files believe that the information could implicate powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.\n\nAt various stages over the years, other Epstein-related materials have been put into the public domain. Last week, thousands of documents belonging to Epstein's estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.\n\nThese mention Trump and other high-profile individuals who were in Epstein's orbit, without implying any wrongdoing by those individuals.\n\nTrump has maintained he did not commit any wrongdoing and that he ended his friendship with Epstein long before Epstein was first arrested.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump supported the release of the files, but moved away from that position once in office, provoking frustration from his supporters. The justice department put out a limited batch of documents in February and later said there would be no more releases.\n\nLawmakers from both parties then began working on a resolution to force the release of all the files. Last week, at the end of the 43-day federal shutdown, Johnson swore in the newest House member, who immediately signed onto the petition to consider the resolution, pushing it over the threshold needed for a vote.\n\nTrump, who had put pressure on fellow Republicans to reject the resolution, performed a U-turn on Sunday by saying he would support it after all.\n\nSpeaking to reporters the following evening, he confirmed that he would also sign the resolution into law, assuming it met the approval of both chambers of Congress.\n\n\"Sure I would,\" he said. \"Let the Senate look at it, let anybody look at it. But don't talk about it too much.\" That was because, Trump said, the issue was taking attention away from his administration's accomplishments.\n\n\"We've done a great job and I hate to see that deflect from the great job we've done,\" he said.\n\nRepresentative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee that has been investigating the Epstein files, said Trump did not need to wait for the resolution to pass the House and then Senate.\n\n\"Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,\" he said in a statement on Monday in which he accused Trump of wanting \"to deflect and slow down our investigation.\"\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, a Republican who drew Trump's ire by pushing for the release, told CNN he was \"a little bit suspicious of this sudden turn of events\" but believed the total number of votes supporting the resolution on Tuesday would be \"very big\".\n\n\"We're worried that maybe they'll try to muck it up in the Senate,\" he added, referring to the possibility that the Republican-dominated upper chamber would change the resolution once that chamber took it up.\n\nSpeaker Johnson said on Monday he had issues with how the measure had been drafted and took \"some comfort\" that the Senate would \"be able to correct some of those concerns that we have, the protection of victims and whistle-blowers and all the rest\".\n\nChanging the measure could slow passage in the Senate. More time could then be required to reconcile the two chambers' different measures into one final version for Trump to sign.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi last week said the justice department was beginning federal investigations into former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and others who were mentioned in documents from the Epstein estate that the House Oversight Committee recently released.\n\nThe House resolution currently says Bondi can withhold documents that \"would jeopardise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p4gez742o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"01:01:36.793+00:00","title":"Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and power of Trump's base","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The release of government documents on Jeffrey Epstein, initially resisted by President Donald Trump, culminated in a 427-1 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives after mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers and public demand.

to force the justice department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the legislation will now move to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nAnd if Trump does sign it into law as expected, it will mark the final action in what has been a remarkable and abrupt change in his position.\n\nFor months, Trump was dismissive of calls to release the government's full trove of documents about the late financier and convicted sex offender. He described the case in July as \"pretty boring stuff\".\n\nThat was until Sunday, when - with a snowballing number of Republicans in the House signalling they would vote to release them - the president relented and encouraged them to do so. His shift opened the floodgates for an overwhelming 427-1 vote on Tuesday.\n\nHis reversal was a rare instance of Republican politicians pressuring Trump into action, and into a very public change in stance, rather than the other way around.\n\nRegardless of what new information any future files may contain, the saga exposed fractures within the Republican Party and highlighted the power of Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) base.\n\nIt also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote.\n\n\"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia.\n\n\"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added.\n\nA NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions.\n\n\"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC.\n\nHe praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\".\n\nFor much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House.\n\nThe most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\".\n\nDue to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back.\n\n\"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday.\n\nThe House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\".\n\nGreene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars.\n\nBut on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success.\n\n\"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\"\n\n\"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\"\n\nThe Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week,  President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on groceries  like coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased.\n\n\"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said.\n\nOne senior Trump administration official told Axios  that the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\".\n\nGreene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues.\n\n\"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greene  told POLITICO . \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\"\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\n\nEven beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too.\n\nHis public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps.\n\nTrump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party.\n\n\"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN.\n\nReferring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\"\n\nBut as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party.\n\n\"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files.\n\nTrump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-saudi-crown-prince-visit.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:25:07-05:00","title":"Trump Lauds Saudi Prince in Lavish Visit, Brushing Off Journalist’s Killing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House in a lavish, symbolic event, praising him as a close friend and business partner despite U.S. intelligence reports linking the crown prince to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

And in a remarkable Oval Office outburst, Mr. Trump defended him against a U.S. intelligence report that he had ordered the murder of a journalist.\n\nIt was a chummy scene that underscored the president’s desire to maintain strong relations with Saudi Arabia during a tumultuous period in the Middle East. Mr. Trump’s defense of his guest obscured the crown prince’s role in cracking down on domestic dissent and in the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, in 2018.\n\n“We’ve been really good friends for a long period of time,” Mr. Trump told reporters, cabinet officials and members of the Saudi delegation who had gathered there. “We’ve always been on the same side of every issue.”\n\nThe 42-minute appearance contained plenty of talk about business deals and diplomatic partnerships, as well as a presidential fit over pointed questions from reporters that was striking even for Mr. Trump, who is no stranger to televised dramatics. As he berated a reporter for asking about Mr. Khashoggi’s murder and about people who have accused the Saudi government of supporting the hijackers behind the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Trump brushed off the killing, appearing even more agitated about the question than his guest of honor.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Khashoggi. Mr. Trump defended the crown prince, who sat next to him, looking down and inspecting his hands: “Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”\n\nThroughout their joint appearance, Mr. Trump seemed more interested in producing a smooth, lavish visit that could pave the way for up to $1 trillion of Saudi investment into the United States than the implications of the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies. During the Biden administration, U.S. intelligence officials released a report that determined that the crown prince had ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, but declined to take direction against the crown prince. Prince Mohammed has denied his involvement.\n\nSimilarly, during his first term, Mr. Trump had defended President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who denied to Mr. Trump that his government had any involvement in meddling in the 2016 election, despite the findings of the U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n“I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia,” Mr. Trump said at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump heaped praise and state-dinner-style honors upon the crown prince, whom he has long treated like a business partner instead of a pariah. When his guest arrived at the southern entrance of the White House, military officers on horseback trotted across the drive, flying Saudi and American flags. The treatment was more ostentatious than most visiting dignitaries receive, even for state visits.\n\nAdding to the ceremony was a military band, and a flyover that included several F-35 fighter jets. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he intended to sell the advanced aircraft to the Saudis, a decision that would need congressional approval. Other agreements came together, including one on artificial intelligence, a mutual defense pact and an agreement that would eventually offer Saudi Arabia access to the United States’ nuclear technology.\n\nThe crown prince was set to be honored Tuesday night at a welcome ceremony and a black-tie dinner at the White House attended by major business leaders, including the billionaire and former Trump adviser Elon Musk. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to participate with the president in an investment conference at Washington’s Kennedy Center.\n\nAhead of the visit, Mr. Trump had hinted that he wanted the Saudis to agree to normalize relations with Israel and sign onto the Abraham Accords, a set of diplomatic agreements that normalized relations between Israel and three Arab states during the first Trump administration.\n\nBut it was clear that was not on the table for this visit. “Israel will be very happy,” Mr. Trump insisted, when pressed about failing to secure Saudi Arabia’s commitment on that front. “Israel is aware, and they’re going to be very happy.”\n\nTo fulfill the rest of his 20-point plan to rebuild Gaza and his desire to increase participation in the Abraham Accords, Mr. Trump will need to keep the Saudis engaged, analysts said.\n\n“Part of his incentive is to wine and dine the Saudi leadership and lay the groundwork for that eventuality of normalizing with Israel,” said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Quincy Institute, a foreign policy think tank. But, he added, “from the Saudi point of view, they’re getting a lot of the package that had been put forward, without normalizing.”\n\nOn Tuesday, all of those details seemed secondary to Mr. Trump’s interest in showing off the White House, which he is remodeling in his image.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump stopped to show the prince a wall of presidential portraits, including the photo of an autopen hanging in the space where the portrait of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would be. And the president made clear he was not interested in giving any credit to a predecessor whose administration had opted to preserve the strategic relationship between the two countries rather than take direct action against the crown prince for Mr. Khashoggi’s murder.\n\n“Trump doesn’t give a fist bump,” Mr. Trump said, referring to himself, and also to the greeting between Mr. Biden and the crown prince in 2022. He gestured to the crown prince: “I grabbed that hand. I don’t give a hell where that hand’s been. I grabbed that.”\n\nMr. Trump also seemed eager to establish his friendship with the crown prince.\n\n“I can call him almost any time,” Mr. Trump said. “When you love your job, when you love your country, and when you’re in a position like we are — future king, highly respected crown prince, and in my case, president, you’re thinking about your country.”\n\nThe Trump family business has also reaped the benefits of closely working with Saudi Arabia. This week, the Trump Organization and its Saudi-based development partner, Dar Al Arkan, announced a new project allowing cryptocurrency investors to buy into Trump-branded real estate projects using digital tokens that can be bought and sold on a blockchain platform. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has been helping with the Middle East peace process, runs a private equity firm that has taken $2 billion from a fund led by the crown prince.\n\nMr. Kushner was not expected to attend the dinner, but Mr. Trump’s son, Don Jr., was expected to attend, according to a White House official familiar with the guest list.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, when the crown prince left the White House, some members of the Saudi delegation carried red gift bags with the president’s signature embossed on them, which they loaded into a waiting vehicle before departing.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-epstein-files.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:59:49-05:00","title":"For Trump, Epstein Is the Story That Won’t Go Away","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump's repeated denials and efforts to suppress attention, the Epstein files — which detail allegations of sex trafficking and connections between Epstein and powerful figures — have persisted as a major political issue.

the Story That Won’t Go Away\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T17:59:49-05:00\n\nIt’s the one story line President Trump hasn’t been able to evade.\n\nDuring his first term and now in his second, Mr. Trump has managed to deflect and defeat news cycles he views as negative to him, often by quickly diverting the media and public’s attention to a new topic.\n\nWith a “flood the zone” strategy of doing everything, everywhere, all at once, Mr. Trump often generates multiple news cycles per day. White House officials believe that when the news is focused on immigration, crime or the president’s peacemaking efforts abroad, Mr. Trump is winning. As such, if Mr. Trump doesn’t like one news cycle, he can fire off an all-caps Truth Social post and create another.\n\nBut the Epstein files — which carry with them a constant reminder of the president’s friendship with a sex offender — have dogged him in a way few other issues have. Nothing Mr. Trump has tried to do to get them out of the news has worked.\n\nMr. Trump has sought to distract from the files, complaining that the public should focus instead on his administration’s successes. He ordered Republicans to stop talking about them. He tried to bully House Republicans into killing their effort to get them released. When his attempts failed, an increasingly frustrated Mr. Trump threatened primary campaigns against G.O.P. members who cross him, and even accused one of his biggest supporters of being a “traitor.”\n\nBut the lawmakers pushing for the files to be released have defeated the master of attention domination.\n\nWith Mr. Trump set to lose a vote in the House over the release of the files, the president on Sunday reluctantly embraced the legislation to call on his own administration to release the documents it was withholding. Mr. Trump made clear he was doing so only grudgingly, still referring to the files as nothing more than a “hoax.” Mr. Trump has denied any involvement in or knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House voted 427 to 1 to force the Trump administration to release more files from the investigation into Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking minors. The Senate quickly moved to pass the measure as well.\n\n“There is hope here,” said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, one of the sponsors of the bill that so angered Mr. Trump. “We fought the president, the attorney general, the F.B.I. director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win.”\n\nMr. Massie said he had little optimism of forcing the release of the files when he started the effort, but Republican women rallied around the cause. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina were some of the most committed supporters, crossing the president and demanding any information from the files that could shed light on the abuse of women and girls.\n\n“They were pressured in ways that you cannot even imagine, and they stood strong, and that’s why we’re here today,” Mr. Massie said. “They didn’t take us seriously over at the executive branch or in the Senate, because they always thought they could flip one of these women, they could convince them or control them, or intimidate them into taking their names off of this petition, but they did not succeed.”\n\nMs. Greene said Mr. Trump’s attacks on her over the Epstein files had subjected her to a torrent of threats. At a news conference on Tuesday at the Capitol with women who said they were victims of Mr. Epstein’s abuse, Ms. Greene responded to the president.\n\n“He called me a traitor for standing with these women,” Ms. Greene said. “Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves.”\n\nFor years, the allegations of sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein — and his close connections to the rich and powerful — have fueled a desire for the release of more documents about his case to expose any other potential abusers. During his 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump said he would release the files as president.\n\nBut the Epstein case quickly turned Washington politics upside down.\n\nIn the early days of Mr. Trump’s second term, releasing the files was an intense focus of the Trump administration. More than 1,000 F.B.I. employees, some of them on 24-hour shifts, were ordered to review the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi released binders full of documents titled “The Epstein Files, Phase 1.”\n\nBut there was never a “Phase 2.”\n\nInstead, the Justice Department released an unsigned memo in July saying that its review of the files “revealed no incriminating ‘client list.’”\n\nBy this time, Ms. Bondi had already informed Mr. Trump that his name appeared in the files.\n\nThe politics on the issue shifted. Democrats sensed the administration had grown defensive, and loudly joined calls to release the files.\n\nMr. Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill, including Speaker Mike Johnson, fought the passage of what’s known as a “discharge petition” to demand that the Justice Department release all of its investigation files. They even went so far as to shut down the House early in July, grinding the legislative business of Washington to a halt.\n\nAlthough Mr. Johnson voted for the measure on Tuesday, he derided it as a “show vote” and a “political weapon.” The speaker has circulated a legal memo outlining what he says are the “dangers” of the discharge petition, including what he says is the airing of “noncredible allegations” against “innocent persons.”\n\n“They’re trying to attack President Trump,” Mr. Johnson said.\n\nDespite his newfound support of the measure, Mr. Trump made clear Tuesday he was not happy about it.\n\nWhen an ABC News reporter in the Oval Office asked Mr. Trump about releasing the files, the president lashed out.\n\n“You’re a terrible person and a terrible reporter,” Mr. Trump said, adding: “As far as the Epstein files, I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p3x7vr34o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:54:09.273+00:00","title":"Shelters plea for Gazans as winter rains raise fears of more disease and death","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As heavy winter rains hit Gaza, over 260,000 families—about 1.5 million people—are facing life-threatening conditions due to a lack of shelter.

Gazans as winter rains raise fears of more disease and death\n\nAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\n\n\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\n\n\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"\n\nWith a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.\n\nThey have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday.\n\nThere are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\n\n\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\n\n\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"\n\nThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\n\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.\n\nHer family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.\n\n\"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"\n\nA recent UN report found that across Gaza  more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City .\n\nAccording to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.\n\nThe NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.\n\nThey say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.\n\nJan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up.\n\nIn March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.\n\nHowever, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.\n\nMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.\n\nCogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\".\n\nIt said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\".\n\nOn Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"\n\nIt said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".\n\nInternational aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.\n\nWith a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\n\n\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.\n\n\"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"\n\nPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.\n\nThey say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.\n\nThere are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\n\n\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\n\n\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\n\nIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.\n\nHe said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\n\n\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"\n\nLike all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\n\n\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"\n\nCorrection 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:11:42.806+00:00","title":"When will the Epstein files be released now that the Senate agreed to make them public?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Congress has passed a bipartisan resolution requiring the Justice Department to release all files related to the investigation of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days, in a searchable and downloadable format.

agreed to make them public?\n\nThe US Congress has approved a measure to compel the US Justice Department to release all files pertaining to its investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday and the Senate agreed to pass it upon arrival.\n\nIt next needs the sign-off of President Donald Trump. The president urged Republicans in Congress on Monday to vote for the release - reversing course after his administration declined to make them public.\n\nHe had faced pushback from Epstein victims and a potential revolt from Republicans who would would vote to force the files' release.\n\nCongress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill to advocate for the bill's passage and to hold news conferences with reporters.\n\nNearly all the House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, was the only representative who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee have already  made public thousands of documents  from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution passed on Tuesday covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.\n\nThat material could, in theory, include files pertaining to imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as people - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nThe vote comes just  two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure . In the post, he argued that \"we have nothing to hide\".\n\nBefore Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate quickly agreed to pass the measure on Tuesday evening.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune had previously suggested that while he was \"not hearing\" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that.\n\nThe Republican has been under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer requested unanimous consent on the Senate floor to \"immediately\" pass the bill to release all the unclassified files. No one objected so the measure was approved.\n\nAnother Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, had previously told NBC's Meet the Press only that the Senate would \"take a look\" at the bill if it passes the House.\n\n\"We'll see what it says,\" Barrasso said. \"We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.\"\n\n\"This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,\" he added. \"And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"\n\nThe bill will head from the Senate to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday night, he said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".\n\n\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nTrump went on to argue the Epstein scandal was a \"hoax\" distracting from \"the greatness of what the Republican Party had accomplished over the last period of time\".\n\nAs the Senate agreed to pass the bill on Tuesday, Trump said that it didn't matter to him and cast the whole thing as a distraction.\n\n\"I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had,\" he wrote in a social media post, listing wins that ranged from  the passage of his budget bill over the summer  to the end of the 43-day government shutdown.\n\nThere are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill.\n\nThe text of the document that went before the House, for example, noted that the attorney general could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,\" he added.\n\nThe House bill also noted that the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton  and Larry Summers , \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Prof Entin said. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nDoing so, he added, \"might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation\" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought.\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.\n\n\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Representative Thomas Massie said on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in  a public row with Trump over the files ,  has also said the documents may be \"tied up\" in Trump's investigation into Democrats.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,\" Greene told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,\" Greene added. \"But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-covert-action-venezuela.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:10:50-05:00","title":"Trump Said to Authorize C.I.A.

Plans for Covert Action in Venezuela\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T19:10:50-05:00\n\nWith the largest U.S. aircraft carrier now positioned in the Caribbean, President Trump has approved additional measures to pressure Venezuela and prepare for the possibility of a broader military campaign, according to multiple people briefed on the matter.\n\nMr. Trump has signed off on C.I.A. plans for covert measures inside Venezuela, operations that could be meant to prepare a battlefield for further action, these people said. At the same time, they said, he has authorized a new round of back-channel negotiations that at one point resulted in President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela offering to step down after a delay of a couple of years, a proposal the White House rejected.\n\nIt is not clear what the covert actions might be or when any of them might be carried out. Mr. Trump has not yet authorized combat forces on the ground in Venezuela, so the next phase of the administration’s escalating pressure campaign on the Maduro government could be sabotage or some sort of cyber, psychological or information operations.\n\nThe president has not made a decision about the broader course of action to pursue in Venezuela, nor publicly articulated his ultimate goal beyond stemming the flow of drugs from the region. And military and C.I.A. planners have prepared multiple options for different contingencies.\n\nMilitary planners have prepared lists of potential drug facilities that could be struck. The Pentagon is also planning for strikes on military units close to Mr. Maduro. Mr. Trump held two meetings in the White House Situation Room last week to discuss Venezuela and review options with his senior advisers.\n\nAny covert action by the C.I.A. would probably come before such military strikes.\n\nBoth the White House and the C.I.A. declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s order.\n\nEven as Mr. Trump has told the C.I.A. to prepare multiple possible secret operations inside Venezuela, he has also opened up back-channel negotiations with Mr. Maduro after cutting off such talks last month for a brief time, people briefed on the matter said.\n\nIn those informal talks, Mr. Maduro has signaled a willingness to offer access to his country’s oil wealth to American energy companies.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged those talks, in a fashion, on Sunday.\n\n“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump emphasizes Venezuela’s role in the drug trade or illegal immigration when he discusses the issue in public, he has discussed in private the country’s huge oil reserves and American companies gaining access to them.\n\nVenezuelan officials have told Americans that Mr. Maduro might be willing to step down, after a transition of two to three years, according to the people briefed on the matter. Any delay in Mr. Maduro’s giving up power is a nonstarter with the White House.\n\nBut despite the apparent impasse, the back-channel negotiations show that a diplomatic solution is still possible.\n\nPeople briefed on the discussions say it is not clear what outcome the president favors. Mr. Trump could agree to a diplomatic deal to gain more access to the Venezuela oil resources for American companies, he could push for a resolution that allows Mr. Maduro to voluntarily give up power, or he could demand that the United States forcibly remove the Venezuelan dictator.\n\nEven with the endgame uncertain, the White House has settled on a strategy of ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. Maduro, while giving Mr. Trump options on how he might want to bring the campaign against Venezuela to a conclusion.\n\nCalled “Operation Southern Spear,” the massive buildup of American naval forces in the Caribbean is the largest since the Cuban Missile Crisis and the blockade of Cuba in 1962. The carrier Gerald R. Ford arrived in the Caribbean over the weekend, and there are now 15,000 troops in the region, including Marines on amphibious ships and personnel at military bases in Puerto Rico.\n\nBut the military buildup is only the most obvious of a multifaceted pressure campaign.\n\nThe State Department has announced that, effective Nov. 24, it will designate Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization. While Cartel de los Soles is not a cartel in the traditional sense, it is a way for the Trump administration to label a broad swath of Mr. Maduro’s government a terrorism organization, potentially paving the way for military action but also pressuring the government.\n\nMr. Trump’s public comments in recent days have reflected the uncertainty over the endgame, even as he increases the pressure. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he had not ruled out ground forces going into Venezuela, and held out the possibility of direct negotiations with Mr. Maduro.\n\n“I don’t rule out anything,” Mr. Trump said. “We just have to take care of Venezuela.”\n\nThe United States has launched 21 known strikes on boats that the administration says were smuggling drugs, killing at least 83 people. Mr. Trump has said ample intelligence justifies the strikes, but administration officials have not provided detailed evidence of the cargo the boats were carrying.\n\nThose strikes have been conducted without congressional authorization, prompting criticism from legal experts and Democrats in Congress that the administration is intentionally targeting civilians who may be suspected of crimes but are not combatants.\n\nMr. Trump, at least after the first strikes in October, said the United States had targeted fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that has caused tens of thousands of overdose deaths. But military officials, in closed door meetings with Congress, have acknowledged that the boats are carrying cocaine, not fentanyl.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3de4dqvk8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:01:39.100+00:00","title":"Why India's poorest state continues to struggle with illegal alcohol sales","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban in 2016, Bihar—India’s poorest state—continues to struggle with illegal alcohol sales despite official claims of success.

India's poorest state continues to struggle with illegal alcohol sales\n\nNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.\n\nThe gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.\n\nArmed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.\n\nOn reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.\n\nVapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.\n\nThe officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived.\n\n\"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said.\n\nDespite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.\n\nPassed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.\n\nState officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.\n\nMore than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar.\n\nIn the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state.\n\nSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?\n\nLocal police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\n\n\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.\n\nMr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\n\n\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.\n\nBihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.\n\nDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.\n\nIn Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\n\n\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.\n\nNeetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\n\n\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.\n\nRajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\n\n\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.\n\nBihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.\n\nThe financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.\n\nGujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.\n\nMizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.\n\nSome other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.\n\nFor now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.\n\nWhether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   Twitter  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-saudi-dinner-guests.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:26:48-05:00","title":"Who Is Attending Trump’s Dinner for the Saudi Crown Prince?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is hosting a black-tie dinner at the White House for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, marking a significant diplomatic reset after the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi.

He has grown close to Mr. Trump as the United States prepares to co-host the World Cup in 2026.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Infantino is also close to Prince Mohammed, and helped award Saudi Arabia the World Cup in 2034. FIFA’s president openly campaigned for the Saudi World Cup bid, pushed for Saudi investment in the sport and created rules for World Cup hosts that all but ensured that the Gulf State would get to hold the event.\n\n— Ryan Mac\n\nMr. Musk, the world’s richest man, is making his first visit to the White House since he left his role in the administration in dramatic fashion, lashing out at Mr. Trump. The two have reached something of a détente in recent months.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Musk has had a frosty relationship with Saudi leaders that has thawed in recent months. For years, the billionaire has blamed the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, for pulling out of his failed effort to take Tesla private, and has criticized the state’s position on “journalistic freedom of speech.” But Mr. Musk has also accepted Saudi investment in X, his social media site, and xAI, his artificial intelligence company. Humain, a state-backed A.I. company in Saudi Arabia, has hinted it would do deals with xAI.\n\n— Theodore Schleifer and Ryan Mac\n\nDavid Ellison is the chief executive of Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, MTV and Hollywood’s oldest movie studio.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Ellison is trying to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in what would be a major multibillion dollar media deal. Mr. Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, is backing those efforts, but the Saudi sovereign wealth fund could be part of the deal.\n\n— Lauren Hirsch\n\nMr. Wirth is the chief executive of Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Chevron has extensive business ties with Saudi Arabia, where one of its corporate ancestors, Standard Oil of California, began exploring for crude oil nearly a century ago. Chevron now produces oil and natural gas on the kingdom’s behalf in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Such partnerships between U.S. oil companies and foreign governments or state-owned energy companies are quite common. Chevron, which said it has “a long history of productive cooperation in the kingdom,” also has financial interests in chemicals plants there, and buys Saudi oil.\n\n— Rebecca F. Elliott\n\nMr. Schwarzman is the chief executive and co-founder of Blackstone, a large New York-based private equity firm.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Blackstone, which manages $1.25 trillion in assets, has been doing business with Saudi Arabia for many years. During Mr. Trump’s first state visit to the kingdom in 2017, Blackstone announced that the sovereign wealth fund would make an investment of up to $20 billion for a project Blackstone was launching to invest in U.S. infrastructure. Over the years, Mr. Schwarzman has traveled frequently to Riyadh to meet with his Saudi investors and to participate in the kingdom’s annual investment conference. More recently, a Blackstone-backed company called Air Trunk announced plans to help build data centers in Saudi Arabia.\n\n— Kate Kelly\n\nMs. Barra is the chief executive of General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia is the largest car market in the Middle East. G.M. sells Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles in a market dominated by Japanese, Korean and, increasingly, Chinese brands. Her presence may also reflect a desire to maintain good relations with Mr. Trump. His tariffs on imported cars and parts have cost G.M. and other carmakers billions of dollars in profits.\n\n— Jack Ewing\n\nMr. Ford is the executive chairman of Ford Motor.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Ford recently revamped its management team in Saudi Arabia and has reported brisk growth in the Middle East’s largest car market. But Mr. Ford is probably most interested in maintaining good relations with Mr. Trump, whose tariffs and other policies have had a significant impact on Ford’s business.\n\n— Jack Ewing\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is Mr. Trump’s oldest son, and helps lead the family business, the Trump Organization, with Eric Trump, his younger brother.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Mr. Trump served as a liaison to Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, for his father’s presidential campaign in 2016. After Mr. Khashoggi’s murder in 2018, he also spread an unsubstantiated claim that Mr. Khashoggi had been a terrorist sympathizer. The Trump Organization has a long history of business dealings with Saudi Arabia, ranging from real estate deals in the Middle East to hosting Saudi-backed golf tournaments at Trump properties. Since Mr. Trump’s return to the White House, his sons have also secured a flurry of new real estate deals, including three new developments in Saudi Arabia. More talks are ongoing.\n\n— Minho Kim and Adam Sella\n\nMs. Powell McCormick is the head of global client services at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank and investment firm, and served as a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Trump in his first term. She is married to Senator Dave McCormick, Republican of Pennsylvania and a former money management executive at Bridgewater Associates.\n\nTies to Saudi Arabia: Both Ms. Powell McCormick and Mr. McCormick have served in Republican White Houses. As a partner at Goldman Sachs, Ms. Powell McCormick oversaw relationships with sovereign wealth funds, including Saudi Arabia’s. She also sits on the executive committee of the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the group that sponsors Saudi Arabia’s annual deal-making conference in Riyadh.\n\n— Kate Kelly and Lauren Hirsch\n\nRyan Mac, Kate Kelly, Lauren Hirsch, Jack Ewing, Katie Rogers, Rebecca Elliott, Minho Kim, Adam Sella and Theodore Schleifer contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-19","timeOfPublication":"00:23:14.958+00:00","title":"On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's shadow fleet","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the growing threat posed by Russia’s 'shadow fleet'—a network of tankers using false or invalid flags to circumvent Western sanctions on Russian oil exports.

western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.\n\n\"Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.\"\n\nThrough heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\n\n\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.\n\nThis is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nAfter the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.\n\nSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.\n\nOut on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.\n\nAs the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.\n\nThat is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".\n\nDriven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.\n\nThe BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.\n\nThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.\n\nThe rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.\n\nWhat's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"\n\nWe spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nJourneying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.\n\nThe BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.\n\nTracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.\n\nOriginally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.\n\nBack in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea -  which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.\n\nBy late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.\n\nThe tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.\n\nIn August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.\n\nThe BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called  FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered.\n\nThe beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.\n\nOpaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.\n\nPurged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.\n\nUnity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.\n\nBy 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.\n\nThe tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.\n\nBack in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly  detained  at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.\n\nUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to  UK and EU service and port bans  as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.\n\nNevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nAnalysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air  finds  that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.\n\nWhile politicians  talk of toughening action , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.\n\nThe right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.\n\nCountries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\n\n\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"\n\nThe Estonians speak from experience.\n\nWhen they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.\n\nThe fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\n\n\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\n\n\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"\n\nBack on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\n\n\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.\n\nThe exchange lasted just over five minutes.\n\n\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"\n\nBut as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"\n\nThere is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".\n\nThe BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\n\n\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.\n\nIt was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/world/americas/ecuador-us-military-base-vote-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:03:41-05:00","title":"Ecuador Votes No to Hosting U.S. Military Base","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ecuador’s voters rejected a referendum proposing a U.S. military base by a 61% to 39% margin, signaling a sharp reversal for President Daniel Noboa.

Votes No to Hosting U.S. Military Base\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T12:03:41-05:00\n\nPresident Daniel Noboa of Ecuador has spent months courting Washington. He has met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago; formed an alliance with the Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a Trump supporter; and pressed to allow U.S. military bases in Ecuador.\n\nBut voters at home delivered Mr. Noboa a sharp rebuke.\n\nThey soundly rejected a national referendum on Sunday that he had backed, aimed at authorizing a foreign miliary presence in Ecuador. With more than 98 percent of ballots counted, 61 percent opposed the measure.\n\nThe vote comes as the region has been roiled by the intensifying U.S. military campaign against boats the Trump administration claims are smuggling drugs.\n\nThe American military has launched 21 strikes that have killed at least 83 people, though U.S. officials have yet to provide evidence that the boats were ferrying drugs. Many legal experts say the attacks violate international law.\n\nStill, analysts said the rejection of the referendum in Ecuador reflected not necessarily unhappiness with the U.S. military campaign but rather widespread distrust and dissatisfaction with Mr. Noboa himself.\n\nOnce seen as an oasis of peace in South America, Ecuador has had an explosion in drug violence in recent years, which Mr. Noboa campaigned on tackling. But after his two years in office, homicides are rising, and many prisons are effectively controlled by gangs. Some analysts predict that this year could become the most violent in Ecuador’s history.\n\nVarious crises have heightened a sense that the government is incapable of containing violence and providing basic services. The problems include clashes set off by cuts to government fuel subsidies, which left three civilians dead; a series of urban explosions; three prison massacres; and a worsening medicine shortage.\n\n“He didn’t lose because of Trump — he lost for promising transformation without administrative credibility,” said Pamela León, an analyst based in Guayaquil. “The decisive message was domestic.”\n\nMr. Noboa, who has not said anything publicly about the U.S. airstrikes, had argued that an American military presence in the country would help his government fight criminal organizations.\n\nUnder Rafael Correa, who was president from 2007 to 2017, Ecuador’s relations with the United States deteriorated, and he expelled American military forces. Analysts say the expulsion undermined border security and allowed transnational drug traffickers to expand their operations.\n\nEcuador’s constitution prohibits foreign military bases and requires a referendum to change this.\n\nIn September, Mr. Noboa hosted the U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who pledged to provide $20 million in security aid, including for drones. This month, Mr. Noboa and Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, toured sites for potential U.S. military bases.\n\nJust days before the vote, he signed an agreement with the United States to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports in exchange for the United States’ removing levies on some Ecuadorean exports.\n\nEcuadoreans generally value good relations with the United States, but many voters seemed to believe that the referendum lacked clear plans for improving security, said Caroline Ávila Nieto, an Ecuadorean political analyst.\n\nMr. Noboa has raised taxes to help finance his plans for reducing violence, Ms. Ávila said, but the security problem has worsened.\n\nThe president has also offered confusing messages about the proposed U.S. military base, including proposing a location in the Galápagos Islands. That alarmed many Ecuadoreans who consider the islands, a biodiverse tourist attraction, a source of national pride.\n\nMr. Noboa also recently pushed through tax-amnesty legislation that essentially erased a decades-old tax debt owed by his family’s banana-exporting business, a move that critics said undercut his credibility. Mr. Noboa is from one of Ecuador’s wealthiest families, and its empire was built on bananas.\n\nThe outcome was a sharp reversal for the 37-year-old president, who surged unexpectedly in the polls to win a shortened presidential term in 2023. Last year, he won broad public backing in a referendum for a separate package of security changes.\n\nIn April, he won a decisive re-election, relying on a law-and-order platform, a deft command of social media to project an image of youth and vigor, and a plea that he needed more time.\n\n“The honeymoon period has ended; the public is no longer giving him that space or trust,” said Glaeldys González Calanche, who researches Ecuador for the International Crisis Group. “Now people want to see change and results. The narrative of needing more time is no longer resonating.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/trump-education-department.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:08:34-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Announces Steps to Dismantle Education Department","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced a sweeping plan to dismantle the Department of Education, transferring core programs to other federal agencies such as the Labor, Health and Human Services, State, and Interior departments.

Tuesday an aggressive plan to continue dismantling the Education Department, ending the agency’s broad role in supporting academics at elementary and high schools and in expanding access to college.\n\nThose responsibilities, which had been overseen by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Office of Postsecondary Education, will instead be largely taken over by the Labor Department.\n\nAdditional changes include moving a child care grant program for college students and foreign medical school accreditation to the Health and Human Services Department, and transferring Fulbright programs and international education grants to the State Department. The Interior Department will take over the Indian Education Office.\n\nShifting duties away from the Education Department aligns with President Trump’s goal of eventually closing the agency, a move opposed by teachers’ unions and student rights groups and one that can only be accomplished with an act of Congress.\n\nLess clear was how moving programs to other agencies aligned with Mr. Trump’s reason for closing the Education Department, which he has said was to give states more power in shaping school policies. A senior official at the Education Department said the changes would streamline bureaucracy and direct more money to the classroom.\n\n“Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement, adding that the changes were an attempt to “refocus education on students, families and schools.”\n\nSeveral of the changes had been outlined in Project 2025, a right-wing playbook for remaking the federal government. The lead author of the education chapter, Lindsey Burke, is Ms. McMahon’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs.\n\nBut the plan drew immediate blowback from some Republicans, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said in a statement that the “department’s core offices are not discretionary functions.”\n\n“They are foundational,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “They safeguard civil rights, expand opportunity, and ensure that every child, in every community, has the chance to learn, grow and succeed on equal footing.”\n\nKevin Carey, the vice president for education and work at New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the changes were “wasteful, wrong and illegal.”\n\n“Secretary McMahon is creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg machine that will waste millions of taxpayer dollars by outsourcing vital programs to other agencies,” Mr. Carey said.\n\nBecky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, criticized the administration for announcing the changes during American Education Week. (Mr. Trump released a statement on Monday trumpeting his plan to close the department in which he noted the week’s designation, which is intended to celebrate public schools and educators.)\n\n“Not only do they want to starve and steal from our students — they want to rob them of their futures,” Ms. Pringle said.\n\nRepresentative Tim Walberg of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, defended the moves, saying the administration was “making good on its promise to fix the nation’s broken system by right-sizing the Department of Education.”\n\nAbout 10 cents of every dollar spent on local schools comes from the federal government, according to congressional estimates.\n\nAdministration officials have pointed to the recent federal shutdown to justify the moves, noting that schools remained open and students continued to be taught despite nearly all of the Education Department’s staff having been furloughed.\n\nThe department has posted several social media memes making such a point. In an X post last week, the department announced that federal workers were returning to the office, adding, “But let’s be honest: did you really miss us at all?”\n\nLiz Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was committed to shrinking the agency “while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs.”\n\n“The Democrat shutdown made one thing unmistakably clear: Students and teachers don’t need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms,” Ms. Huston said.\n\nThe Office of Elementary and Secondary Education oversees about $28 billion in grant funding that will be administered by the Labor Department, according to administration officials. About $3 billion in grants for the Office of Postsecondary Education were also affected.\n\nThe elementary and secondary office includes about three dozen programs that provide funding for low-income schools. While statutory oversight for those programs will remain with the Education Department, the agency is effectively contracting with the Labor Department to administer nearly all of the grants.\n\nThe postsecondary office grants to be moved include TRIO, which supports programs that are designed to support low-income and first-generation college students and students with disabilities. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked Ms. McMahon about TRIO programs during a confirmation hearing earlier this year, saying they were a high priority for her.\n\n“How do we maintain the administration and oversight of these programs if we abolish or substantially reorganize the Department of Education?” Ms. Collins asked.\n\nMs. McMahon responded by saying she was “not looking to defund or reduce any of those amounts” spent on those programs.\n\nRepublicans in charge of the House and Senate in Washington have signaled little enthusiasm for voting on a bill to close the department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.\n\nMr. Trump has also shown little interest in collaborating with Congress in his bid to reshape the federal government, and his administration has continued to seek ways to diminish the Education Department.\n\n“We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said in March after signing an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start razing the department.\n\nMs. McMahon’s first act after joining Mr. Trump’s cabinet this year was to instruct the department’s staff to prepare for its “final mission” of shuttering the agency. The following week, Ms. McMahon fired 1,315 of those workers.\n\nThe layoffs decimated the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which was created to enforce Congress’s promise of equal educational opportunity for all students, and eliminated the agency’s research arm dedicated to tracking U.S. student achievement, which for many students is at three-decade lows.\n\nIn July, after the Supreme Court cleared the way for mass layoffs at the department, the administration moved adult education, family literacy programs and career and technical education to the Labor Department.\n\nMr. Trump had previously targeted the Small Business Administration as a landing spot for the nation’s $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio.\n\nMs. McMahon has also spoken publicly about the possibility of shifting programs for disabled students to the health department and responsibilities for civil rights enforcement in schools to the Justice Department.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/texas-ten-commandments.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:44:10-05:00","title":"Federal Judge Orders Some Texas Schools to Remove Ten Commandment Posters","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, Judge Orlando L.

Garcia, of U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, comes after Gov. Greg Abbott signed in June a law requiring school districts to display the Ten Commandments in a “conspicuous location” in each classroom. The ruling applies to 14 public school districts, including ones in Fort Worth, Arlington and Conroe.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Garcia wrote that “it is impracticable, if not impossible, to prevent plaintiffs from being subjected to unwelcome religious displays” without stopping school districts from enforcing that law.\n\nThe decision comes amid an ongoing battle over whether states can legally compel school districts to display the Ten Commandments. In June, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said a similar law in Louisiana requiring the postings was “plainly unconstitutional.” The State of Louisiana asked the full appeals court to rehear the case, and a hearing is scheduled for Jan. 20. The court will also hear a challenge to Texas’ law in that hearing.\n\nThe Fort Worth Independent School District and Conroe Independent School District said in separate statements on Tuesday that they would comply with Judge Garcia’s order. Other districts could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nTexas’ law states that school districts must accept donations of the posters, but are not required to purchase them with district funds. Proponents of the law argue that the Ten Commandments are important to understanding U.S. history, while critics say the law is a clear violation of the separation of church and state.\n\n“America is a Christian nation, and it is imperative that we display the very values and timeless truths that have historically guided the success of our country,” Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said in a statement this month. Mr. Paxton has sued at least three districts that he says have refused to display donated posters of the Ten Commandments. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn August, a separate federal judge in the Western District of Texas temporarily halted the law, while its constitutionality was being litigated. But that decision applied to 11 school districts, and some other districts proceeded to hang the posters that were donated, sometimes by religious organizations.\n\n“I am relieved that as a result of today’s ruling, my children, who are among a small number of Jewish children at their schools, will no longer be continually subjected to religious displays,” Lenee Bien-Willner, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement shared by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which represented the plaintiffs. “The government has no business interfering with parental decisions about matters of faith.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/robyn-mccutcheon-diplomat-transgender-refuge-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"09:59:07-05:00","title":"As Rights Are Taken Away, a Transgender Trailblazer Seeks Refuge Abroad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robyn McCutcheon, the first American diplomat to come out as transgender, became a trailblazer in federal LGBTQ+ advocacy.

The first American diplomat to come out as transgender, she was bracing for an upsetting inaugural address.\n\nAfter all, the new president had pledged to roll back foreign assistance, impose protectionist tariffs and abandon climate change investments — policies that would undermine much of the work she had championed representing the United States abroad. That was hard for her, but she expected all of it.\n\nBut she was caught off guard when, minutes into his address, Mr. Trump touched on the issue most central to her legacy.\n\n“As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,” he said.\n\nMs. McCutcheon was watching from a rented apartment in Astana, the futuristic capital of Kazakhstan, the nation where she had spent some of the happiest years of her State Department career. Now retired, she was back in Kazakhstan to see friends and perhaps establish a part-time home in the region.\n\nWhen the speech ended, Ms. McCutcheon rose from the stiff sofa. It was nearly 11 p.m., the temperature just below zero. Her thoughts churned as she looked out on the snow-draped skyline and a frozen sliver of the Esil River.\n\nWhat did Mr. Trump’s transgender policy mean? Would the passport identifying her as a woman be confiscated? Was medical care for transgender people at risk? Would it feel safe to return to her bucolic retirement cabin in Maine?\n\n“I think I’ve lost my country,” Ms. McCutcheon, 71, recalled thinking that night. “This is not the America I thought I had represented or that I grew up in.”\n\nThe question now was whether to go back at all.\n\nMs. McCutcheon’s first inkling of her desire to become a woman came in a dream when she was 5 or 6, living in an old farmhouse in Rockland County, on the outskirts of New York City. Lost in the woods, she found a warmly lit house only girls could enter and was welcomed inside. For years, she yearned for a replay of the dream, in vain.\n\nIn later years, she strapped a funnel to the vacuum cleaner and pressed it to her chest to see if it would make her breasts grow. As an astronomy student at the University of Virginia, she began privately wearing women’s clothing after reading “Conundrum,” a memoir by the transgender writer Jan Morris.\n\nBut as college graduation neared, she tossed out the wardrobe and tried to tune out what she called her gender “white noise” by preparing for demanding postgraduate studies, which led to degrees in celestial mechanics and Russian at Yale and Georgetown.\n\nWorking as an independent researcher early in her career, Ms. McCutcheon traveled to the Soviet Union to study the mistreatment of astronomers during the Stalin era. She now believes she was driven by an unconscious desire to understand how people had faced oppression. She later worked for a government contractor that played a key role in building and deploying the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nShe married a woman in 1982, hoping it would throttle her gender dysphoria, but their strained marriage made her secret feel more daunting. In 1990, soon after their only son was born, Ms. McCutcheon had a few shots of vodka and came clean to her wife, who she said was hurt and angry.\n\nSoon, Ms. McCutcheon sought treatment at a psychiatric hospital at the urging of one of her sisters after she came close to jumping in front of a train. A psychotherapist told her that the root of her problems was workaholism and depression, not gender dissonance.\n\nIn the years that followed, Ms. McCutcheon attended Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings in a futile attempt to feel different. Later, she joined an online forum called No Transition, a support group for closeted, married transgender people.\n\nThe offramp to finally transition came in 2004, when, at 50, Ms. McCutcheon accepted a job as a career diplomat at the State Department.\n\nMs. McCutcheon had long loved to travel, particularly to Russian-speaking countries. And going on overseas postings alone allowed her to trade an unhappy home life for a new, globe-trotting career.\n\nHer initial job, at the Office of Russian Affairs, led to assignments in Moscow and Uzbekistan. Ms. McCutcheon was scheduled to return to Moscow, but the plan soon unraveled. She had filed for divorce, and her wife had referred in court filings to her gender distress and dressing in women’s clothing.\n\nWhen that information reached officials at the State Department, they questioned Ms. McCutcheon about her personal life, probing for details that could make her vulnerable to blackmail in Russia. Her assignment was rescinded on unspecified security grounds.\n\nWith her diplomatic career in peril, Ms. McCutcheon managed to get an unglamorous posting at the embassy in Romania working in information technology.\n\nSoon after arriving in Bucharest in the fall of 2010, Ms. McCutcheon confided in the nurse at the embassy clinic about her gender struggles. After hearing her story, the nurse leaned in and gave Ms. McCutcheon a hug, urging her to reach out to the State Department’s L.G.B.T.Q. employee group, glifaa.\n\nMs. McCutcheon feared she had committed professional suicide by confiding in a colleague. There was little precedent in the federal work force for what she had just done.\n\nA relevant case was that of Diane Schroer, a retired Army Special Forces officer who was offered a job as a terrorism analyst at the Library of Congress in 2004, only to have it rescinded after she disclosed her intention to transition. Four years later, a federal judge ruled in favor of Ms. Schroer — but his narrow order did not create broad protections for transgender workers.\n\nAs Ms. McCutcheon perused glifaa’s website, though, she was startled to learn that months earlier Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, had added gender identity to the department’s nondiscrimination policy as part of a broader initiative to champion L.G.B.T.Q. rights abroad.\n\n“Oh my God,” Ms. McCutcheon recalled thinking. “My career may survive.”\n\nAmong her first moves was calling the embassy’s human resources officer, Natalie Koza. When Ms. McCutcheon said she was wearing women’s clothing on the weekends and planned to come out at work, Ms. Koza, who was at home, uncorked a bottle of wine to steady her nerves.\n\n“Nobody in the department had ever done this,” Ms. Koza said in an interview. “Yet there was such happiness on her part and also determination.”\n\nDays later, a senior embassy official spotted Ms. McCutcheon on the street wearing a dress, Ms. Koza said. The official demanded that Ms. McCutcheon meet with a State Department psychiatrist and suggested that it would be best if she left Bucharest.\n\nAfter the psychiatrist reported that Ms. McCutcheon had appeared to be of sound mind, Ms. McCutcheon emailed Duane Butcher, a colleague from a previous assignment who would soon arrive in Bucharest as the embassy’s second in command. She asked for his support.\n\nMr. Butcher was surprised: He had never suspected what Ms. McCutcheon was going through.\n\nHe agreed to help. He considered her a standout diplomat with a rare set of skills: science expertise, mastery of Russian and a knack for forging deep friendships with locals. And the new nondiscrimination policy was clear.\n\nAfter arriving in Bucharest, Mr. Butcher quietly established a team that came to be known as the Gender Transition Committee. Its members tackled practical matters — like how to change Ms. McCutcheon’s name in the computer system — and debated how to handle resistance within the embassy along with possible public fallout.\n\nTheir work became public in November of 2011 with a brief letter Ms. McCutcheon wrote in the embassy’s newsletter titled “Farewell Robert, Welcome Robyn!” It included before-and-after headshots and tongue-in-cheek answers to questions she expected colleagues to have. (“No, my sense of humor has not changed,” she wrote. “It’s still impenetrably based on engineering and science.”)\n\nTwo days later, heads snapped as Ms. McCutcheon walked into the embassy’s Marine Ball wearing a royal blue gown. To make a splash, she had colored her hair a dull red, put on sparkly earrings and purchased new shoes with heels. She walked in confidently past a coterie of Marines, one of whom handed her a rose.\n\nIn the past, she had been deemed a security threat and told to get mental help, and had lost out on a choice assignment. Now everyone wanted to hug her, Mr. Butcher recalled, even colleagues he knew were politically conservative.\n\n“It was a transcendent moment,” he said.\n\nIn 2012, Ms. McCutcheon flew to Thailand for gender confirmation and facial feminization surgeries, paying the $35,000 cost out of pocket. The years that followed were the most fulfilling of her career. The State Department gave Ms. McCutcheon awards for her activism in countries with budding L.G.B.T.Q. movements.\n\nHer apartments in Romania, and later in Kazakhstan, became gathering points for activists. Ms. McCutcheon was elected president of glifaa, a role she used to advocate for broader protections for gay and transgender federal workers.\n\n“I had never imagined that, even in a democratic society like the U.S., a transgender woman could serve in such a visible role,” said Viktoria Primak, a transgender activist from Kazakhstan.\n\nWhile Ms. McCutcheon was best known for her L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy, she also wrote cables about health policy and human rights and rallied governments to sign on to the Paris Agreement, the pact among most nations to fight climate change. She spent 2013 in Washington working on nuclear arms control policy.\n\nAround that time, the government was taking steps to broaden protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people, culminating in a 2014 decision by the Justice Department to reverse its longstanding position that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not extend to transgender people.\n\nMs. McCutcheon’s story loomed large as these changes were debated and drafted, said Sharon McGowan, who served in senior roles at the Department of Justice and at the Office of Personnel Management from 2010 to 2017.\n\n“It’s hard to overstate how important Robyn is and will continue to be in the story of this country’s march toward progress,” Ms. McGowan said.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, as Ms. McCutcheon’s time as glifaa president was ending, John Kerry, then the secretary of state, attended a Pride event in the Ben Franklin dining room at the State Department. He acknowledged the “prejudice” and “completely inappropriate judgments” Ms. McCutcheon had at times endured at the State Department. “She didn’t just get through a difficult period,” Mr. Kerry said at the gathering. “She was determined to turn it into a precedent-setting event.”\n\nThe moment felt unreal, Ms. McCutcheon said, coming just years after her career nearly ended in disgrace. “I felt like I was living a miracle,” she said.\n\nMs. McCutcheon left the State Department in 2019, having reached the mandatory retirement age, and headed to Maine, where she had spent years building a cabin with a wood-burning stove and walls decorated with old Soviet propaganda posters. She wrote a memoir and spent months on cross-country bike rides.\n\nThe transgender movement faced setbacks during Mr. Trump’s first term as he rescinded many Obama-era policies. After President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected in 2020, Republicans turned up the pressure, leaning into fights over transgender athletes in school sports and transition care for teenagers.\n\nIn retrospect, she said, some transgender advocates may have erred in asserting that children who experienced gender distress should be allowed to transition without rigorously establishing that they were, in fact, transgender.\n\n“Was there a period here of, Rah, rah, rah, yes, we will celebrate you, we will just promote you on your path?” she pondered. “Maybe that was too much, too fast.”\n\nMs. McCutcheon followed last year’s presidential contest with trepidation. Last fall, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that schools were helping children undergo gender surgeries without parental consent. His most aired television ad in the final weeks of the campaign proclaimed: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\nShe held out hope that Kamala Harris would win and continue to address other issues she was passionate about, including climate change, vaccine development and human rights.\n\nLast year, at the suggestion of a friend, Ms. McCutcheon applied for permanent residency in Kazakhstan, the country where she last served and where she had dear friends. She didn’t have a firm plan to leave the United States, but she wanted to have the option.\n\nMr. Trump’s re-election plunged her into despair. For the third time in her life — the first since her transition — she was taking antidepressants. After Mr. Trump took office, the question for Ms. McCutcheon became when, not whether, to leave the United States.\n\nMs. McCutcheon was aghast at the executive order the president signed on his first day in office, declaring that “it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.” The order went on to say, “These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”\n\nThen came policies barring transgender workers from using public restrooms that matched their gender identities, which left several friends feeling their jobs were untenable. Mr. Trump’s new passport policy prohibited the State Department from issuing passports with a gender marker that differed from a person’s sex assigned at birth. Ms. McCutcheon saw that as dangerous for transgender people traveling overseas.\n\nThe rollback of rights was so sudden and far-reaching it left longtime advocates like Ms. McCutcheon feeling stunned and paralyzed. After retiring, she had assumed a new generation of activists would build on the progress hers had made. But suddenly, leaving — even at the cost of being away from her son, Matthew, and her boyfriend, John Quinn — felt like the only way to preserve her sanity.\n\n“I tumbled into a very dark spot very quickly because it seemed so unexpected to me that this could happen so fast,” Ms. McCutcheon said.\n\nShe purchased a two-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of Astana and planned her move for mid-June. Ms. McCutcheon marched in the Washington Pride parade early that month, holding a glifaa banner alongside fellow State Department retirees.\n\nShe went on a few trips with Mr. Quinn to say farewell to friends. And she attended the wedding of her son, where Ms. McCutcheon delivered a toast about the enduring power of love — even in a complicated family story.\n\nLate on a Wednesday morning, an orange moving truck lumbered down the dirt road leading to Ms. McCutcheon’s cabin. She remained stoic as movers carried out her beloved road bike and 14 tidily packed boxes containing clothes, books and kitchenware.\n\nA couple of days later, a friend came by to drive her to the bus station, the first leg of a journey that would end more than 2,500 miles away. Ms. McCutcheon sat momentarily on her suitcase, partaking in a Russian tradition that calls for a moment of reflection.\n\nThe pine tree forest that surrounded the cabin was dulled by a slight mist. It was 8 a.m., a tranquil time before the black flies would start biting.\n\n“I’ve left before, I’ve gone off on long trips before, but I always knew I’d be coming back,” she recalled thinking as the car pulled away. “This is the first time there’s a chance I won’t.”\n\nRead by Ernesto Londoño\n\nAudio produced by Patricia Sulbarán.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/nyregion/blind-immigrant-ice-detention-judge-orders-release.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:08:18-05:00","title":"ICE Frees Blind Migrant Who Was Detained for Days in Isolation","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A blind Ecuadorean man, Carlos Anibal Chalco Chango, was arrested in Queens, New York, on November 4, 2025, during a routine interaction with ICE agents who sought to detain his 20-year-old son.

It was a surprising move by an agency that rarely releases detainees under President Trump.\n\nThe two-week effort by his lawyers to free him came amid pitched legal battles playing out across the United States, as lawyers file emergency motions to have ICE release migrants who are being subjected to mandatory detention.\n\nUnlike Mr. Chalco Chango, many of the more than 60,000 immigrants in detention don’t have lawyers. Most are forced to fight deportation alone, leaving many to consider the Trump administration’s offers to leave the country voluntarily to avoid months in jail.\n\nWhat distinguished the Ecuadorean man’s case was his disability.\n\nICE agents arrested Mr. Chalco Chango on Nov. 4 as he was leaving his home in Corona, Queens, an immigrant-rich neighborhood where advocates and local officials have documented an increase in arrests of mostly Hispanic men this month.\n\nThe federal immigration agents were seeking to arrest Mr. Chalco Chango’s 20-year-old son, and they approached the older man to show him a picture of their “intended target” on a cellphone, according to government filings.\n\nMr. Chalco Chango told them that he was blind and could not see the image, according to his lawyers, who said the agents pushed him against a wall, handcuffed him and put him inside a car. An agent told him in Spanish to call his son and tell him to turn himself in, his lawyers said. Then, the agent said, Mr. Chalco Chango would be free to go.\n\nBut when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too. Both men were whisked away to 26 Federal Plaza, the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, setting off the legal saga to release him.\n\nThe federal government said in filings that the agents had “engaged in a consensual conversation” with Mr. Chalco Chango, who they said “freely admitted to the officers” that he had no legal status.\n\nMr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023. Border Patrol agents who encountered them released them to seek asylum, according to filings.\n\nAfter his Nov. 4 arrest, Mr. Chalco Chango was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, where he was barred from having his cane or using a text-to-audio phone app that could help him read legal documents.\n\nAfter a judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. of Manhattan federal court, ruled that Mr. Chalco Chango could not be removed from the country, ICE moved him on Nov. 8 to the Orange County jail.\n\nThere, officials said they had “serious concerns” about safely accommodating him in the jail’s general population because of his blindness, according to a court filing by the office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn a letter on Monday informing Judge Carter of Mr. Chalco Chango’s release, the government said it considered the case moot, a suggestion that no further proceedings over his detention were necessary. The judge directed the parties to send him a joint letter by Thursday addressing whether they agreed that the case was moot, though Mr. Chalco Chango’s separate immigration case still appears unresolved.\n\nPaige Austin and Harold A. Solis, lawyers at Make the Road New York, an advocacy group representing Mr. Chalco Chango, said in an interview on Tuesday that they wanted assurances from ICE that their client would not be detained in the future.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.\n\nHe thought his cell might have a clock, he said, but he could not see it. He could, however, detect when people were outside the cell by the shadows they cast.\n\nSo when he saw shadows, he added, “I try to ask through the door — what time is it?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/nyregion/border-czar-more-immigrant-arrests-nyc.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"18:42:19-05:00","title":"Trump’s Border Czar Threatens More Immigrant Arrests in New York City","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump’s top border adviser, Thomas Homan, has threatened to significantly ramp up immigrant detentions in New York City, citing the city’s sanctuary policies enacted under former Mayor Bill de Blasio as a reason for federal intervention. This announcement follows the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor, a Democrat and democratic socialist who has openly opposed Trump’s immigration agenda. Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously blamed sanctuary laws for a shooting incident involving an off-duty customs officer, reinforcing the narrative of public safety risks. Federal enforcement has already expanded to include arrests in immigrant-heavy areas like Long Island and the Hudson Valley, and a recent operation arrested 37 undocumented truck drivers on Interstate 90 near Buffalo.

We’re going to flood the zone.”\n\nThe city’s sanctuary laws, most of which were passed in 2014 when Bill de Blasio was mayor, strictly limit communication and cooperation between the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and city departments.\n\nMr. Homan’s warning came as New York’s leaders have been preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump will deploy the National Guard or more immigration agents to New York after Mr. Mamdani’s victory on Nov. 4.\n\nMr. Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, ran for mayor arguing that only he could stand up to Mr. Trump, whom he described as a threat to democracy. Mr. Trump has belittled Mr. Mamdani for months, calling him a danger to New York. (Mr. Mamdani reached out to the White House recently to set up a meeting with the president.)\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, who met with Mr. Mamdani last week to discuss Mr. Trump’s threats, said on Monday that state officials had been conducting exercises ahead of a potential federal deployment, adding that the city’s business leaders, some of whom have ties to Mr. Trump, would have a “very important” role to play.\n\n“I’ve had conversations with a lot of business leaders and saying, ‘When the time comes, make sure that you also convey your concerns about what this would do to destabilize New York City and the outsize impact that this would have across America,’” she said in Albany on Monday.\n\nNew York officials have held phone calls with their counterparts in Chicago and Los Angeles to learn from their experiences confronting a surge in federal agents. Those discussions have focused, in part, on ensuring that any protests remain peaceful, to avoid the scenes of violence that could give Mr. Trump a pretext for deploying troops.\n\n“They highlighted how important it is to get ahead of the narrative,” said Ana María Archila, a co-director of the progressive Working Families Party, who has participated in some of the calls. “Trump is looking for a fight. He wants the images of the fight in the streets.”\n\nSince the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown started, much of the enforcement in New York City has taken place at federal immigration courts. But agents have also arrested people in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and towns across the state, including on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley.\n\nThis month, Border Patrol agents conducted an operation targeting commercial truck drivers on Interstate 90 near Buffalo. They arrested 37 men who they said were undocumented and had been issued commercial driver’s licenses, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe federal government buttressed its deportation campaign with an infusion of billions of dollars for immigration enforcement efforts as part of Mr. Trump’s domestic policy law. Shortly after it passed in July, Mr. Homan visited New York City with Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, to blame Mayor Eric Adams and the city’s sanctuary laws for the shooting of an off-duty customs officer in Manhattan during an attempted robbery.\n\nAs New York City officials prepared for the potential arrival of the National Guard, county clerks in other parts of the state expressed dismay that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had abruptly canceled naturalization ceremonies, probably complicating the process for some immigrants.\n\nAt least seven counties were affected, said Timothy C. Idoni, the Westchester County clerk. The clerk’s office there has held such ceremonies for more than 40 years. On Friday, Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican whose district includes parts of Westchester, wrote a letter to Joseph B. Edlow, the director of the citizenship agency, seeking to reverse the decision.\n\nMatthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the agency, said that the county courts did not meet federal requirements to conduct naturalization ceremonies. Applicants scheduled to take part in ceremonies would receive new appointments, and their naturalization processes would continue, Mr. Tragesser said.\n\nMr. Idoni said that applicants would now probably have to travel to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan to complete the final citizenship requirements and to receive naturalization certificates instead of participating in celebratory events arranged by their communities. The building in Manhattan has offices for the citizenship agency as well as for ICE, and it has become the epicenter of immigration arrests in the city.\n\n“Heaven knows what they face down there, with all the things that are going on with immigration issues,” Mr. Idoni said. “We’re all very upset.”\n\nGrace Ashford contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/texas-map-ruling-redistricting.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:03:44-05:00","title":"Federal Court Blocks Texas’ Republican-Friendly Congressional Map","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal court in El Paso has blocked Texas’s 2025 Republican-friendly congressional redistricting map from taking effect in the 2026 midterm elections, finding substantial evidence that the map racially gerrymandered districts.

Greg Abbott of Texas, who directed state legislators to redraw the congressional map this summer, quickly said the state would appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state filed its notice of appeal later on Tuesday.\n\nIf Texas files an emergency application, asking the court to clear the way for the map, it would be likely to go first to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., one of the court’s conservatives, because he is the justice assigned to handle emergency matters from that region of the country. He is also likely to be the justice who sets a briefing schedule for the case and who could issue a brief pause, called an “administrative stay,” meant to give the full court time to consider the case.\n\nIn the Texas court’s 160-page opinion written by Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2019, the judges found that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” The court cited a July letter from the Justice Department to Texas lawmakers, focused on the racial makeup of districts, in which federal prosecutors said the state’s 2021 map was unconstitutional because it included districts where no ethnic group had an outright majority. The court said that was a “legally incorrect assertion.”\n\nJudge Brown was joined by Judge David C. Guaderrama, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. Judge Jerry Smith, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, opposed the decision.\n\nCivil rights leaders who brought the suit celebrated the decision on Tuesday.\n\n“This is a victory for the voters of Texas and for the fight to preserve democracy nationwide,” said Derrick Johnson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., which brought the suit along with several other groups, including the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nMr. Abbott criticized the decision, saying in a statement that “the Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans’ conservative voting preferences — and for no other reason.” He said that any claim that the map was racially discriminatory was “absurd and unsupported by the testimony” that the court heard over 10 days of hearings.\n\nWhile the ultimate legal outcome is uncertain, the court’s decision was the latest setback to Mr. Trump’s attempt to tilt more states’ congressional maps in Republicans’ favor before the 2026 midterms. Last week, Republicans in Indiana announced that they would not be taking up the president’s request to redraw the state’s map, drawing blowback from Mr. Trump on social media over the weekend.\n\nAt the outset of this year’s sudden and unusual push to redraw congressional maps in the middle of the decade, it appeared that Mr. Trump and Republicans had the upper hand, with their party in control of the mapmaking process in more states.\n\nBut since Texas passed its map in August, Democrats have countered with a gerrymander of their own in California, with Virginia and potentially other states set to follow. When Gov. Gavin Newsom of California introduced his state’s redistricting plan, he said it would take effect only if Texas also gerrymandered its congressional maps. But that provision was removed from the measure three days before lawmakers took final votes on it.\n\nSo should the federal court decision in Texas hold, Democrats could find themselves ahead in the redistricting battle. (Republicans have also sued to challenge the new California map, adding even more uncertainty to the national picture.)\n\n“Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned — and democracy won,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “This ruling is a win for Texas, and for every American who fights for free and fair elections.”\n\nA major wild card in the national fight over maps is the fate of the Voting Rights Act, which faces a critical test at the Supreme Court this term. The justices appeared skeptical in October of upholding a key provision of the law. If the court strikes down that provision, which allows lawmakers to consider race when drawing districts, Republicans in states across the South would be able to tear up their maps and wipe out a series of seats held by Democrats of color.\n\nAt the same time, the Texas court decision signals that litigation could still be a bulwark against both parties’ efforts to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms. Courts have long been the venue for civil rights groups and political parties to challenge the validity of maps, and nearly every newly passed congressional map this year is already facing legal challenges.\n\nKen Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said in a statement that “the Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal,” using Mr. Trump’s nickname for the Texas redistricting. Mr. Paxton said he expected the Supreme Court “to uphold Texas’s sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”\n\nThe legal battle is taking place against a fast-moving political clock in Texas. The deadline for candidates to file to run next year is early next month, and the primary elections are scheduled for March.\n\nThe Republican push to redistrict in Texas began this year at the urging of the White House, as early as February and March, according to the court.\n\nMr. Abbott called a special session over the summer, summoning back legislators to redraw the map in an attempt to pick up as many as five seats currently held by Democrats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state’s 38 seats in the U.S. House.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of the State Legislature and moved swiftly to enact a new map that took aim at urban districts in and around Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, as well as along the border with Mexico.\n\nDemocrats in the State House temporarily halted the process by fleeing the state and denying Republicans a legislative quorum necessary to adopt the map. The move, while ultimately unsuccessful in fully blocking the map, drew national attention to the aggressive redistricting in Texas. It spurred Democrats in California to embark on their own aggressive redrawing of the state’s congressional map to counteract the possible Republican gains in Texas.\n\n“Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans’ voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing,” State Representative Gene Wu of Houston, who led the Democratic walkout, said after the decision on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the legislative hearings over the summer, Republican lawmakers repeatedly stressed that they were redrawing the congressional lines for partisan purposes, to advantage Republicans, and not based on race. Such a distinction is critical after the Supreme Court effectively blessed partisan gerrymandering in a 2019 ruling.\n\n“Partisanship, political performance, pro-Republican is fine. It’s legal,” said State Representative Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the legislation and defended the map during a final floor debate in the Texas House in August.\n\nBut in its opinion, the court cited statements that Mr. Abbott and legislative leaders had made that suggested they had drawn their map to alleviate the Justice Department’s concerns about the racial makeup of districts — and not for purely partisan reasons.\n\n“For these and other reasons, the Plaintiff Groups are likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,” the court wrote.\n\nLaurel Rosenhall and Abbie VanSickle contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/elon-musk-politics-trump-doge.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"15:52:54-05:00","title":"Musk Is Back in Politics.

Does He Want to Stay a While?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T15:52:54-05:00\n\nLess than six months after a blowup with President Trump caused Elon Musk to dramatically leave Washington, allies of the world’s richest person are planning a big party to celebrate what the two men did together.\n\nThis weekend in Austin, dozens of people who worked for Mr. Musk under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency will converge for a reunion gathering, according to three people with direct knowledge of the event who, like others in this article, insisted on anonymity to discuss Mr. Musk’s relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Musk himself is expected to attend the event, according to one of the people, though his plans could yet change. The festivities will be at a high-end hotel where Mr. Musk often holes up in a suite.\n\nThe two-day reunion, organized by DOGE leaders, will feature two dinners and may include tours of factories for Mr. Musk’s companies SpaceX, Tesla and the Boring Company, according to planning materials.\n\nThis week is a return to the political arena for Mr. Musk, who in September dismissed his time as Mr. Trump’s right-hand man in government as “a hell of a side quest.” On Tuesday evening, he is also scheduled to make his first public appearance in Washington since he left the capital in May, appearing at a formal dinner that Mr. Trump is throwing for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, according to a White House official briefed on the plans.\n\nIn the period since he left Washington in a rage — casting aspersions on Mr. Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein and floating the creation of a third party — Mr. Musk has largely backed down from his feud with the president. The tech billionaire has retreated from his third-party idea, seen a key ally renominated for a top administration role, and reached something of an unsteady truce with Mr. Trump, people on both sides of the dispute said.\n\n“He had a bad moment,” Mr. Trump said on Air Force One late last month. “It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid,” he added. “I like Elon and suspect I will always like him.”\n\nMr. Musk, who spent almost $300 million to elect Mr. Trump last year, is likely to make some contributions to support Republican candidates in the 2026 midterm elections, two people briefed on his thinking said. Last week, he made his first midterm endorsement — of Representative Byron Donalds, Republican of Florida — and he retains two Trump-aligned campaign consultants on his staff.\n\nBut he has not been closely following Republican politics since leaving Washington and is largely thinking about company matters these days, three people close to him said.\n\nAfter Mr. Musk exited Washington — upset about the administration’s domestic policy bill and humiliated by the withdrawn nomination of a top ally, Jared Isaacman, to lead NASA — he promised that he would start a third party to challenge Republicans. It would be called the America Party, he said, and on July 5, he told his more than 200 million followers that the America Party had been “formed.”\n\nIn truth, Mr. Musk then made no moves to do so.\n\nEven in the immediate aftermath of his angry pronouncements, Mr. Musk’s friends detected in private conversations with him that he was not particularly aware of how expensive and complicated it would be to create a viable third party, according to four people who spoke with him at the time.\n\nSome of Mr. Musk’s political advisers, who are more familiar with the ins and outs of Republican affairs, were skittish about moving forward with a third party. Doing so would endanger their own professional prospects in Mr. Trump’s party, people close to the advisers said. Behind the scenes, some of them made clear to fellow Washington insiders that Mr. Musk was not following through and was just blowing off steam.\n\nJamie LaBranche, a little-known candidate for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, sent a letter to Mr. Musk’s advisers in July, encouraging them to start the party so he could run on its line. “Elon Musk, we have work to do,” he wrote. “Please help me help the America Party.”\n\nA few weeks later, in mid-August, he heard from a lawyer who claimed to represent Mr. Musk, who told him there would be no third-party effort, Mr. LaBranche recounted.\n\nMr. Musk has still said nothing in public to confirm that he will not pursue the third-party effort. His discussion of the idea in his social media posts — which he is sometimes prone to quietly delete — remains online.\n\nSeptember appeared to be a turning point in Mr. Musk’s relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Musk said then that he had been invited to a high-profile dinner with tech executives that was hosted by Mr. Trump. He sent one of his top aides, John Hering, in his place.\n\nMr. Musk then approached Mr. Trump at the memorial service for Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was assassinated. They held an animated conversation for several minutes that was captured on television, and Mr. Musk, who friends say was emotionally affected by Mr. Kirk’s death, posted a picture online of the exchange.\n\nA few days later, Mr. Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, said it had struck a deal with Mr. Trump’s administration that would allow federal agencies to use its chatbot for a nominal fee. Mr. Musk praised the administration in a statement.\n\nIn the weeks since Mr. Kirk’s memorial, Mr. Trump has spoken with Mr. Musk “on and off, a little bit,” he told reporters late last month.\n\nFour officials who work at the White House or for Mr. Trump’s political operation said Mr. Musk’s name rarely comes up these days. But some recent personnel moves could not have been scripted any better by Mr. Musk.\n\nSergio Gor, a senior White House aide whom Mr. Musk steamed about to friends this summer for forcing out Mr. Isaacman, was recently confirmed as ambassador to India. At his Oval Office send-off last week, Mr. Trump seemed to gesture at the tensions with Mr. Musk. “Some people don’t like him so much — I’ll be honest with you, Sergio,” he said.\n\nMr. Musk has also clashed for months with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is also the acting administrator of NASA. “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X last month.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Trump again nominated Mr. Isaacman to oversee the space program, in a move that could hand significant government influence to his close friend, Mr. Musk. The billionaire celebrated the pick this month.\n\nOne top Trump ally has been important in the reconciliation: Mr. Musk remains fond of Vice President JD Vance, according to two people who have spoken to him.\n\n“VP Vance has great taste,” Mr. Musk wrote on X last week after the vice president praised Grok, the A.I. chatbot developed by xAI. Mr. Vance is considered a top contender to be the 2028 Republican presidential nominee, and his allies are already eyeing Mr. Musk’s potential support in a primary race.\n\nMr. Vance and Mr. Musk have continued to talk occasionally, according to two people with knowledge of their conversations, even as the billionaire’s relationship with the rest of the administration deteriorated.\n\nKatie Rogers and Christopher Flavelle contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-tennessee-house-election.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:19:37-05:00","title":"Kamala Harris Hits Campaign Trail in Tennessee Special Election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise campaign appearance in Tennessee to support Democrat Aftyn Behn in a closely contested special election for the open Seventh Congressional District, which was created by the resignation of Republican Representative Mark Green.

closely watched Tennessee special election for Congress, marking the first time since she left office that she has returned to the campaign trail for another candidate.\n\nThe race for the open House seat is in a district that President Trump won by more than 20 percentage points last year, and is seen as a long shot for Democrats. But Ms. Harris’s decision to campaign is the latest sign that the Dec. 2 election is being seriously contested. National party leaders now see the contest as an important test of the political environment before next year’s midterm elections.\n\nEarly voting has already begun in the race between State Representative Aftyn Behn, the Democrat, and Matt Van Epps, a veteran and the Republican nominee. Mr. Van Epps recently received some help from Mr. Trump in the form of a virtual rally.\n\nMs. Harris headlined a canvassing kickoff event at a local park for Ms. Behn on Tuesday afternoon after making an appearance on the campus of Fisk University, a historically Black college that is in the contested district.\n\n“Why am I in Tennessee? Because I know the power is in the South,” Ms. Harris said into a bullhorn at Hadley Park in Nashville. She did not mention Ms. Behn by name but urged the crowd to get out the vote in two weeks.\n\n“This election is 14 days from today!” she said. Several of the students, phone cameras held high, were not registered to vote in the district, but said they appreciated Ms. Harris drawing attention to their campuses and the state of Tennessee politics.\n\nMs. Behn spoke before Ms. Harris’s arrival, telling the crowd the election was “the most competitive race in America.”\n\nMs. Harris was already scheduled to be in Nashville this week for her book tour for her election memoir, “107 Days,” and adding the campaign event is a sign of her growing engagement in national politics a year after her defeat. She had considered running for governor of California but ultimately decided against a candidacy, and she has left open the door to running for president again.\n\nBefore this month’s election in California, Ms. Harris also attended a rally for Proposition 50, a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map to add as many as five new Democratic seats.

2025-11-18T14:14:45-05:00\n\nThe Trump administration’s strategy of using federal agents and troops to enforce immigration laws and what it says is a bid to reduce crime in U.S. cities has extended to North Carolina. Border Patrol agents made scores of arrests in Charlotte over the weekend and then moved into the Raleigh area on Tuesday.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been heavily involved in many of the cities. National Guard troops have been called in to help in a few of them. In other cities, the federal intervention has involved agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nHere is how federal forces have been used in cities:\n\nThe federal operation in Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina and one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, began on Saturday, and it was uncertain how long it would last. The city’s booming Latin American population, which has helped fuel the city’s growth as a Southern business hub, drew the attention of the Trump administration, whose focus has been on Democratic-led cities with large immigrant communities.\n\nBorder Patrol agents made more than 130 arrests in the city over the weekend. The agents are led by Gregory Bovino, a senior official in the agency who is from western North Carolina and who has directed similar operations in Chicago and Los Angeles this year.\n\nThe use of the Border Patrol, an arm of Customs and Border Protection that has focused primarily on the nation’s southern border in recent years, is an example of how the Trump administration has expanded the scope of some of its agencies. In the past, the Border Patrol has operated mostly near a land or maritime border, whereas ICE typically operates inside the United States. (The Border Patrol and ICE are each part of the Department of Homeland Security.)\n\nBut the Border Patrol’s stated mission is to detect and prevent the illegal entry of people into the United States, so it can make arrests anywhere in the nation, though some of its powers — like the ability to stop and search people — are more limited outside a zone of 100 miles near a border.\n\nBorder Patrol agents expanded their operations in North Carolina on Tuesday by deploying agents to the state’s heavily Democratic Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. The full scope of the operation was not immediately clear. But North Carolina is the first state to be targeted that is considered a political battleground state.\n\nThe federal crackdown on illegal immigration that began in the Chicago area in early September goes on, though it has been tamped down somewhat by the courts. Before he departed, Mr. Bovino and federal agents that included Border Patrol personnel had in recent weeks taken some of the most aggressive actions yet.\n\nA federal judge condemned agents for using unnecessary force that included using tear gas and pepper spray against Chicago residents without giving them proper warning, and for pointing guns at civilians who were not a physical threat. The judge also said Mr. Bovino had lied to her about his tactics. The Justice Department argued that the tactics were justified because some protesters had become violent.\n\nPresident Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts. Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.\n\nOverall, the federal operation in the region has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests. But the sweeps have rounded up American citizens and legal residents, too.\n\nMemphis is the only Democratic-led city in a state with a Republican governor that has seen federal forces move in. On Monday night, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the National Guard from participating in federal actions in the operation, which Mr. Trump and state officials have said has focused on combating serious crime. (The state is expected to appeal the ruling before the pause takes effect.)\n\nBut the use of the Guard was just one part of a broad federal task force, which is otherwise unaffected by the ruling. More than a dozen agencies have taken part since it began in late September, including the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in more than 2,600 arrests. Some of those arrested have been undocumented immigrants, and residents have reported seeing immigration agents throughout the city.\n\nGov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has welcomed the federal effort and agreed to deploy the Guard. But many local Democratic officials in Memphis, while acknowledging that crime has been a longstanding issue, have said that serious crime was already on the decline and that using the Guard was unnecessary. Still, many have made a point of working with the extra federal resources.\n\nProtests in Memphis have been far more muted than in other cities in part because many groups have focused their efforts more on informing residents, hoping to lower the number of arrests or stops by federal agents.\n\nNowhere has the presence of federal forces been more apparent than in Los Angeles, home to the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants. Raids across Southern California in June led to huge protests that prompted President Trump to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city. Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw that operation, left the Los Angeles area in September to lead operations in Chicago and then Charlotte. But federal agents have remained in the area and continue to conduct immigration sweeps.\n\nCounty and city officials have said that they have received almost-daily reports from residents of immigration sweeps from South Los Angeles to the Inland Empire region east of the city. Since June, federal agents have made nearly 9,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Local leaders have said that the arrests and continued presence of federal immigration agents in the area have instilled fear among immigrant communities.\n\nThe Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement in the city around June, and a small but persistent group of protesters has held daily demonstrations outside Portland’s ICE building ever since. Skirmishes with the authorities led to the closing of that building for more than three weeks at one point, according to the Department of Homeland Security, but protests had largely fizzled by September. Late that month, however, Mr. Trump tried to send National Guard troops to the city, saying that the ICE building and federal workers there needed to be protected from “war-ravaged Portland.”\n\nPortland and Oregon sued, and a federal judge this month issued a permanent block on the deployment. The administration is appealing. Over the weekend, the Pentagon said that it was going to send home about 200 California National Guard troops who had been sent to Portland but never deployed on the streets. About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.\n\nProtests at the ICE facility have generally been peaceful and small — usually fewer than a dozen people. But a few confrontations have turned violent, with federal officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper-spray balls.\n\nMr. Trump began a takeover of the nation’s capital in August after claiming that crime had gotten out of control (though data suggested crime has dropped in the district). At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.\n\nThey have also been directed to help efforts to beautify the city, and they have spent parts of the last few months picking up leaves and depositing mulch at parks. The troops are expected to remain well into 2026. The District of Columbia has sued, arguing that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority by ordering in the troops without the consent of Mayor Muriel Bowser, and by using those troops to conduct law enforcement. The judge has not yet ruled on the case.\n\nBut Ms. Bowser has welcomed assistance from other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who have coordinated with the D.C. police to get guns and drugs off the street. The Department of Justice said last week that in the 100 days since the federal takeover,  more than two dozen federal and local agencies had made more than 6,000 arrests and seized more than 600 illegal guns.\n\nReporting was contributed by Eduardo Medina, Emily Cochrane, Julie Bosman, Mitch Smith, Jesus Jiménez, Anna Griffin, Campbell Robertson, Hamed Aleaziz and Eric Schmitt.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/technology/meta-google-antitrust-tech.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"19:53:29-05:00","title":"Technology Is Fast and the Courts Are Slow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses how major tech companies, particularly Meta, Google, and Amazon, are successfully arguing that the rapid pace of technological innovation — including the rise of TikTok, YouTube, and artificial intelligence — renders traditional antitrust claims outdated.

The judge’s opinion cited the rise of apps like TikTok and YouTube as evidence that Meta did not have a monopoly in social media.\n\n“The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” wrote Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nTo blunt government efforts to rein in the most powerful tech companies, Silicon Valley has increasingly pointed to rapid technological advances. The companies have cited changes, from the ascent of new social media platforms to the explosion of artificial intelligence, to make the case that government regulation is unnecessary or even perilous.\n\nGoogle convinced a federal judge this year that only modest changes to its business were needed to fix its monopoly in search, after it argued that the tech landscape had changed because of A.I. competition. The company also invoked the new technology in a separate hearing on how to fix its dominance in advertising technology. One of its witnesses testified that forcing Google to spin off pieces of its business would harm small publishers already reeling from the impact of A.I.\n\nShifts in the tech industry make it harder to win antitrust cases that can drag out for years, legal and industry experts said.\n\n“It’s another encouraging sign for the tech companies,” said Davie Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has written on digital competition. “The tough talk on antitrust is looking less and less tough.”\n\nJennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, said in a statement that the ruling “recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.” A spokesman for the F.T.C., Joe Simonson, said the agency was “deeply disappointed in this decision.”\n\nThe industry’s arguments threaten a five-year campaign by the United States, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, to limit the biggest tech companies through a series of slow-moving antitrust lawsuits.\n\nA 2023 lawsuit against Amazon, in which the government accused the company of squeezing the small merchants using its platform, is not scheduled for trial until 2027. The government also sued Apple last year, accusing it of making it difficult for users to leave its ecosystem of devices. A trial date has not been set.\n\nLast year, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google had broken the law to maintain a monopoly in search. A.I. played little role in the 2023 trial that resulted in Judge Mehta’s ruling. But Google spent most of a three-week hearing to determine how to fix the monopoly arguing that A.I. chatbots have upended the way people search for information online.\n\nJudge Mehta agreed. In September, he ruled that A.I. had “changed the course of this case.” He ordered Google to share some data with its competitors but did not force the company to sell its popular Chrome web browser or take other, more drastic measures.\n\nIn April, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Google had illegally dominated various tools used to place advertisements on pages around the web.\n\nAt a hearing this fall to determine how to fix the issue, Google called as a witness the chief executive of wikiHow, a small website featuring how-to guides. Traffic to the site had dropped as internet users turned to A.I. products for answers, said the executive, Elizabeth Douglas. The site would suffer further if the court forced Google to spin off its advertising tools, she added.\n\nClosing arguments in that hearing are scheduled for this week.\n\nChanges in the technology industry echoed throughout the Meta case, too, according to Judge Boasberg’s 89-page ruling on Tuesday.\n\nThe government had argued that Meta had a monopoly in “personal social-networking” and identified the company’s main competitor as Snap, the parent company of the Snapchat video app. But Meta’s lawyers contended that the company faced additional competition from social media companies like TikTok and YouTube.\n\nJudge Boasberg noted that he had considered the case multiple times, including when Meta filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit and when both sides asked for the case to be resolved with a summary judgment.\n\nEach time, Meta’s apps “had changed,” Judge Boasberg wrote. “The competitors had, too.\"\n\nThe rulings are a victory for the tech industry as it stares down years of future litigation, legal experts said.\n\nThe traditional hallmarks of monopoly markets include low rates of innovation, unchanging market shares and unchecked pricing power, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School.\n\n“Big tech does not fit any of those criteria,” Mr. Hovenkamp said. “These are fast-moving, dynamic markets.”\n\nThe argument that technology races ahead while courts lag behind has been a familiar theme for decades.\n\nAn antitrust case against IBM was settled after 13 years, in 1982, just as the personal computer revolution was taking off, undermining the importance of IBM’s dominance of mainframe computing. And by the time an antitrust case against Microsoft was settled in 2001, three years after it began, the internet market had shifted sharply.\n\nIt is still worth trying to check the power of the biggest tech companies, said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, who teaches antitrust law at Vanderbilt University.\n\n“But it does suggest that it’s a problem that antitrust law moves so slowly and courts should move as quickly as they reasonably can to decide these cases,” she added.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/technology/meta-ruling-silicon-valley-start-ups.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"17:56:23-05:00","title":"Meta’s Victory Opens the Way for Silicon Valley to Go Deal Shopping","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge has ruled that Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp did not violate antitrust laws, marking a significant victory for the company and a turning point for Silicon Valley’s acquisition practices.

Spending vast sums of money to swallow up competitors was off the table. Even snapping up the smallest of start-ups could bring unwanted regulatory attention.\n\nAfter this week, that tacit understanding may no longer be in effect.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that Meta had not illegally stifled competition when it bought two nascent rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, more than a decade ago. The decision was a sweeping victory for the social media giant — and more broadly for Silicon Valley, which has relied on big companies buying smaller ones to fuel the innovation engine.\n\nNow Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, as well as the leaders of Google, Microsoft and others, may be able to resume buying young start-ups to stay ahead of the pack. The decision came not a moment too soon, as the tech industry spends billions of dollars to compete on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Meta antitrust ruling “will eliminate a lot of the gymnastics that the major acquirers are going through, and it should really open the door” for more deals, said Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at the venture capital firm Theory Ventures.\n\nMeta declined to comment on whether it would begin buying companies again. Jennifer Newstead, the company’s chief legal officer, said the judge’s ruling “recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.” She added that the company would continue to work with the White House “and to invest in America.”\n\nBuying start-ups has long been a core part of Silicon Valley’s circle of life. Venture capital firms invest in young firms hoping that a few become home runs like Google, Meta or Uber. The start-ups that do not turn into megahits still hold something of value to bigger firms, including fresh talent, new ideas or cutting-edge products.\n\nFor years, tech’s biggest players paid premiums to gobble up their would-be competitors. In 2006, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion, which was considered a whopping sum at the time. YouTube is now valued at roughly $500 billion, analysts said.\n\nGoogle also acquired Android, the basis for its mobile operating system, for $50 million in 2005, and Waze, the maps start-up, for just over $1 billion in 2013. Both Android and Waze have become central to Google’s offerings.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, snapped up Instagram, WhatsApp and other small start-ups. Those services have become a major part of Meta’s offerings, with billions of users. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg tried to buy Snapchat, though that purchase never materialized.\n\nBut the deal-making cooled this decade. After President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appointed Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission in 2021, she pursued a more hawkish strategy against tech acquisitions. The Justice Department also started investigating Amazon, Apple and Google for anticompetitive practices.\n\nBig tech companies were forced to get creative. Many began striking deals that were acquisitions in all but name. These were often known as “acquihires,” which meant the companies paid millions to hire the top talent of a start-up but not the rest of the organization. That left the zombie carcasses of many companies littered across Silicon Valley.\n\nThese everything-but-the-company deals became especially important in the A.I. boom. In June, Meta invested $14.9 billion for a 49 percent stake in ScaleAI, a data labeling start-up, and hired its chief executive, Alexandr Wang, to be Meta’s chief A.I. officer. ScaleAI promptly downsized its work force after Meta’s investment, and a small team of its A.I. researchers joined Mr. Wang at Meta. ScaleAI is still operating, but without its founder, key employees and some former clients.\n\nIn July, Google spent $2.4 billion to hire the leaders of Windsurf, another A.I. start-up. As part of the deal, Google also paid for a nonexclusive license for Windsurf technology. And last year Google, Microsoft and Amazon all struck similar deals for the start-ups Character.AI, Inflection and Adept.\n\nOver time, these hiring deals have hurt the start-up ecosystem by devaluing the equity of young companies and letting only a few people profit, Mr. Tunguz said. “It breaks the social contract of Silicon Valley” where everybody should benefit, he said.\n\nSince President Trump’s inauguration, tech companies have been hopeful that regulators would be more friendly toward deals. Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, said Tuesday’s ruling in the Meta antitrust case would help with that.\n\n“The thing that most people are happy about is the clarity,” he said. “Tech markets hate uncertainty.”\n\nStrange deal structures may no longer be required for tech companies to get their hands on hot A.I. assets, added Samuel N.

Women Who Broke Trump’s Grip on Congress\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T16:57:23-05:00\n\nToday’s Republican Party is big on manliness and masculine virtues. The MAGA right in particular is forever obsessing over who is the biggest, the strongest, the most fearless among them.\n\nThis is why, watching President Trump’s fight to keep a lid on the Epstein files, I have been struck, delighted even, that among the vanishingly few Republican lawmakers with the courage to defy him have been three fire-breathing congresswomen: Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\nLove ’em or hate ’em, these House troublemakers bucked their party leadership, stared down their president and made possible Tuesday’s vote to compel the administration to come clean about the web of degeneracy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein. In the end, all but one Republican joined every Democrat to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. This victory speaks to the value of having women’s voices, and strength, inside the Republican echo chamber, a place that can still be tough for women to navigate.\n\nAside from Representative Thomas Massie, the Republicans’ chief crusader for Epstein transparency, Representatives Boebert, Greene and Mace did more than the rest of their conference combined to keep the heat on Mr. Trump by signing the discharge petition to force a vote on Mr. Massie’s bill, sponsored with Ro Khanna, a Democrat. No other Republicans dared cross the president, who, in characteristic mob-boss fashion, made clear that support for the measure would be considered a “hostile act.”\n\nTrue to his word, Mr. Trump worked to bully the rebels into submission. For months, he tried a variety of carrots and sticks on Ms. Boebert. His top aides even called her into the Situation Room for … a friendly chat. He has repeatedly torn into Ms. Greene, calling her a “traitor” and expressing eagerness to support a primary challenger against her in next year’s midterms. His toxic tirades have resulted in Ms. Greene receiving death threats from his followers, she has said. And, yes, she recognizes the irony, Ms. Greene told CNN.\n\nSubtle this president is not. But his strong-arm tactics only caused Ms. Boebert to dig in, those close to her told The Times. Ms. Greene has responded with open aggression, leaning into her public feud with the president.\n\n“As a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel,” she said in a long social media post on Saturday. At a news conference before the vote on Tuesday featuring several of Mr. Epstein’s victims, Ms. Greene directly clapped back at the president for calling her a traitor: “Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves. A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me.” Ouch.\n\nIn some ways, the three Republican women were perfectly positioned to force the Epstein issue. Ms. Mace loves the media spotlight, has a history of going against her party’s leadership (just ask Kevin McCarthy, whom she helped oust as speaker) and, more to the point, has long championed the victims of sexual abuse, a horror she has talked about enduring herself. Ms. Boebert and Ms. Greene are some of the House’s rowdiest, most anti-establishment zealots, and while their ultra-MAGA credentials have led them to stick with Mr. Trump in the past, those credentials now make it harder for Mr. Trump to dismiss them as faithless RINO squishes — though Lord knows he’s trying.\n\nA tiny group of women taking a stand on a sex scandal may seem an awkward fit for a Republican Party awash in machismo. Girl power or women’s solidarity or “believing women” has never played all that well within the party. For all their talk about God-given gender differences, Republicans can be squirrelly when it comes to gendered political perspectives. For years, I listened to numerous party players pooh-pooh the very notion of “women’s issues.” More recently, the emerging view seems to be that the feminization of politics and culture is destroying America.\n\nAnd yet. Women make up only 14 percent of the House Republican conference (about 15 percent if you count nonvoting delegates), but they accounted for 75 percent of the Republicans who forced Tuesday’s Epstein vote. That math intrigues me.\n\nSadly, most of the Republican women in the House lacked the stomach for this fight. They sat on the sidelines for weeks, letting their more audacious colleagues absorb the president’s wrath. Then, after Mr. Trump folded and gave the go-ahead to support the bill, all but one member of the conference rushed to get on the right side of the vote. (Two members did not cast votes.)\n\nThis spineless opportunism disappointed me more in some lawmakers than in others. Representative Elise Stefanik, a member of leadership, spent her pre-MAGA years in Congress striving to make her party more friendly to women. Given that she recently announced a run for governor of New York, you’d think she’d be looking for ways to reassure home-state voters that she is indeed more than just a Trump toady. Throwing her weight behind the Epstein files petition could have been a prime opportunity. Heavy sigh.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where this fight goes from here. Following the House’s near-unanimous passage, the Senate was reportedly looking to quickly follow suit.\n\nThis speaks well of Republican senators’ sense of self-preservation. The G.O.P.’s pathetic showing in the recent elections suggests voters are growing weary of Trumpian chaos, corruption and moral degeneracy. Republican lawmakers would be smart to start distancing themselves from their president’s worst impulses and excesses, to begin scraping off the layers of moral grime accumulated through their years of bootlicking.\n\nMr. Trump will take such attempts badly. But if Republican lawmakers need any advice on how to man up and grow a spine, I can think of a few of their female colleagues in the House they can ask.\n\nMichelle Cottle writes about national politics for Opinion.

Documentary You’re Watching?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-18T09:34:14-05:00\n\nLike a surging viral outbreak, A.I.-generated video has suddenly become inescapable. It’s infiltrated our social feeds and wormed its way into political discourse. But documentarians have been bracing for impact since before most of us even knew what the technology could do.\n\nDocumentaries fundamentally traffic in issues of truth, transparency and trust. If they use so-called synthetic materials but present them as if they’re “real,” it’s not just a betrayal of the tacit contract between filmmaker and audience. The implications are far broader, and far more serious: a century of shared history is in jeopardy.\n\nAt a time when the idea of facts and shared reality is assaulted from every side, the turning point has arrived. The stakes couldn’t be higher. And we all need to pay attention.\n\nWHISPERS THAT DOCUMENTARIANS were using materials created with generative A.I. started surfacing several years ago. “Roadrunner,” the 2021 film about Anthony Bourdain, set off controversy when it failed to disclose that several lines of his “voice-over” had been generated with software trained on existing samples. That one made the news. But in other productions, sometimes cloaked by nondisclosure agreements, more was going on than many audiences knew.\n\nIn 2023, a group of documentary producers formed the Archival Producers Alliance and published an open letter to their industry calling for greater transparency, listing ways generative A.I had been used without disclosure.\n\nYou might be shocked by what they pointed out: artificially created historical voices, which lead audiences “to believe they are hearing authentic primary sources when they are not”; “A.I.-generated ‘historical’ images”; “fake newspaper articles”; and “nonexistent historical artifacts.”\n\nIn other words, you may have watched a documentary in the last few years and thought what you were seeing was real — but it wasn’t.\n\nOf course we’re all aware that what we see in a video or a movie isn’t necessarily “real.” We know about C.G.I. and camera trickery and the ability to manipulate images. But until very recently, it took a fair amount of skill, or at least time and money, to make realistic fake videos. You would need the resources of a Hollywood studio, and even then it might look a little janky.\n\nBut with documentaries, there’s also a kind of social contract. We believe that what they show us happened, with some exceptions. Re-enactments have become more common in recent years, but filmmakers have developed a visual vocabulary for those staged scenes: they’re dreamy, a little blurry, usually faceless. You immediately know what you’re looking at, because it doesn’t look “real.”\n\nThese conventions exist to preserve our trust in what we’re viewing. If you’re watching historical images of a civil rights march or scenes from a family birthday party, you believe that a producer dug up that footage.\n\nBut finding and shooting footage is expensive and takes time. And that’s exactly what today’s documentarians are often not afforded — especially when they’re working on ripped-from-the-headlines films for the bottomless content pits that are streaming platforms. The temptation is clearly there to plug a prompt into A.I.; sometimes that’s even the mandate from on high. Who will know, right?\n\nWhen OpenAI demonstrated the first version of its Sora video generator in early 2024, the company used “historical footage of California during the Gold Rush” as a demo prompt. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in 2023 for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied those claims.)\n\nMembers of the Archival Producers Alliance, seasoned producers and directors, saw exactly how damaging this trend could be, not just for documentaries but also for the shared public record. In 2024, they announced a comprehensive set of best practices. The guiding principle is transparency and trust: The audience should know when any A.I. tool is used — perhaps to enhance a damaged photo, sharpen an audio clip or create a voice from written text and recordings.\n\nBut this may be even more important: The guidelines are concerned with protecting history itself — with not “muddying the historical record.” If enhanced or generated material is used, the alliance suggests, the disclosure should be made onscreen, not saved for the credits. Why? Every film that’s streamed can be sliced, diced and clipped. Any piece then becomes part of “the archive” — discoverable online and divorced from the larger context of the film, making it easy for someone to assume the clip is real.\n\nThat’s scary enough. But believe it or not, A.I. raises an even bigger issue for documentaries — and, in turn, for all of us.\n\nIN SEPTEMBER, A CLIP SURFACED in which a black garbage bag was apparently tossed from a White House window. The White House press office said a contractor was doing routine maintenance. But President Trump falsely declared the clip was A.I. anyway, and made some revealing remarks.\n\n“One of the problems we have with A.I., it’s both good and bad,” he said. “If something happens, really bad, just blame A.I. But also they create things. You know, it works both ways.”\n\nThat phenomenon has a name: “liar’s dividend,” a term coined by two law professors in 2019. The idea is simple. We’re becoming more aware of how easy it is to create convincing fake videos, which means people who claim real videos are fake are becoming more persuasive, too. If they’re caught on video but claim the video is A.I., we’re more likely to believe them. Or at least we might feel pangs of doubt.\n\nWith the release of OpenAI’s video generator Sora 2 in September, the world irrevocably changed. Once the software is widely available, it will be possible for anyone to make a video of pretty much anything, and fast.\n\nMost people can understand the obvious consequence of this earthshaking moment. Every video is now Schrodinger’s video: it’s both real and not real. We can take the liar’s dividend one frightening step further. In this brave new world, no claim that a video is real will ever be fully persuasive.\n\nThis raises an issue that documentarians have been worried about for years. Since cameras became a reliable way to film news, we’ve depended on video archives to preserve our shared history. Thanks to portable camera technology, hundreds of thousands of hours of history exist on film and hard drives, in libraries and archives, showing us what really happened. At times, that footage shocks us and contradicts the stories we like to tell ourselves. History is written by the victors, but those accounts could be undercut by the tape.\n\nThat’s one reason documentaries are so important: For many, they’re the only way to discover those histories and, sometimes, learn the truth. A history book can teach you a lot; a moving image gets inside your soul.\n\nAs recording equipment has become more accessible, this has proved only more true. A major line of defense against excessive force by the police has been videos filmed by bystanders. Documentaries about human rights atrocities now routinely depend on video shot by civilians and activists. Audiences have had their eyes opened and inherited narratives disrupted.\n\nBUT WE ARE LIVING IN DANGEROUS TIMES. Technologies like Sora 2 have made it ridiculously simple for an unscrupulous producer (or a racist troll) to whip up footage in a matter of moments. Because the software generates video based on the data set it was trained on, it is filled with biases and blind spots; attempts to “fix” the bias can have unexpected ramifications, as when Google’s Gemini created photorealistic images of Nazis as people of color. A.I. makes images that, used irresponsibly, literally rewrite history.\n\nAny of these videos could end up in the archive, adrift on the internet to be discovered in 15 years by some schoolchild. Or now by well-meaning assistants working on a low-budget streaming documentary they have to finish so they can pay rent.\n\nTheoretically, fixes exist. Sora videos carry a tiny label, as well as an invisible digital fingerprint and “extra guardrails,” though OpenAI has not specified what those might be. Other companies could do the same, and software could be developed to detect A.I.-generated video. Governments could regulate software or require these measures.\n\nBut at the speed that these technologies are unleashed, staying ahead is virtually impossible. Hackers have figured out how to remove the Sora label. Governments have to be willing to regulate companies and enforce those laws. And given the potential for misinformation, there’s no reason to imagine state actors won’t circumvent guardrails.\n\nThen there’s this problem: A.I. video generators are trained on a large data set that includes documentaries. They can ably imitate the visual vocabulary of the form — talking heads, sweeping shots and other elements we expect from authoritative films. I could prompt a generator to create a film in the style of, say, Ken Burns about aliens that would look very “real.” I could post it to YouTube, and by the time Burns disavowed the film, it could have gone viral.\n\nWhile muddying the historical record is a huge problem, let’s not forget the liar’s dividend. In a world where we are primed to doubt all video evidence, documentaries — which depend entirely on trust — are swept into the net. So now, a documentary made up of footage that challenges power or makes a viewer feel uncomfortable — like this year’s “2000 Meters to Andriivka” (with Ukrainian soldiers’ helmet camera scenes) and “The Perfect Neighbor” (using body camera material) — is much easier to dismiss altogether. Even a film with a hot-mic confession like Robert Durst’s in “The Jinx” (2015) is suddenly far more questionable.\n\nDOCUMENTARIANS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING BACK. The newly formed Trust in Archives Initiative, for instance, is working on ways to authenticate and protect genuine archival materials. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity is developing an open technical standard that can certify the source of online content, and representatives from the tech giants Google, Amazon, Meta and OpenAI are on the steering committee. Organizations like Witness are working with people documenting human rights violations, equipping them with resources for collecting video that is harder to discredit and helping authenticate material in real time.\n\nBut in my conversations with documentarians, it’s clear that A.I. video creation tools — and companies’ seemingly lax attitude toward their implications — have created a sense of not just urgency but desperation. A responsible approach, documentarians say, would involve “future-proofing”: companies developing technology with stakeholders who can speak to the human cost of the product and recommend steps to mitigate the damage. On the whole, that’s not happening.\n\nWhich means it falls to us — and filmmakers and studios like Netflix and Amazon — to find ways to keep alive values like trust and authenticity. This probably means the documentaries we watch will change shape a little, and using the Archival Producers Alliance guidelines is a good start. Developing voluntary industrywide certifications that help audiences identify responsibly made films, like the “Certified Organic” sticker on produce, might also help.\n\nMore documentarians might start inserting themselves into their movies, explaining to viewers how they were made. A filmmaker can lie, of course, but the added layer of human connection may instill confidence.\n\nThe current market for documentaries is dismal. The demand from streaming platforms for movies about crimes, cults and celebrities leads to slapdash aesthetics and rushed timelines. In that market, the temptation to use A.I.-generated footage is high, and it’s often rewarded by viewers. In a real sense, we are part of the problem. Just going to the theater to see a documentary, or paying a few bucks to digitally rent one with high artistic standards, can go a long way toward reviving the market.\n\nThis sounds bleak, because it is. But that doesn’t mean it’s entirely hopeless. Our shared history deserves protection, and we all need to be part of the solution. Perhaps documentarians are the ones best suited to help us rethink what trust, transparency and authenticity really look like when we can’t believe our eyes.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/nyregion/eric-adams-trips-travel-uzbekistan-israel.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"16:03:44-05:00","title":"Eric Adams, Still the Mayor, Is Increasingly Out of Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eric Adams, the former Mayor of New York City, has intensified his international travel during the final months of his term, visiting countries such as Albania, Israel, and Uzbekistan, with significant portions of his time spent abroad—spanning over 48 days in a short period.

abundantly clear: He loves to travel abroad — optics, an abandoned indictment and propriety be damned.\n\nIn his first three years in office, he visited Qatar (for the 2022 World Cup), Greece (to discuss antisemitism), Italy (to meet the Pope), Israel (to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu), and Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia (to urge would-be migrants not to come to New York City). Earlier this year, he traveled to the Dominican Republic to show solidarity after a deadly nightclub collapse.\n\nBut in the waning weeks of Mr. Adams’s administration, the pace of his travel is picking up and the city is footing much of the bill.\n\nMr. Adams has strenuously defended his mayoral wanderlust, waving off periodic questions about whether it was appropriate to be leaving New York City so frequently, especially after he was indicted on corruption charges that focused, in part, on improper foreign travel.\n\n“I was a little boy that had a dream of traveling the globe,” he said in December 2023. “And I’m living out that dream.”\n\nWith the indictment now dismissed and the end of his single term fast approaching, Mr. Adams has taken his globe-trotting to new heights. In early October, the mayor flew to Albania for a four-day trip that his aides said was designed to stoke business and tourism. On Friday, he returned to Israel for a four-day trip to meet with business leaders and politicians, including Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nAnd when he left Israel on Tuesday, it was not to head home — but rather to embark on a five-day trip to Uzbekistan.\n\nThat means that in the 48 days between Oct. 6, when he landed in Albania, and Sunday, when he is scheduled to return to New York, Mr. Adams will have spent roughly 27 percent of his time thousands of miles away from the city he governs.\n\nAnd there may be more mayoral travel in the offing: He has discussed with aides his desire to travel to several countries in Africa before his term expires Jan. 1.\n\nThese journeys are not cheap, in part because he travels with a retinue: a security detail and a variable number of aides. Mr. Adams brought six advisers to Israel, one to Albania and one to Uzbekistan.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr. Adams declined to reveal how much New York City taxpayers were spending on these international expeditions, but they suggested the cost was worth it.\n\n“The mayor has long emphasized the importance of honoring and uplifting New York City’s diverse communities, whether he is celebrating different heritages at Gracie Mansion or discussing innovation and economic development with foreign officials abroad,” said Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor who accompanied him to Israel. “The mayor continues to govern, lead, and deliver for this city regardless of where he is.”\n\nThe mayor’s episodic absence from City Hall is one of several signs that he is no longer particularly concerned with what people think about his job performance. He has stopped conducting weekly question-and-answer sessions with reporters. In June, he hosted two conservative influencers — one an OnlyFans model, the other a content creator banned by YouTube and Twitch for spreading misinformation and making comments that were deemed antisemitic — to Gracie Mansion for cigars and an interview.\n\nAnd earlier this month, he sat for a cringe-worthy interview with the comedian Ziwe, during which she asked him if he was jealous to see George Santos supplant him as President Trump’s “new favorite criminal.” (The Trump Justice Department abandoned the indictment in apparent exchange for the mayor’s help with the president’s deportation agenda.)\n\nMr. Adams has traveled broadly for years, dating back to his time as Brooklyn borough president and a New York state senator. But as mayor, his past foreign trips became fodder for federal prosecutors, who accused him of accepting free and heavily discounted airfare to countries around the world, and of soliciting illegal foreign donations and channeling them through straw donors.\n\nOther New York City mayors have traveled, though few as frequently as Mr. Adams has in recent months. Every mayor has visited Israel since Vincent R. Impellitteri traveled there by ship in 1951. Bill de Blasio took a nearly 10-day visit to Italy during his first year in office in 2014. Michael R. Bloomberg took many trips, often flying his private plane to Bermuda or Palm Beach, Fla. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was known mainly for his love of domestic travel, visited Israel during his final weeks as mayor in 2001, raising eyebrows for using an airplane that belonged to Mr. Trump. David N. Dinkins visited South Africa and France.\n\nIf there is precedent for Mr. Adams’s global gallivanting, it can be found in the international peregrinations of Jimmy Walker, the Jazz Age mayor who ultimately resigned in disgrace, according to Terry Golway, an adjunct history professor at the College of Staten Island.\n\nIn 1931, a full year before Mr. Walker left office and journeyed to Paris to be with his showgirl paramour, he traveled to Cannes, where he met with the King of Iraq, even though he did not know where Iraq was.\n\n“In Walker’s case, he’s schmoozing with the king of a country he’s never heard of in the French Riviera while there are bread lines in his city,” Mr. Golway said. “In Adams’s case, I guess, what does he care about public opinion any more? But it seems to me to be such a disrespect for the taxpayers of New York City.”\n\nThere is some sort of logic behind Mr. Adams’s choice of travel destinations, particularly Israel. The New York City area is home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, and the mayor is a fervent defender of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Adams is also a staunch opponent of Zohran Mamdani, his imminent successor, who is an outspoken critic of Israel and has said he will not travel there.\n\nOn Tuesday, his fourth and last day in the country, Mr. Adams toured Kfar Aza, an Israeli kibbutz near the Gaza border that was attacked by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023. He also met with Israel Ganz, the head of a regional council of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\n“Adams is a true friend of the settlement movement,” Mr. Ganz wrote in a post on Facebook describing his meeting with Mr. Adams. Mr. Ganz said he gave Mr. Adams an art piece made from the fragments of an Iranian missile that hit an area under the council’s jurisdiction during Israel’s war with Iran in June.\n\nMr. Adams has also argued that it is important for the mayor to honor all the communities represented in New York City, though New Yorkers who identify as Albanian make up only 0.5 percent of the city’s population, while New Yorkers who identify as Uzbek make up only 0.3 percent. Mr. Adams has hosted roughly 100 flag-raising ceremonies in Lower Manhattan for countries big and small, including Israel, Albania and Uzbekistan.\n\nMr. Levy said that Mr. Adams decided to travel to Uzbekistan after Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the country’s president, invited him during an event in Washington earlier this month. In October, a spokeswoman for Mr. Adams who has since left his administration said he had traveled to Albania at the invitation of Prime Minister Edi Rama.\n\nAnother possible motive: Mr. Adams has suggested that he is seeking post-mayoral employment overseas.\n\nJohn Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good government group, said that the mayor’s use of taxpayer dollars for the trips was unethical, but unsurprising.\n\n“Eric Adams’s continues to be one of the most disastrous mayoralties ever in New York City history,” Mr. Kaehny said. “This is kind of par for the course.”\n\nJohnatan Reiss contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/business/economy/suisun-city-makes-an-offer-to-california-forever.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:17:58-05:00","title":"A City Is Broke.

California Forever’s hope is to build a new, up-from-the-ground city on yellow hills dotted with sheep and wind turbines.\n\nThe point of the Suisun annexation is for each side to help the other solve a problem. California Forever’s problem is that it wants to build on unincorporated land in Solano County, which has a law forbidding the building of much of anything outside established cities. Suisun’s problem is that it is broke.\n\nIf the idea is approved, Suisun would absorb California Forever’s land, turning the rural plot into a developable area — all while expanding Suisun’s footprint and securing a gusher of future tax revenue if and when anything ever gets built.\n\n“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Alma Hernandez, the mayor of Suisun, told me in a recent interview.\n\nCalifornia Forever has been provoking superlatives, good and bad, since the project was revealed two years ago. The company’s long-term plan is to build a walkable city of up to 400,000 people, about an hour north of San Francisco, with a manufacturing center and nearby shipbuilding facility along the Sacramento River. Renderings show a Brooklyn-esque neighborhood packed with three-to-five-story buildings surrounded by parks, plazas and farmers’ markets.\n\nSuisun City is hoping to revitalize its tax base by annexing agricultural land, including more than 22,000 acres owned by a company called California Forever.\n\nDetail area\n\nSan Francisco\n\nProposed annexation\n\nSuisun City\n\nApprox. area of\n\nCalifornia Forever\n\ndevelopment\n\nSacramento R.\n\nSolano County\n\nThe New York Times\n\nBecause the idea is so big and audacious, and its backers so rich, the reaction for and against the project has been supercharged. Boosters say it could transform the region’s economy, revive the middle class and stanch the outflow of businesses from California to neighboring states. Skeptics say it would eviscerate farmland and turn a quaint community into the civic equivalent of a shell company beholden to tech moguls.\n\nLate last month, when Suisun hosted a community meeting in a local event space to discuss the proposal, there were baskets of Oreos and Nutter Butters along with four policemen stationed across the room. The meeting began with calls for respect and civility. The shouting began shortly after.\n\n“I’m of the opinion that this is a scam,” said Andrew Russo, a retired civil servant who lives in downtown Suisun and was sitting near the front in a white fedora.\n\n“The door is right there,” said Bret Prebula, the city manager of Suisun, after other hecklers joined in.\n\n“The door is there for you, too!” Mr. Russo replied.\n\n“All the people who are young enough to work are interested in hearing about the opportunity,” Alicia Mijares, the business representative for a local sheet metal workers’ union and a supporter of the project, shouted across the room at Mr. Russo.\n\n“Opportunities!” Mr. Russo guffawed back at her. “You think they care about you?”\n\nAs the room devolved into arguments and side chatter, Mr. Prebula took the tone of an angry teacher with an unruly class.\n\n“If this happens again, we’re done,” he said.\n\nTo understand how a plan this big and contentious landed in Suisun — a city that The San Francisco Chronicle once rated as the worst place to live in the Bay Area — you need to know a bit of its crazy back story. It goes like this.\n\nIn 2017 a mysterious company called Flannery Associates started amassing farmland in an eastern corner of Solano County. Flannery had no known business, shareholders or employees, yet in the space of a few years it spent about $950 million on about 70,000 acres, an area twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nEveryone knew it was a front, but couldn’t figure out for what. Chinese spies? A new Disneyland?\n\nThe truth turned out to be even stranger: billionaires with plans to build an urbanist's fever dream from scratch.\n\nThe company is run by a former Goldman Sachs trader named Jan Sramek, and his investors are a who’s who of Silicon Valley. They include Michael Moritz and Marc Andreessen, both venture capitalists; Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn; Laurene Powell-Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs; and Patrick and John Collison, the sibling founders of the payments company Stripe.\n\nAfter The New York Times revealed the company’s intentions and funders in 2023, California Forever was born, and Mr. Sramek began selling his plan. Locals responded by calling it “oligarch city” and starting groups like Solano Together and California4Never.\n\nAssuming California Forever is like every other decades-long construction venture, the plans will change over time and many of the people talking about them today will be dead before it’s completed. So what the company is really asking locals for is their trust. And, as the fractious meetings show, this has yet to be fully earned.\n\nThe most frequent point of contention is the company’s past deception: How can you trust a group that spent years suggesting to local officials that Flannery/California Forever was a passive buyer of farmland? There are also the company’s hardball tactics, such as suing a group of holdout farmers in a $510 million antitrust case.\n\nIn the beginning, Mr. Sramek’s pitch was heavily centered on addressing California’s housing shortage, and it seemed that anytime he showed up at a meeting all anyone did was yell at him. Today, however, while California Forever still wants to build housing, its emphasis has shifted toward developing a local factory sector, and the reaction has gone from almost entirely negative to more mixed.\n\nThere are still a lot of shouters like Mr. Russo. But the company has become a local power player with Solano offices and Solano employees. Both California Forever and Suisun City have signed agreements to use local trade unions on future work, hence the contingent of cement masons and sheet metal workers who showed up to the recent meeting in hats bearing the names of their locals.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, Bob Megary, 72, walked across the street to a stool in Lucy’s, a spare and hard-looking bar on Main Street, the sort of place where everyone looks in unison at whoever walks through the door. Mr. Megary is a retired ironworker who moved to Suisun for a $200,000 house and spent his career racking up miles of road and hours of sports radio driving to job sites in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. That’s a typical arrangement in Solano, which is the Bay Area’s lowest-income county.\n\nMr. Megary is so enthusiastic about California Forever’s project that he has become a paid ambassador whose job is to evangelize its benefits to blue-collar workers like him.\n\n“This what we need to keep our kids here,” he said of the project.\n\nA longstanding question in Solano County is whether Suisun is capable of being city at all. The town is perennially strapped and sits next to the larger city of Fairfield (population: about 120,000). A half-century ago there were discussions about combining the two neighbors, and in the decades since Suisun officials have argued again and again that they are just one project away from financial stability.\n\nFirst it was a new subdivision on the edge of town. Then it was the Walmart Supercenter and high hopes for cannabis taxes. Each project was followed by a budget crunch and lamentations. The receipts did not live up to the hype.\n\n“This city, honestly, if you really look at its history, it should have not survived up until now,” Mayor Hernandez said.\n\nHer City Hall office looks out on the tall grasses and bobbing boats in the Suisun Slough, which connects to the San Francisco Bay and made the area a local shipping center in the late 1800s. It is in a white building with a glass dome that was put up in 1989 when the city was briefly flush.\n\nThanks to state redevelopment funds, the city was able to build the government complex (the previous City Hall was a trailer) that connects to a waterfront park where people cast fishing lines in the slough. But the redevelopment program didn’t spark the economy as much as people hoped, and the city has struggled with upkeep. Last year, with the city’s finances bleeding out, voters approved a new sales tax. Had it failed, Suisun may have had to dissolve as a city.\n\nDuring a recent tour of downtown Ms. Hernandez thanked me when I bought an ice cream sandwich and again when I bought a comic book. Along the way, as we passed sights like an out-of-business smoke shop and empty lots wrapped in cyclone fencing, she argued that the city’s money problems stemmed from decades of being boxed in. There’s a marsh on one side, Fairfield on another and Travis Air Force Base next to that. When California Forever announced its plan to build east of the city, Ms. Hernandez said, she took it for granted that Suisun would get encroached on again.\n\nInstead it created an opportunity. California Forever’s original plan was to run a ballot initiative that, if passed, would carve a hole in the county law prohibiting development of agricultural land. The polling was bad, and the proposal was pulled before the election. A few months later Mr. Prebula, the city manager, reached out to ask about a possible annexation, which is now called the Suisun Expansion Plan.\n\n“Suisun is a city that wants to not just talk about jobs and homes, but actually deliver them,” Mr. Sramek said.\n\nSuisun is merely exploring the idea, with California Forever paying for the various consultant reports and environmental studies that have to be completed before the proposal can be voted on. The final approval would come from the Local Agency Formation Commission, the body that decides the borders of cities in Solano County.\n\nThis is all years away in a story that is certain to have many more twists. But, for now, Ms. Hernandez said it felt nice to be reaching for the future instead of always defending the past.\n\n“It’s a little city recognizing that it has leverage,” she said.\n\n"}]}
