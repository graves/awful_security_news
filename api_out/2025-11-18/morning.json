expected opening in late 2030 – a two-year delay from the earlier estimate, the Maryland Transportation Authority  said .\n \n\n   \n  That price tag is more than double the previous expected cost of

major hub for imports and exports of commodities – fell apart after a cargo ship hit one of its pillars in the early hours of March 26, 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The container ship, Dali, suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures minutes before the crash,  according  to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board.

sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl, who wanted to describe how television viewers formed “para-social” relationships with TV personalities, the dictionary said in a statement Tuesday.\n \n\n

 A key example cited by Cambridge Dictionary is singer Taylor Swift, who announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce this year, with many fans talking of their heartfelt feelings toward a couple

those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it’s completely one sided.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambridge Dictionary also highlighted a number of other words that it said have had a “significant impact” this year.\n \n\n   \n  Among their number is “slop,” defined as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by artificial intelligence,” as well as “memeify,” or “to turn an event, image, person, etc. into a meme.”\n \n\n   \n  And the dictionary added 6,000 new words this year, with notable newbies including “delulu,” “skibidi” and “tradwife.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/roblox-ai-age-verification-youth-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"New AI Age Verification Aims to Block Roblox Kids From Chatting With Adults","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roblox, the popular online gaming platform with over 150 million users—including one-third under 13—is introducing mandatory age verification to prevent minors from chatting with adults.

New AI age verification aims to block them from chatting with adults \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  If Roblox users want to chat on the online gaming platform, they’ll soon have to verify their age by providing a government ID or by letting an artificial intelligence age estimation tool photograph their face.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes as the platform faces a string of lawsuits and other claims that it has enabled sexual predators to connect with and abuse children. Roblox said the updated policy will make it easier to prevent young users from connecting with adult strangers.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox is a platform where users can create and play online games and interact with each other. Unlike many other online platforms, Roblox allows users under the age of 13; the platform has long advertised itself as a fun way for children to learn how to code. It has more than 150 million users globally, one third of whom are under 13.\n \n\n   \n  But the company has come under a microscope following reports of children being groomed, abused and, in some cases, even  kidnapped  by adults they met on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys general of  Kentucky  and  Louisiana  filed separate lawsuits accusing Roblox of harming children earlier this year. Florida’s attorney general also filed a  criminal subpoena  seeking information from the company last month and calling Roblox a “breeding ground for predators.”\n \n\n   \n  Individual families have also sued the company, including  Becca Dallas , who alleges her 15-year-old son, Ethan, died by suicide after being groomed via Roblox and messaging site Discord.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox already has some policies and features in place meant to protect young users; for example, it offers parental controls, blocks the sharing of photos and personal information and uses human and AI text and voice moderation. It also requires users to verify their age in order to access certain “17+” experiences, such as games with heavy violence or crude humor. But the update announced Tuesday is expected to greatly increase the number of users verifying their age on the platform, executives said on a call with reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “Our priority is safety and civility,” said Roblox Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman. “We want to make Roblox a safe, positive, age-appropriate experience for everybody. We set extremely high standards for ourselves, and we understand that the public expects the same from us.”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement coincides with a planned “virtual protest” within Roblox, planned by the nonprofit ParentsTogether Action, to call for more youth safety features on the platform, including stronger default privacy protections for users under 13.   It also comes amid a wider push by online platforms to determine users’ ages to protect young people;  YouTube  and  Meta  are among the other popular apps using AI for age estimates, although the tools vary across platforms.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new policy, all users will be required to verify their age before accessing chat features on Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If users choose not to upload an ID, they’ll have to photograph their faces so AI can estimate their age, using technology from identity verification firm Persona. The tool uses the front camera on a user’s device and prompts them to move their face in specific directions, in an effort to ensure a real person is doing the verification. The AI will place users in an estimated age range — under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20 or 21+ — and they’ll only be allowed to chat with other users in or near that range.\n \n\n   \n  A user estimated to be 12 years old, for example, would be able to chat with users ages 15 and younger but not 16 and older, according to Roblox.\n \n\n   \n  If the AI places someone into the wrong age group, users over 13 can upload an ID to correct their age. Parents whose accounts are linked to their child’s via Roblox’s parental control tools can also correct their child’s age. (ID checks are available only to users older than 13, likely because online privacy regulations are more stringent for younger children.)\n \n\n   \n  Roblox says the images of users’ faces will be used only for age estimation, and they’ll be deleted after users are placed in an age bucket.\n \n\n   \n  “We see these changes as a way to help ensure users are able to socialize with others in age groups that are appropriate but also help limit contact between minors and adults that they do not know,” said Rajiv Bhatia, Roblox vice president and head of user and discovery product.\n \n\n   \n  Roblox declined to share a specific accuracy rate for its AI age estimation technology. Kaufman said it is “typically pretty accurate within one or two years” for users between 5 and 25 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Some users have found  workarounds  for other platforms’ face scan age estimation technology, such as by using images of video game characters or selfies of other people. But Kaufman said   Roblox’s technology has “fairly robust fraud checks in place” to determine whether the person is “live” and “moving around and following instructions.” He added that the system also looks for “other anomalies, like people trying to repeat use the same face over and over.”\n \n\n   \n  Roblox will roll out age verification on a voluntary basis   starting Tuesday. It will become mandatory in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands in December, and globally early next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Plan for Gaza Endorsed by UN Security Council","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Security Council passed a 13–0 resolution (with abstentions from Russia and China) endorsing a U.S.-drafted plan centered on Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza proposal.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council passed a  US-drafted resolution  Monday that aims to move beyond the fragile truce in Gaza to a more sustainable peace and the reconstruction of the devastated enclave.\n \n\n   \n  The 15-member council voted 13 to 0 in favor of the resolution, with abstentions by Russia and China, which declined to use their veto power to block the measure.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution was intended to add international legitimacy to US President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza plan , parts of which formed the basis of the ceasefire that took effect in the Gaza Strip last month. The United States had lobbied hard for its passage, which was praised by Trump in a lengthy post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,” Trump wrote Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution authorized elements of the plan, including the establishment of the “Board of Peace” as a transitional authority and the creation of a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, according to a draft seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday that “the members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.”   \n \n\n   \n  Some diplomatic sources said the resolution will help grant the authority for countries to participate in the ISF, as it will now have UN backing.\n \n\n   \n  US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said Monday that the ISF, “a strong coalition of peacekeepers, many from Muslim majority nations like Indonesia, Azerbaijan and others,” will deploy to Gaza “under a unified command” in order to “secure Gaza streets … oversee demilitarization … protect civilians and … escort aid through safe corridors.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had acknowledged the need for an “international mandate” to support the plan. Ahead of the vote, Waltz warned that “a vote against this resolution is a vote to return to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the resolution has passed, many questions remain about its implementation, with the draft appearing vague on sequencing and detail.\n \n\n   \n  Western diplomatic sources have told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect. It has faced scutiny for lacking a clear timeline for the transitional authorities to hand over to the Palestinian Authority, saying only that it will do so once the PA “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.” The resolution authorizes the Board of Peace and other authorized “international civil and security presences” until the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution states that the Board of Peace will oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand – and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the resolution also contains a reference to Palestinian statehood, but it provides no timeline for it.\n \n\n   \n  “After the (Palestinian Authority) reform program is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft said.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  The representative from Russia, one of the two UN Security Council members to abstain from the vote, said it was important that the resolution not become “a death knell for the two state solution.” A representative of China, the other member to abstain, argued that “it seems Palestine is barely visible in it, and the Palestinian sovereignty and ownership are not fully reflected.”\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls on UN member states and international oragnizations to work with the Board “to contribute personnel, equipment, and financial resources to its operating entities and the ISF, to provide technical assistance to its operating entities and the ISF, and to give full recognition to its acts and documents.”\n \n\n   \n   Hamas said Sunday that it considered the draft resolution “an attempt to impose international guardianship over Gaza and promote a vision biased toward the occupation.”\n \n\n   \n  After Monday’s vote, Hamas said that giving any stabilization force “tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality and turns it into a party to the conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians in Gaza were also wary of the resolution, fearing that international forces inside Gaza could do more harm than good for the people trying to rebuild their lives in the enclave.\n \n\n   \n  “Those who are supposed to come now, God willing, may they improve everything for these people,” 38-year-old Umm Shadi al-Balbasi told CNN on Tuesday. “But if they come and end up like the ones before them, no. They must be better than those who came before, because the situation, I’m telling you, is absolutely unbearable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Waltz said after the passage of the resolution that the Board of Peace “will coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, facilitate Gaza’s development and support a technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza civil service and administration while the Palestinian Authority fully implements its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have not expanded in detail on what that reform program would look like.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s President Isaac Herzog called Monday’s resolution “quite an incredible moment in world politics that could only have been carved out by President Trump, and of course, bringing back all our hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to enable a future of hope, and I hope this resolution of the Security Council, plus people-to-people activities and new initiatives … should lead, hopefully, to some sort of a positive outcome,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/style/why-women-art-less-valuable-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:49:00-05:00","title":"Why we pay less for art made by women","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the persistent gender gap in the art market, where works by women are systematically undervalued compared to those by men.

That record is currently held by Georgia O’Keeffe’s 1932 painting “Jimson Weed/White Flower No.1,” which fetched $44.4 million in 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Auctioneers at Sotheby’s have valued “El sueño (La cama)” — “The Dream (The Bed)” — at between $40 and $60 million. Kahlo, who died in 1954, already holds the second-highest auction record for a female artist. “Diego y yo” (“Diego and I”), a self-portrait from 1949, featuring her husband, the artist Diego Rivera, fetched $34.9 million in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  While these are hefty price tags, they are dwarfed by the equivalent for works by men. Even if Kahlo’s painting hits the upper valuation, it will be just a fraction of the male record. Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” sold for an astounding  $450.3 million at Christies in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  The gender gap is not limited to dead artists. Earlier this year, South African Marlene Dumas — who only last week became the first contemporary female artist to join the  Louvre’s  permanent collection — set a record for the highest amount paid for a living female artist. “Miss January,” a large-scale portrait of a semi-nude woman, sold for $13.6 million in May, topping Jenny Saville’s “Propped,” which sold for $12.4 million in 2018. Dumas’ record is not even 15% of the current record for a work by a living male artist  –  Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” sculpture, which sold for just north of $91 million in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  So what is behind this massive disparity? Experts believe misogyny, ageism and male-dominated auction houses and museums are factors influencing how art by women is valued.\n \n\n   \n  A 2021 study highlighted a stark gender bias in how society perceives art. Renée B. Adams, a professor of finance at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, was the lead author of “Gendered Prices,” published in  The Review of Financial Studies  that year.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers showed two groups of participants an identical series of AI-generated artworks and asked them to rate them. One group was shown the works with a male artist’s signature, while others saw the attribution as female. The works supposedly signed by a man were rated higher by regular gallery-goers than those apparently done by a woman.\n \n\n   \n  Adams is currently studying secret postcard auctions, where the artist is supposedly anonymous. “Sometimes, in order to attract people to bid on these postcards, they get very famous artists to participate,” she said, adding that in those cases an artist’s identity can often be inferred from their style.\n \n\n   \n  “If buyers can’t infer identity, there’s no gender difference in price, but as soon as they think they know who the person is, there’s a gender difference in price.”\n \n\n   \n  Adams said the “magnitude” of the gap in the art world stands out from other sectors. “The art market blows all the gender wage gap numbers out of the water,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount in art prices is not driven by merit, but by factors related to societal perceptions of women. It has nothing to do with whether the painting is good or bad.”\n \n\n   \n  As part of her research for her 2020 book “Women Can’t Paint,” artist, writer and art historian Helen Gørrill took a forensic approach to auctioned art.\n \n\n   \n  “I created a spreadsheet of 5,000 paintings on the secondary market, so at big auctions like Sotheby’s, Christie’s, Phillips,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  This led to a startling discovery. Art signed by a man went up in value compared to unsigned work, and women’s artwork actually went down in value when signed, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She believes the art establishment highlights the success of artists like Saville, Kahlo, Bridget Riley and Yayoi Kusama to suggest progress.\n \n\n   \n  “The ones that are doing really well are being bandied up as an example of how well women are doing, but when you analyze it, we’re not at all,” she said. “In the ’90s, we had far more women succeeding. Now the success is being shared by far fewer women, but on a greater scale,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill is currently working on two more books on the subject and said her latest research is no less alarming. Gørrill spoke to artists who were dismissed after having a baby and told their work couldn’t be sold “because people don’t trust it’s going to achieve the value of a male artist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I spoke to some big dealers and they all said their collectors lose trust in women once they’ve had a kid because they’re no longer going to be able to focus fully on their artwork,” she said. “So the value of a woman artist essentially dips because of biology.”\n \n\n   \n  The belief has even been internalized by some in the profession, among them renowned British artist Tracey Emin. In an 2014 interview, she told  Red  Magazine that she thought having children would compromise her work. “There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.”\n \n\n   \n  Ageism, and even beauty standards, have also been been cited as issues women face. Gørrill told CNN that one artist she spoke to recalled a dealer telling her to get Botox because “she looked haggard.” She added: “Her exact words to me were, ‘but men are allowed to be old and ugly.’”\n \n\n   \n  Gørrill lays much of the blame for the situation at the door of museums. “By museums not collecting as many female artists as men, it has a massive impact on collections and on values attributed on the secondary market to artwork, and also what collectors perceive as being valuable or validated as an artwork.”\n \n\n   \n  Valeria Napoleone, an Italian art collector and patron, has spent almost three decades building a collection by women artists. When she started in 1997, she “couldn’t understand why women were sidelined just because of gender,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I told myself ‘I want to create a choir of female voices who have been silenced throughout art history.’” Today, some 560 artworks are spread between her homes and storage units in London, New York and Milan.\n \n\n   \n  While the “discourse” in the wider art world around gender equality has changed, according to Napoleone, there remains a “black hole” when it comes to museums and auction houses, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “As radical as the world of contemporary art is believed to be, it’s a male-dominated field in terms of artists, museums, directors — the whole ecosystem.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s very important to readdress art history through the eyes of a new generation of curators. You don’t want female artists to be like a decorative object on a man’s suit. You want the artist to become part of the fibre of the suit,” she said. “It’s going to take generations to balance it.”\n \n\n   \n  Harriet Loffler is curator at The Women’s Art Collection at Murray Edwards College at Cambridge University — the biggest collection of women’s art in Europe — is more upbeat.\n \n\n   \n  She welcomed the Kahlo auction for “shining a light” on the representation of women. “These success stories are fantastic for women artists,” she told CNN, adding that there have always been female artists but the “canonical” approach to art history has centred on men.\n \n\n   \n  While the museum houses works by such luminaries as Barbara Hepworth, Mary Cassatt, Paula Rego and Tracey Emin, “what’s amazing about our collection is that it’s a constellation not stars,” she told CNN. “The artists aren’t all talking about what it is to be a woman, but they all have something to say. They take up space and there are a number of works that really talk about the symbolic erasure of women artists across art history.”\n \n\n   \n  She believes things are changing, with museums taking affirmative action to redress the imbalance but said: “There is still lots of work to be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On the other side of the Atlantic, the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) was established in Washington DC in the 1980s “in part to rectify the lack of representation of women across art history,” according to Kathryn Wat, its chief curator and deputy director for art, programs and public engagement.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that engaging a global audience is critical to changing the landscape for women artists,” Wat said in an email to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “While women artists have greater recognition now, disparities in scholarly research, the content of museum collections, and market value persist. Statistically women artists continue to be undervalued and overlooked by the broader art market. Our dual mission of advocacy and exhibition remains essential,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The legacy of gender inequality continues to influence economic valuation. Having more and deeper research, more exhibitions, and further exposure of women artists will have an impact on their value within the art market.”\n \n\n   \n  Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby’s, agrees. “In recent years, we’ve witnessed a real and measurable shift — not just in awareness, but also in market confidence and increasing gallery representation and institutional support for women artists,” she said, adding “outstanding results” have been achieved by other female artists, including O’Keeffe and Lee Krasner.\n \n\n   \n  While “El sueño (La cama)” may prove record-breaking, Di Stasi believes “what’s also exciting is the idea of that record continuing to be broken by other artists in the years to come.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/prices-economy-tariff-small-business","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"Everyone is hunkering down.

affordability crisis is rattling mom-and-pop shops \n       \n  By Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the  bulk of the job growth. \n \n\n   \n  Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to the  Kansas City Fed , but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s infuriating,” Scheffel said.\n \n\n   \n  High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM’s employees preoccupied with their own finances.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of our employees are distracted. They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.”\n \n\n   \n  Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are  living paycheck to paycheck , meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.\n \n\n   \n  The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.\n \n\n   \n  Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance  has surged by 120%  for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘So much anxiety’\n \n\n   \n  Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to  estimates  released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.   \n \n\n   \n  Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the  Supreme Court rules  against the Trump administration’s use of  emergency powers to justify  its global tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”\n \n\n   \n    High borrowing costs\n \n\n   \n  Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the SBA  estimates  it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion.

Usually, they’d play poker, sometimes bourré but almost always some sort of card game for money.\n \n\n   \n  “And by the time the plane hit the ground,’’ chuckles one former  NBA  player who still works in the league and asked not to be identified, “your per diem would be gone. God forbid it was a 10-day trip.”\n \n\n   \n  To understand how professional athletes are getting caught in the crosshairs of illegal gambling activity, it helps to understand their culture. Theirs is a world consumed by competition and hyper-competitive people who have disposable income and time on their hands.\n \n\n   \n  “It is,’’ said an NBA scout who asked not to be identified, “a perfect storm.’’\n \n\n   \n  Many fans shook their heads when details about two alleged gambling schemes broke in recent weeks. The first  resulted in the arrest  of a current NBA coach – Chauncey Billups, a Hall of Famer – and current player Terry Rozier. Billups is accused of allegedly conspiring with noted New York crime families to rig poker games and fleece unsuspecting participants out of thousands of dollars. Rozier allegedly intentionally tipped bettors off about his game participation, allowing them to profit off of prop bets that involved him.\n \n\n   \n   The second involved Cleveland Guardians  pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase. Both men are accused of allegedly working with co-conspirators to throw specific pitches in  Major League Baseball  games, coordinating with corrupt bettors to rig prop bets. The bets are alleged to have won $400,000 for bettors and Ortiz received $12,000 and Clase at least $60,000 for their roles in the scheme, according to the federal indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Why would players making hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, take part in an alleged gambling scheme that only amounted up to a fraction of their salary? Why take that risk?\n \n\n   \n  “The game fixing, the integrity of the game, that part makes no sense to me. None of it does,’’ one scout tells  CNN Sports . “And Chauncey Billups, he’s got millions. But I guess maybe he needs the action? That’s the thing. It’s kind of who they are, and now there are just so many outlets.’’\n \n\n   \n  Athletes’ hard wiring – their need to win at everything – is what makes them better than the rest of us mere mortals. Yet that same compulsion to compete, that adrenaline rush, is also what makes gambling so alluring.\n \n\n   \n  Rutgers University’s Center for Gambling Studies recently cross referenced 56 studies done on gambling and discovered that 78.9% of those studies concluded athletes gambled at higher rates than non athletes and 75% found that athletes were more likely to gamble than their non-athletic peers.\n \n\n   \n  “I can stop gambling,’’  Michael Jordan  told Connie Chung in a 1993 interview, when his own casino escapades came under scrutiny. “I have a competition problem, a competitive problem.’’\n \n\n   \n  This is not to say that all – or even most – athletes slip into the shady underworld uncovered in recent federal indictments or worse, shave points or fix games. Nor is it to excuse the behavior of those who have been accused.\n \n\n   \n  But for those who can’t comprehend how such a thing could occur, it helps to see just where the slippery slope might start.\n \n\n   \n  “These guys, they’re not going to sit around and read a f**king book,’’ the former scout said. “The game fixing? That surprises me, but the poker stuff? Not at all. You’re at a pre-game shootaround and someone says, ‘$100 I can make this shot.’ And they start at halfcourt, or three-quarters court. And they all get in.’’\n \n\n   \n    Cards and culture\n \n\n   \n  Card games have long been the pastime of the people who play America’s pastimes. Tony Kubek once told the Record of New Jersey about the 36-hour train rides he took with the New York Yankees in his MLB rookie season.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about poker games – $100 bills on the table and this was in an era when the good players were making $25,000,” he told the paper.\n \n\n   \n  Kubek made his debut in 1957.\n \n\n   \n  More than 20 years ago, long-time friends Charles Oakley and Tyrone Hill got into a beef over a gambling debt owed by Hill to Oakley, reportedly in the tens of thousands of dollars. Frustrated that he hadn’t been paid, Oakley, then with the Raptors, leveled a ball at Hill’s head during a pre-game shootaround between Toronto and the Philadelphia 76ers. Oakley got slapped with a $10,000 fine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hey you borrow money from the bank, they charge taxes,’’ Oakley later told  GQ   about the incident. “You don’t pay the IRS, they come and get you. So I had to come get him.’’\n \n\n   \n  Oakley and Hill’s spat went public; the bad blood stemming from the seemingly innocuous games was not, however, limited to just that pair. More than a few coaches, in fact, grew tired of the infighting and stopped the games – or the ones they knew about.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t really see them so much anymore,’’ a former NBA executive told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They drop $20,000 and they think nothing of it’\n \n\n   \n  But it is impossible to stop gambling. It is, for starters, legal for people older than 21 and permissible in every state save Utah and Hawaii. Sports gambling is permissible now in 38 states. All four major professional sports – the NHL,  NFL , MLB and NBA – have strict rules on betting on their own sports but only the NFL prohibits players from gambling while on the road in team hotels and from entering a sportsbook during the season. League rules also stipulate that coaches, staff and personnel cannot bet on any sports.\n \n\n   \n  And gambling is everywhere. Of the 27 cities that sponsor NBA franchises, 17 have casinos in or near their city’s downtown.\n \n\n   \n  “You ask any security guard,’’ the scout said. “Some of these guys, they go over to the casino and they drop $20,000 and think nothing of it. Because it’s not a lot to them. It’s not about the money. It’s about winning.’’\n \n\n   \n  The NBA Summer League is held in Las Vegas where it’s not unusual, the former exec says, to see players frequent the blackjack or craps tables on the Strip.\n \n\n   \n  “And we’re not talking the $10 tables,’’ he says. “We’re talking the big-money tables.’’\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the advent of online betting means no one even needs to leave their rooms.\n \n\n   \n  “Gambling, with DraftKings and FanDuel, it’s everywhere now,’’ says former Major League outfielder Jayson Werth. “It really is part of the culture.’’\n \n\n   \n    The hook of horse racing for a retired star\n \n\n   \n  A self-described “competitive junkie’’ who had to win in backyard Wiffleball games and pickup hoops, Werth felt the void of competition hit like a gut punch when he retired in 2018. Though he is quick to point out that he cannot comprehend how any professional athlete would engage in fixing games – “To try and lose? That isn’t even in the realm of possibility. You’re trying your best to win,’’ he told CNN Sports – he does understand what it’s like to feed the need to win.\n \n\n   \n  Werth tried the post-career life of leisure, signing up for pro-am  golf  tourneys. He dabbled in quirky investments, including organic racing, but nothing quite worked. He wasn’t lost but slightly unmoored.\n \n\n   \n  And then he went down to Tampa to visit a friend, Rich Averill. The two went to Tampa Downs to watch a race involving a horse that Averill owned. Standing on the rails, a very familiar adrenaline rush coursed through Werth.\n \n\n   \n  “I was hooked,’’ he said.\n \n\n   \n  He could have done it the easy way – studied the racing form and hit the windows – but Werth realized the difference was ownership. Being all in on the horse as a financial investor meant being personally invested.\n \n\n   \n  He partnered with some friends to form  Two Eight Racing  (he wore number 28 in his pro career) and set up immersing himself in the business of horse racing. He learned about bloodstocks, researched trainers and showed up regularly at the barn to meet and greet his own horses.\n \n\n   \n  He admittedly got a little lucky – his first big horse, Dornoch, won the Belmont Stakes and his second, Flying Mohawk, made last year’s Kentucky Derby field – but he realized he didn’t need to win to feel what he needed to feel.\n \n\n   \n  That led him to branch out to form Icon Racing, a horse racing syndicate that allows partial owners to experience full-time ownership. It’s open to everyone but Werth has personally tried to lure his fellow athletes.\n \n\n   \n  “I get it,’’ he said. “We need something. I played with guys who would bet you $100 if a penny was going to land on heads or tails. You’re raised to compete your whole life so that’s what you do. You compete.\n \n\n   \n  “But when it’s gone? It’s gone. I don’t think I realized how much of an itch that was until I couldn’t scratch it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/aca-subsidies-trump-obamacare-gop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Republicans Are Racing to Find a Plan for Enhanced ACA Subsidies","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the enhanced premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire in mid-December 2025, Republican lawmakers are racing to develop solutions to prevent a surge in health care premiums — which could rise by 114% — that would leave about 2 million Americans uninsured.

Here’s what they’re considering \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With less than six weeks before a key set of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies expire, congressional Republicans are  scrambling  to come up with a plan to address the pain of health care premiums skyrocketing for roughly 22 million Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Health care has long been a thorny issue for Republicans, and this time is no different. The caucus is divided, with some more moderate — and vulnerable — GOP lawmakers looking to temporarily extend the enhanced Obamacare subsidies with several changes. But others are following  President Donald Trump’s push  to send federal assistance directly to consumers, rather than health insurers.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the pressure is the looming mid-December vote in the Senate on extending the enhanced subsidies, which was a concession the several Democrats wrangled from GOP leaders in exchange for agreeing to end the record-long  federal government shutdown . However, it’s questionable if any plan — from either party — can win enough support to pass, and it’s not feasible to enact more substantive changes to the ACA subsidy structure before 2026 coverage begins.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, the  enhanced premium subsidies  made Obamacare policies more affordable — particularly for low-income consumers, who could find plans with $0 or near $0 monthly charges, and for the middle class, who became eligible for assistance for the first time. The beefed-up subsidies helped draw a  record 24 million people  to sign up for coverage this year, double the number that enrolled in 2020. And more than 90% of them receive premium assistance.\n \n\n   \n  If the enhanced subsidies lapse as scheduled, premiums are expected to soar 114%, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. A 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could have to pay $20,000 more annually for coverage. Roughly 2 million fewer people will be insured next year if the more generous assistance lapses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the enhanced subsidies would cost about $350 billion over the next decade\n \n\n   \n    Giving money to consumers\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump pushed the idea of sending subsidies directly to consumers, rather than to insurers, as is now the case in the Affordable Care Act.\n \n\n   \n  “THE MONEY MUST NOW GO DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE, TAKING THE “FAT CAT” INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE CORRUPT SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE,” Trump  posted on Truth Social  on November 8. “THE PEOPLE CAN BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER POLICY, FOR MUCH LESS MONEY, SAVING, FOR THEMSELVES, AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE!!!”\n \n\n   \n  At least two senators have jumped on Trump’s declaration, sketching out different ways of shifting federal funds to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Giving Americans more control over their health care spending is a longtime goal of many Republicans, said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+ and former health policy director for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. GOP lawmakers have long advocated for greater use of health savings accounts, or HSAs, which allow people to sock away money that can be used to pay for medical expenses tax free — though the funds typically can’t be used to pay for health insurance premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida is working on a bill that will give Americans funds “in HSA-style accounts and let them buy the health care they want. This will increase competition & drive down costs,” he  posted on X  in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Scott has not provided many details on his legislation but  told Fox News  on Sunday that people could use the funds to pay for premiums or co-pays. His proposal doesn’t seek to repeal Obamacare, but to fix it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, ideas like Trump’s and Scott’s could rock the Affordable Care Act and, potentially, lead to its withering or demise, experts say. That’s because people with fewer health care needs would likely use the funds to buy less comprehensive, less expensive coverage, leaving sicker, costlier enrollees in Obamacare policies and prompting insurers to raise premiums.\n \n\n   \n  “This would in a big way pull healthy people out of the ACA risk pool and likely lead to a premium death spiral and collapse of the ACA marketplaces,” said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy.\n \n\n   \n  An alternate plan promoted by GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana would direct the funds that would have been spent on the enhanced subsidies into flexible spending accounts that policyholders could use to shop for health care, which he argues would give patients incentives to find better prices. Cassidy is also open to the use of HSAs since the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill broadened eligibility to more ACA enrollees, a spokesman for the senator told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We empower patients to shop to find the best deal for their dollar that drives competition and that lowers cost,” Cassidy said in a speech on the Senate floor last week.\n \n\n   \n  Cassidy, who said on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that he is in communication with the White House about his plan, would retain the original Affordable Care Act subsidies, which were part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring.\n \n\n   \n  However, the complex US health care system is not designed for patients to shop for services, despite attempts by the first Trump administration to increase price transparency, experts said. It can be difficult for insured patients to know how much they would be responsible for when taking into account negotiated rates, deductibles and co-insurance. Plus, most spending is driven by sick patients who already have relationships with providers, and consolidation in the industry has decreased competition.\n \n\n   \n  “In theory, it seems like a good idea,” said Mona Shah, senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, which advocates for equitable health care. “The reality is even if that [price] information is accessible, how many people could navigate that, understand the differences, have the time to do that and then make informed decisions?”\n \n\n   \n  Also, giving consumers more control over the funds could actually put upward pressure on health care prices since they’ll have more money to spend on services, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n \n\n   \n    Extending the subsidies\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, there are efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the enhanced subsidies, which are formally known as premium tax credits, though some GOP lawmakers are advocating changes to the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  A bipartisan group of 30 House members  wrote a letter  Monday to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, urging them to include House lawmakers in the health reform discussions. Among the authors was Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Republican, who wants to extend the enhanced subsidies for a year to give Congress time to come up with an alternate plan.\n \n\n   \n  “As you know, those who rely on the expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) are facing drastic premium increases,” the representatives wrote. “Allowing these tax credits to lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”\n \n\n   \n  Another bipartisan House proposal calls for extending the enhanced subsidies for two years but placing an income cap on beefed-up assistance, phasing it out for those who make between $200,000 and $400,000 annually.\n \n\n   \n  Neither party wants “to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these [enhanced subsidies] expire with nothing in its place,” GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus who supports the effort, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday. “It can’t just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:46:00-18:00","title":"A new virus variant and lagging vaccinations may mean the US is in for a severe flu season","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is facing a potential severe flu season in 2025, driven by a new and mutated flu variant known as subclade K of the H3N2 strain.

\nUpdated: \n        7:46 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States may be heading into its second severe flu season in a row, driven by a mutated strain called subclade K that’s behind early surges in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter’s season was extreme, too.   The US had  its highest rates  of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least  280 children died of influenza , the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.\n \n\n   \n  Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.\n \n\n   \n    A new player\n \n\n   \n  Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the  latest FluView report  from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n \n\n   \n  That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on the a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the   predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n \n\n   \n  UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization   for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.\n \n\n   \n  But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a  recent preprint study , which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between   August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Flu vaccinations  have also fallen  in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus   this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with  more than 443,000 cases . Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.\n \n\n   \n  “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.\n \n\n   \n    ‘This is the time we start to see the rise’\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like   the severity is also worse,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.\n \n\n   \n  The company anonymously compiles its test results into a  syndromic surveillance tool , which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”\n \n\n   \n  Signals  are also rising  in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.\n \n\n   \n  “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.\n \n\n   \n  “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/air-traffic-controller-shortage-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"America is grappling with an air traffic controller shortage.

air traffic controller shortage. Can AI help? \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest  government shutdown  in US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands of  delayed or canceled flights .\n \n\n   \n  But even the  end of the shutdown  doesn’t fix the the broader  air traffic controller shortage  that’s been plaguing American flyers for years. Artificial intelligence, with its ability to analyze troves of data and potentially upend industries, might be able to help. After all, some in the field have called AI as impactful on everyday life as  electricity  or  fire. \n \n\n   \n  While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data on  weather patterns  or  aircraft trajectories , experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won’t be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a human system, and it’s human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.”\n \n\n   \n    Why AI won’t replace traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, described the job as demanding “unique skill and precision” in his  written testimony  for a hearing in March before the US House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. He called air traffic controllers the “backbone” of the National Airspace System, adding that they “require rigorous training, a mastery of complex systems, and the ability to perform under immense pressure.”\n \n\n   \n  That pressure is exactly why the job can’t be outsourced to AI, according to Sagun. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller’s voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it’s unclear whether AI can detect those cues.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added.\n \n\n   \n  There’s little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n \n\n   \n  And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn’t 100% reliable.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn’t be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the one thing that humans are very poor at doing — that very quickly, you lose vigilance, generally through boredom,” McCormick said.\n \n\n   \n    How AI could be helpful for air traffic controllers\n \n\n   \n  Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs.\n \n\n   \n  With many air traffic controllers  either retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown,  such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan  indicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation.\n \n\n   \n  Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developed  an AI system  for monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots.\n \n\n   \n  The technology is being used at London’s Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy.\n \n\n   \n  The company says on its website that the technology isn’t a replacement for human control. It’s seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backed   by infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA’s air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffy  said in May . But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffy  recently told reporters  at a press conference.\n \n\n   \n  “The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems. “We’re in initial stages. We’re not far down the road.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/what-we-know-epstein-files","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Urged Release of Epstein Files; House to Vote on Full Disclosure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Oversight Committee released 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, including emails showing Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell coordinating their responses to a lawsuit by accuser Virginia Giuffre, with references to Donald Trump.

Here’s what we know about them \n       \n  By Haven Orecchio-Egresitz, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday to force the release of records amassed by federal prosecutors during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice  Ghislaine Maxwell .\n \n\n   \n  The question of what is actually in those pages — and whether the public will ever see all of those documents — has become a headache for President Donald Trump and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  On November 12, the House Oversight Committee released  20,000 more pages  of records it received from Epstein’s estate, including emails in which Epstein insulted Trump and appeared to coordinate his response with Maxwell to a lawsuit brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The documents were released just hours before the swearing in of  Adelita Grijalva  as the House’s newest Democrat, which had been long delayed amid the government shutdown. Immediately after being sworn in, Grijalva became the decisive 218th member in support of the effort to force the House to vote on the release of this different set of documents — all of the Epstein documents that the Justice Department has access to.\n \n\n   \n  The vote is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but that alone won’t trigger the release of the documents. If the measure passes, it will still face an uncertain future in the Senate — even after Trump reversed his previous position Sunday and publicly urged for the release of the documents.\n \n\n   \n  At this point, though — six years after Epstein died in his New York prison cell — the public has gotten its hands on many records related to the disgraced financier and his alleged child sex trafficking ring.\n \n\n   \n  Some documents have come from the criminal trial and case file of Maxwell, Epstein’s onetime girlfriend. Some, like those in Wednesday’s release, came from Epstein’s estate, which provided the records to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Some of it, such as records that detail the physical and sexual abuse of women and girls, may never be released.\n \n\n   \n  The Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI’s main electronic case management system, “Sentinel.” These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division’s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI’s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of “302s,” which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews with investigators.\n \n\n   \n  The case has continued to fascinate the public, years after Epstein’s death, due to his ties to powerful people. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years — sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events — and all have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, after the most recent release of estate records Wednesday, announced he was asking Attorney General Pam Bondi  to investigate Epstein’s ties  to many other high-profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman — as well as the bank JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi later announced on X that  Jay Clayton , the US attorney in Manhattan, will lead the federal investigation.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether opening a new criminal investigation would prevent the release of the highly anticipated Justice Department records.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we do and don’t know about the Epstein records:\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department had asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\n \n\n   \n  The judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done. In August, two federal judges in New York  declined Justice Department requests  to unseal grand jury information in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Florida also denied DOJ’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn’t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\n \n\n   \n    Search warrants\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein’s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein’s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\n \n\n   \n  FBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\n \n\n   \n  They also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\n \n\n   \n  A search of Epstein’s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  In February the Justice Department provided an  index  of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island — that information has not been made public.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    Florida DOJ case file\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\n \n\n   \n    Civil lawsuits\n \n\n   \n  Much of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have  ordered  the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\n \n\n   \n  Among the famous names referenced in those  documents  are Trump, Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    Maxwell trial\n \n\n   \n  Maxwell’s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein’s former pilot  testified  and identified people he saw on Epstein’s plane, including Trump, former Sens. John Glenn and George Mitchell, Prince Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Gawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein’s so-called black book with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell’s criminal trial.\n \n\n   \n  The release was criticized by some of Trump’s supporters because the information was already public — and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\n \n\n   \n    The estate\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee released about 20,000 pages of documents it received from Epstein’s estate through a subpoena — materials the Department of Justice said it didn’t previously have access to.\n \n\n   \n  The documents included emails sent by Epstein. In one dated April 2, 2011, Epstein emailed Maxwell: “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. REDACTED spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned. police chief. etc. im 75 % there.” GOP members of the House Oversight Committee  identified  the person as Giuffre. In one January 2019 email, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff: “trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. . of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The emails also showed an apparent effort between Epstein and Maxwell to coordinate how they would respond to a lawsuit from Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday was the second time that the House Oversight Committee released documents from Epstein’s estate.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the committee put out a tranche of records, including a reported collection of birthday letters gifted to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The panel has been investigating the case and  had subpoenaed  the estate for documents as part of its probe.\n \n\n   \n  In a  social media exchange  last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that law enforcement did not have access to the estate documents at the time of his interview with Maxwell this summer.\n \n\n   \n   A version of this story originally published in July 2025.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-venezuela-strike-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00Z","title":"Trump hints at diplomatic window with Maduro but muses about hitting drug facilities in other countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has signaled openness to diplomatic talks with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, while simultaneously expressing willingness to conduct military strikes against drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia.

diplomatic window with Maduro but muses about hitting drug facilities in other countries \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:21 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has yet to make a decision on whether to attack  Venezuela  on land, a White House official and a senior US official said, as he hints a window may be opening for diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Monday he would be open to speaking directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a “certain time,” suggesting he sees a pathway in the country that doesn’t involve dropping bombs or sending commandos to take Maduro out.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, Trump made clear his willingness to go after drug operations on land using military force — including, he said, in Mexico and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “We know their address. We know their address. We know everything about every one of them,” he said of drug cartel leaders, adding he would be “proud” to strike drug facilities in other countries in his attempt to prevent the substances from reaching the United States.\n \n\n   \n  “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?” he said. “That’s OK with me.”\n \n\n   \n  As for Venezuela, Trump declined to rule out sending US troops, saying he doesn’t “rule out anything.”\n \n\n   \n  But as American military forces amass in the region — including the most advanced US aircraft carrier and 15,000 personnel — Trump is hoping the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, the US official said.\n \n\n   \n  “Yeah, I probably would talk to him,” Trump said Monday when asked whether he’d speak with his Venezuelan counterpart before ordering strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro suggested Monday night that he would be open to dialogue with his American counterpart.\n \n\n   \n  “Anyone who wants to talk to Venezuela will talk face to face,” Maduro said on state TV when asked to respond to Trump’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “We reaffirm that only through diplomacy should free countries and governments understand each other, and only through dialogue should they seek common ground on issues of mutual interest,” the Venezuelan leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Potential talks between Trump and Maduro are still very preliminary, a senior White House official told CNN. Maduro and his associates have reached out through multiple channels with a desire to open a line of communication.\n \n\n   \n  Even though Trump has expressed interest in he or his administration potentially holding those talks, it was not immediately clear who might be a part of those conversations. Initially, Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy, had been leading negotiations with top Venezuelan officials before Trump instructed him to end all diplomatic outreach last month.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s interest in potentially reopening diplomatic communications comes as the US military has continued to grow its presence near the South American country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump received briefings on military options on three consecutive days last week. The options ranged in intensity, from strikes on military or government facilities to special operations raids.

Critics say Prime Minister Georgia Meloni should do more to fix it \n       \n  By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:32 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Italian model and entrepreneur Pamela Genini had what many might consider an enviable life. The 29-year-old Milan resident was a successful real estate agent focused on high-commission seaside properties. A thriving influencer who was discovered on a popular reality TV program a decade earlier, she had just launched her own swimwear line with an influencer friend.\n \n\n   \n  In a country where the rate of unemployment and precarious employment for the under-30s is  stubbornly high ,  Genini had broken the mold.\n \n\n   \n  But one evening in mid-October, Genini’s 52-year-old ex-boyfriend Gianluca Soncin is alleged to have entered her apartment and fatally stabbed her. Police were called but arrived to find her dead on her balcony. Soncin was at her side, the investigating judge in the case said.\n \n\n   \n  Soncin, currently in solitary confinement awaiting formal charges, faces accusations of voluntary homicide, cruelty, stalking, and premeditation. His lawyer told CNN he had not yet answered any questions about what happened.\n \n\n   \n  Genini was the 72nd victim of femicide – usually defined as when a girl or woman is killed because of her gender, often by a current or former intimate partner – in Italy in 2025, according to the observatory group Non Una Di Meno (Not One Less), which keeps a tally of such killings. Four more women have been killed since Genini, according to the group, including Luciana Ronchi, 62, and 80-year-old Vanda Venditti. Six more cases are being examined as potential femicides.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, there were 116 cases of femicide, according to Non Una Di Meno, a slight decrease from the previous two years.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, Giorgia Meloni became Italy’s first female prime minister. Critics question whether she has  done enough  since to tackle increasing rates of violence against women in the country, or challenge persistent inequality in the workplace. Official figures show that birth rates dropped by 6.3% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and that some Italian women earn up to 40% less than men in the same jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Italy’s battle with femicide goes back decades. Meloni’s government has passed anti-stalking legislation tied to  previous femicides , and has made domestic violence an aggravating factor in sentencing, meaning those who are convicted in domestic violence cases now face longer prison terms for offenses, including life sentences in some cases.\n \n\n   \n  But many believe Meloni has not done as much in terms of prevention as they had expected.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s Education Ministry last week pushed forward a law that upholds the current ban on teaching sex education in kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, a curriculum  long seen by experts  as a precursor to educating young people about domestic violence and consent, with an eye to prevention.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni, who changed the name of the long-standing Ministry for Equal Opportunity to the Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities upon her election, has framed the continuing ban on sex education as a way to prevent the introduction of “woke gender theory” in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But opposition groups argue that denying young people exposure to basic sex education keeps the country grounded in its patriarchal past. “While Europe moves forward, Italy is returning to the Middle Ages,” opposition parliamentarian Alessandro Zan said last week.\n \n\n   \n  Meloni’s office declined CNN’s request for comment on the issue, but she has in the past denied being against advancing women’s interests. As a single mother who supports the traditional family, she has  insisted  that it is “ridiculous” to accuse her of not doing enough for women.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s fake news against me,” she said recently, in an address she posted on her TikTok account. She consistently points to her government’s pledge to expand parental rights and give tax breaks to families based on the number of children they have. The Ministry for the Family, Birth Rate and Equal Opportunities also declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Italy is one of the last European countries not to have compulsory sex education in the public school system, despite evidence  cited  by the United Nations that effective sex education offers an opportunity to teach about gender-based violence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the  potential for domestic violence  that makes being a woman in Italy feel so challenging. Parity indicators, which include employment and confidence in having a family, are increasingly dismal. In 2024, Italy’s already low birth rate fell once again, to 1.18, marking the 16th year in a row of steady decline,  according  to Italy’s ISTAT national statistical institute. Provisional figures for the first seven months of 2025 showed a further drop, to 1.13.\n \n\n   \n  Women are blamed for not having babies, including by Meloni, who has touted the traditional family and pushed forward legislation  criminalizing surrogacy  and allowing anti-abortion activists to access clinics. At an event in 2023, Meloni said too many young women were being pressured to focus on their careers first, and put off having children.\n \n\n   \n  Her critics say, however, that she has done little to help provide affordable child care options, despite campaign promises ahead of the 2022 election that launched her to power. Instead, proposed plans to build day-care centers were  slashed  from her first budget.\n \n\n   \n  The ISTAT fertility report identifies several factors in the declining birth rate, including an increasingly small pool of potential parents due to the lower number of babies born in the country since the 1970s. “Employment insecurity, particularly the prevalence of temporary work contracts, and low wages, also have a heavy impact on Italy’s falling birth rate,” the study says.\n \n\n   \n  Ariana Ricci, a 32-year-old human resources manager, voted for Meloni’s hard-right Brothers of Italy party in 2022, hoping she would prioritize efforts to tackle wage disparity, reproductive rights, and women’s safety. Ricci, who graduated from the prestigious Bocconi University in Milan, also studied overseas but says she wants to stay in Italy and be successful there, raise a family and own her own home.\n \n\n   \n  At the moment, however, she’s renting a room in a student apartment-share in Rome in order to avoid moving back in with her parents. She says she’s barely able to pay her rent and utility bills. She is easily employable on paper, but falls into the “precarious” job set, meaning no one will give her the coveted permanent contract, which comes with job security and ample benefits, but which research shows tends to be offered first to men.\n \n\n   \n  Ricci works on temporary contracts, which do not afford her job security, but have become an increasingly common way for companies to avoid paying generous benefits, especially mandatory maternity leave. Men are not granted paternity leave in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “If I were to start a family on a temporary contract, I wouldn’t get my maternity leave paid, I wouldn’t get my job back, and I couldn’t afford childcare even if I did have a job to go back to,” she said. “What incentive is that to have a family?”\n \n\n   \n  She had hoped a female leader would see the bind many young, employable women seem to be in. “I’m seeing a focus on international affairs instead,” she told CNN. “Meloni has made Italy look great abroad, but she has forgotten us here in Italy in many ways.”\n \n\n   \n  The World Economic Forum’s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report  ranks Italy 85th out of 148 countries on issues like economic participation and opportunity, education, health, and political empowerment.\n \n\n   \n  While Italy has risen two rankings since Meloni’s election, it remains among the lowest-placed countries in Europe for the overall gender gap. Notably, Italy fell to 117th place on women’s economic participation, dropping six points since the 2024 report.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s participation in Italy’s labor market has slumped in the past two years to a rate of 41.5% while men enjoy nearly 60% participation. And they earn up to 40% less than men in some sectors, according to the Global Gender Gap Report.\n \n\n   \n  Only 39% of management positions in Italy are held by women, and just 7% of Italian companies have female CEOs, according to  research  published last year by the Bocconi School of Management’s Executive Women Observatory.\n \n\n   \n  Elly Schlein, the leader of Italy’s main opposition Democratic Party, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Meloni government’s record on women’s issues.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on a TV program last week about new budget cuts proposed by Meloni’s government that are currently under debate in the Italian senate, Schlein said: “The hardest hit are women. When you cut welfare, schools, and funding for services for people with disabilities, the burden of care falls on families, and within families, on women.”\n \n\n   \n  But not all women agree. Beatrice Costa couldn’t be happier with Meloni as she sits at a coffee bar in central Rome, holding her six-month-old baby in her arms. Her three-year-old is around the corner in a state-run nursery school until lunchtime.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like I have permission to be a mother,” Costa told CNN, explaining that she had felt pressure growing up to have a career over family, or at least start her career first before thinking about becoming a mother. “The pressure not to have children is strong, the pressure to work outside the home, to give up the dream of having a family, to just get a dog instead, is hard to fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Costa, who has a university degree in communications, had already given birth to her first child when Meloni was elected. “I don’t know if we had a second child because of her focus on the traditional family, or if we would have anyway, but I’m glad I am empowered to be a mother,” she said, adding that her husband has a good job as a tax accountant and that they were given a home by her parents, who also help with childcare.\n \n\n   \n  “Some might say I have it easy, but I feel like I’m carrying out an Italian tradition and finally I have permission to do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/thailand-monkey-trafficking-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:01:00-05:00","title":"Monkeys, meth and mesh bags: Thai police arrest two for alleged animal trafficking","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thai police arrested two Thai nationals for allegedly smuggling 81 long-tailed macaques in blue mesh bags and methamphetamine near the Cambodian border.

methamphetamine, authorities said, in one of two cases that saw 143 monkeys rescued from suspected wildlife smugglers in a single day.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand is an international hub for wildlife trafficking, one of the world’s biggest illegal trades estimated to be worth between $7.8 and $10 billion per year,  according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n \n\n   \n  In the first case, rangers were patrolling in southeast Thailand’s Khlong Hat District, near the border with Cambodia, when they heard “unusual animal noises” coming from a sugarcane field, according to a press release from Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation (DNP).\n \n\n   \n  After checking the area, the authorities found 10 plastic baskets hidden in the sugarcane containing 62 long-tailed macaques, a monkey native to Southeast Asia   which is widely used in drug development because its DNA closely mirrors that of humans.\n \n\n   \n  There is also a thriving black market for the species, which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys – 44 males and 18 females – were bound inside blue nylon mesh bags, according to the press release.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys were in a weakened state and were transferred to a local wildlife rescue center.\n \n\n   \n  Later that afternoon, rangers were patrolling in neighboring Aranyaprathet District when they spotted two men unloading blue mesh bags from a pickup truck on a country road near the Cambodian border, the DNP said.\n \n\n   \n  After a car chase, police arrested two male suspects, who they identified as Thai nationals.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the car they found 81 long-tailed macaques – 30 males, 51 females – tightly packed in mesh bags, as well as methamphetamine, according to the release. The monkeys were also transferred to the wildlife rescue center for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  The suspects are facing offenses related to possessing and trading protected wildlife without permission, as well as charges for possessing and consuming illicit drugs, the DNP release said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a police statement, the suspects in the second case said they were hired to smuggle the monkeys into Cambodia.\n \n\n   \n  “The discovery of consecutive cases like this confirms that the border area remains a target for wildlife trafficking networks, especially for long-tailed macaques, which are in high demand internationally,” said Somruek Suppamitkrisana, Director of the Wildlife Conservation Division.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Thai police arrested a man after he was found with  two baby orangutans  in a basket at a gas station in Bangkok.\n \n\n   \n  Last November, Thailand repatriated home to Myanmar  almost 1,000 highly endangered tortoises and lemurs , which they recovered during an anti-trafficking operation.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024,  an endangered red panda  was found alongside 86 other animals inside luggage at Bangkok airport, bound for Mumbai, customs authorities said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/australia/australia-vegemite-prisoner-sues-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Murderer sues for right to eat Vegemite in Australian prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andre McKechnie, a convicted murderer who killed property developer Otto Kuhne in 1994, is suing the Victorian government and Corrections Victoria over a ban on Vegemite in prisons, claiming it violates his human right to 'enjoy his culture as an Australian' under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act. The ban, first introduced in 2006 due to concerns over drug concealment and alcohol production, has been a longstanding policy. McKechnie argues that the restriction breaches both cultural rights and the principle of adequate food for well-being.

He is suing Victoria’s Department of Justice and Community Safety and the agency that manages the prisons, Corrections Victoria. The case is scheduled for trial next year.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is seeking a court declaration that the defendants denied him his right under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to “enjoy his culture as an Australian.”\n \n\n   \n  He also wants a declaration that the defendants breached the Corrections Act by “failing to provide food adequate to maintain” McKechnie’s “well-being.”\n \n\n   \n  He wants the court to order the decision to ban Vegemite to be “remade in accordance with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite has been banned from Victorian prisons since 2006, with Corrections Victoria saying it “interferes with narcotic detection dogs.”\n \n\n   \n  Inmates used to smear packages of illicit drugs with Vegemite in the hope that the odor would distract the dogs from the contraband.\n \n\n   \n  Vegemite also contains yeast, which is banned from Victorian prisons because of its “potential to be used in the production of alcohol,” the contraband list says.\n \n\n   \n  Manufactured in Australia since 1923 as an alternative to Britain’s Marmite, Vegemite was long marketed as a source of vitamin B for growing children.\n \n\n   \n  The spread is beloved by a majority of Australians, but typically considered an acquired taste at best by those who weren’t raised on it.\n \n\n   \n  The last US president to visit Australia, Barack Obama, once said: “It’s horrible.”\n \n\n   \n  Australian band Men at Work aroused international curiosity about the yeast-based spread when they mentioned a “Vegemite sandwich” in their 1980s hit “Down Under.”\n \n\n   \n  The band’s lead singer Colin Hay once accused American critics of laying Vegemite on too thick, blaming a “more is more” US culture.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a favorite on breakfast toast and in cheese sandwiches, with most fans agreeing it’s best applied sparingly. Australian travelers bemoan Vegemite’s scarcity overseas.\n \n\n   \n  The Australian government intervened in April when Canadian officials temporarily prevented a Toronto-based cafe from selling Vegemite in jars and on toast in a dispute media branded as “Vegemite-gate.” Canadians relented and allowed the product to be sold despite its failure to comply with local regulations dealing with food packaging and vitamin fortification.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice and Community Safety and Corrections Victoria declined to comment on Tuesday. Government agencies generally maintain it is not appropriate to comment on issues that are before the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Victims of crime advocate and lawyer John Herron said it was a frivolous lawsuit and was offensive to victims’ families.\n \n\n   \n  “As victims, we don’t have any rights. We have limited if any support. It’s always about the perpetrator, and this just reinforces that,” said Herron, whose daughter Courtney Herron, was beaten to death in a Melbourne park in 2019. Her killer was found not guilty of murder by reason of mental impairment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a case of Vegemite or Nutella or whatever it may be. It’s an extra perk that is rubbing our faces in the tragedy that we’ve suffered,” Herron added.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie is currently held at maximum-security Port Phillip Prison. He was 23 years old when he stabbed to death wealthy Gold Coast property developer Otto Kuhne in Queensland state in 1994.\n \n\n   \n  He was sentenced to life for murder and transferred a decade later from the Queensland to the Victorian prison system.\n \n\n   \n  He wrote last year that he spent eight years free on parole in Victoria before he “decided that I had had enough.” He returned to prison and has spent the past decade in custody.\n \n\n   \n  McKechnie’s lawyers didn’t respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/china/china-lending-us-biggest-recipient-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:05:00-05:00","title":"In China’s global lending spree, the US has been the biggest beneficiary, study finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new report by AidData reveals that China has become the world’s largest official creditor through $2.2 trillion in overseas lending from 2000 to 2023, with the United States being the top recipient—receiving over $200 billion for nearly 2,500 projects.

In China’s global lending spree, the US has been the biggest beneficiary, study finds \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:05 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Washington has spent years warning countries about the dangers of accepting Chinese loans. But over the past two decades the United States has been the largest recipient globally.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the finding of a new report by AidData, a research lab at William & Mary university in Virginia, which has compiled the most expansive public database to date on China’s overseas lending activities.\n \n\n   \n  The findings, released Tuesday, reveal that government or majority state-owned Chinese entities loaned or granted $2.2 trillion of aid and credit spread across more than 200 countries between 2000 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  And at the top of that list of recipients is the US – a finding that the researchers say stands counter to a common assumption that Chinese financing has mainly poured into developing nations, for example under the auspices of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s flagship infrastructure drive the Belt and Road Initiative.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, more than three-quarters of China’s overseas lending operations now back projects and activities in upper-middle income and high-income countries, AidData found – and has been used on critical infrastructure, critical minerals, and the acquisition of high-tech assets critical to China’s national security goals.\n \n\n   \n  “The US and its allies in the wealthy, industrialized world have allowed Chinese state-owned creditors to finance critical infrastructure assets within their own jurisdictions. They’ve allowed them to finance the acquisition of critical minerals within their jurisdictional boundaries. They’ve allowed Chinese companies to use loans to buy their technological crown jewels,” AidData executive director Bradley Parks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the better part of the last decade, Washington has been warning countries that, in its view, Beijing is a predatory lender that will take control of another country’s assets if those loans fall into distress, Parks added.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s second largest economy has emerged as the world’s largest official creditor as it vied to position itself as the go-to financial ally for developing countries. Along the way it also came in for significant criticism that its practices saddled countries with unsustainable debt – a charge Beijing denies. Some  analysts  have also pushed back against the debt-trap narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the latest AidData shows that the US, as the top of the recipient of Chinese official sector financing, has received more than $200 billion for nearly 2,500 projects and activities that can be found in nearly every state in the country.\n \n\n   \n  More than half that credit was in the form of liquidity support to corporations, a kind of financing where Chinese creditors – often as one entity in a syndicate of many international financial institutions – act as a credit line for major companies that need cash.\n \n\n   \n  Such transactions are a common corporate practice and way for banks to make money – and they would not give Chinese firms a stake in companies or control over the borrowers, which have included Fortune 500 companies.\n \n\n   \n  But Chinese state-owned entities have also financed the acquisition of US high-tech companies and bankrolled infrastructure including LNG projects, energy pipelines, power transmission lines and airport terminals since 2000, the researchers found.\n \n\n   \n  Transactions involving sensitive sectors have become increasingly difficult in the US in recent years as regulatory scrutiny tightened amid growing concern in Washington about the national security implications of China’s financial stake in America. Chinese entities have looked to other high-income nations with less robust checks, AidData found.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom has received $60 billion and EU member states $161 billion over the 24-year study period, according to AidData.\n \n\n   \n  Like with the US, there has also been increased scrutiny and warnings in Britain and Europe over the levels of Chinese investment, particularly in critical infrastructure, in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not claiming and we don’t believe that all of this lending to the US serves some sort of grand geopolitical or geoeconomic strategy – some of it is really just about the pursuit of profit … China’s financial sector is just dominated by the state,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  However, he added, judging which transactions are “benign and (which) are not” constitutes a key challenge for regulators and national security officials.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Aligned with the policy’\n \n\n   \n  AidData researchers found “increasing alignment between China’s cross-border lending activities and the policy priorities of the party-state, including those related to national security and economic statecraft,” the team said in their report.\n \n\n   \n  In particular, the “Made In China 2025” initiative appeared linked to shifting priorities in outbound lending, according to the findings. The government plan, released in 2015, was meant to spur China’s development in advanced technologies, especially in high priority sectors that included robotics and automation, aerospace, and computing.\n \n\n   \n  “You see this rapid ramp up in cross-border acquisition lending that is aligned with that policy, and (Chinese entities) start lending for the 10 sectors that were that were identified in Made in China 2025,” said Parks.\n \n\n   \n  That enabled Chinese firms to acquire strategically significant assets using state capital to fill the gap in their own funds, according to Parks, who noted there is “no real analog” to that kind of practice in wealthy industrialized countries.\n \n\n   \n  Examples cited in the report of such high-tech company acquisitions in the US over the past two decades include semiconductor firm OmniVision Technologies, automation firm the Paslin Company and electronics company Ingram Micro, which was subsequently bought by an American private equity firm after the earlier acquisition.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state-owned creditors have also played a role in Beijing’s access around the world to critical minerals needed for high-tech goods, approving over 100 loan commitments worth $14 billion for overseas critical mineral operations between 2021 and 2023 globally.\n \n\n   \n  As Beijing focused on strategic sectors and its banks became creditors to wealthy Western firms, the overall share of overseas lending and grant-giving that supports low-income and lower-middle income countries has also fallen. Once accounting for some 88% of those activities in 2000, they now account for 24%, according to the findings.\n \n\n   \n  Another shift, according to Parks, has been how Western governments are looking at the Chinese government’s strategy.\n \n\n   \n  China’s rivals in the G7 are responding by making major adjustments that were once inconceivable—for example, slashing overseas development aid budgets, dismantling foreign aid agencies, ramping up cross-border lending on non-concessional terms, and taking equity stakes in critical infrastructure assets overseas, the report found.\n \n\n   \n  The US under the second Trump administration has imposed massive cuts to America’s international aid program, but there are efforts in Washington to vastly expand the budget of the US International Development Finance Corporation and its ability to disburse loans in high-income countries.\n \n\n   \n  Not long ago, according to Parks, “Beijing’s approach to international lending and grant-giving was a source of scorn or ridicule … it just was not a source of inspiration or emulation for policymakers in the G7, and now everything is turned upside down – now the US and its allies are really focused on competing with China on its terms.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/entertainment/wicked-for-good-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande","dateOfPublication":"1224-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00-04:00","title":"Ariana Grande Steps In to Support Cynthia Erivo on 'Wicked: For Good' Red Carpet After Voice Loss","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in 'Wicked: For Good,' lost her voice ahead of the New York premiere, prompting Ariana Grande, who plays Glinda, to step in and provide support during a live E! livestream interview with host Justin Sylvester.

They did, however, manage to stop by the  official E! livestream , where the pair popped in for a brief chat with host Justin Sylvester.\n \n\n   \n  Only Grande was handed a microphone to respond to his questions, noting at one point in reference to Erivo, who was standing right next to her: “I’m not letting her speak. She has to rest her voice!”\n \n\n   \n  As Erivo looked on smiling, Grande went on to comment on the pair’s joint Grammy nomination – they are  nominated for best pop duo/group performance  for “Defying Gravity” at next year’s music awards – as well as Erivo’s upcoming solo album and book titled “Simply More.”\n \n\n   \n  “Am I doing OK?” Grande asked Erivo jokingly as she plugged her costar’s projects. Erivo nodded, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  When they were asked about the emotions they’re feeling as the conclusion to  last year’s Oz-set film  approaches, Grande said she assumed they were experiencing the same thing – “overwhelming gratitude.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been such an incredible ride and an incredible experience to create with people we love so much and respect so much creatively, but also who just have such great hearts,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The “Yes, And” singer added that they are excited for the public to “finally be able to get the full story, the full arc of these women that we love so much, and have spent these years with.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Erivo leaned in to whisper something to Grande, but she had trouble hearing her. So Erivo briefly spoke into the mic in a raspy voice.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really beautiful that we’re finishing here, where it started,” she said, referencing New York City, which is home to the Gershwin theater, where the Tony-winning “Wicked” musical debuted in 2003 and is still playing on Broadway.\n \n\n   \n  The stars of the film have had an  action-packed  press tour to say the least.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, an Australian serial intruder who accosted Grande during the “Wicked: For Good” premiere in Singapore was sentenced to 9 days in jail for being a public nuisance.\n \n\n   \n  Grande and Erivo, who play Glinda and Elphaba, did not speak about the incident at the New York premiere, but Grande referenced the taxing press tour.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s only so much the human body can endure,” she said, assuring viewers that Erivo was “throat-coating.”\n \n\n   \n  “Wicked: For Good” flies into theaters on Friday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00.000Z","title":"Stocks and Bitcoin Slide as Nerves Fray Ahead of Nvidia Earnings","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wall Street opened on a negative note as stocks and bitcoin plunged amid rising investor fear, driven by anticipation of Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report and the delayed September jobs report.

sour note, with stocks and bitcoin tumbling as a risk-off attitude spread through markets.\n \n\n   \n  The Dow closed lower by 557 points, or 1.18%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  traded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks fell on Monday as investors’ nerves intensified ahead of two key events this week: Nvidia ( NVDA ), the star of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to report earnings on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.\n \n\n   \n  These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n \n\n   \n  Tech stocks have  come under pressure  this month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.\n \n\n   \n  Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon﻿ths, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 28% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Tech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase ( COIN ), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet. The 50-day moving average is a key threshold of support.\n \n\n   \n  “While the long-term uptrend is intact, we believe a corrective pullback/consolidation phase is already underway after the market’s six-month winning streak,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks are coming off a  volatile week . Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.\n \n\n   \n  “The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.\n \n\n   \n  “Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.\n \n\n   \n  “This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/asia/taiwan-handbook-china-invasion-disasters-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Taiwan rolls out handbook on how to prepare for natural disasters – and a Chinese invasion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Taiwan has released a comprehensive public handbook to prepare its 23 million residents for both natural disasters like typhoons and the potential military invasion by China.

gains for this year \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:58 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Bitcoin is in the red for the year — and investors say more  turbulence could be in store.\n \n\n   \n  Just six weeks after notching a record high above $126,000, bitcoin has plummeted more than 28%. The cryptocurrency on Monday  dipped below $90,000  for the first time in seven months, extending a slide that has erased all of its gains for this year.\n \n\n   \n  In Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market — when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n \n\n   \n  Investors in recent weeks have increasingly shunned risky assets like AI stocks and crypto. Not helping: uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin’s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,” said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, long-term bitcoin investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,” said Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since a  flash crash  on October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to intense fluctuations, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.\n \n\n   \n  “Bitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor — namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,” Chung said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Bitcoin’s roundtrip — for now\n \n\n   \n  Up until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency traded around $69,000 ahead of Trump’s reelection in November before surging about 83% — amid bouts of volatility — to its record-high above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin  surpassed $100,000  for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned into optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry, and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. The  GENIUS Act  was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation for  stablecoins , another kind of crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Trump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.\n \n\n   \n  Bitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. In comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 13.4% this year. Gold prices are up 53%.\n \n\n   \n  While tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia ( NVDA ) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $90,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in, and with increasing uncertainty about the outlook.\n \n\n   \n  “How the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,” Rafique at OKX said.\n \n\n   \n  Some crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,” said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. “But in our view it’s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/palestinian-prisoner-deaths-physicians-human-rights-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:08:00-04:00","title":"At least 98 Palestinians died in Israeli prisons in two years, Israeli human rights group finds","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) reveals that at least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, with the true number likely much higher due to missing persons from Gaza.

12:08 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, and the true death toll is likely higher given that a large number of people detained in Gaza are missing, according to a  new report  from an Israel-based human rights group, citing official Israeli data and other sources.\n \n\n   \n  The report by Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHRI) is based on official Israeli records and data obtained through freedom of information requests, which it cross-referenced with forensic reports, interviews with family members and lawyers, testimonies from detained Palestinians, information published by other human rights groups and other individual inquiries to locate specific detained persons.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinians died in custody from physical violence, medical neglect or both, according to PHRI, an Israeli advocacy group made up of medical professionals and human rights activists.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI found that 46 Palestinians died in the custody of the Israel Prison Service since the outbreak of the war and that at least 52 Palestinians — all from Gaza — died in Israeli military custody.\n \n\n   \n  “The fate of hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza detained by the Israeli military remains unknown to this day, suggesting that the true number of deaths is likely significantly higher than those documented here,” the PHRI report noted.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli authorities stopped providing information to the Red Cross regarding Palestinians in custody in the early days of the war and barred access to detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The last publicly available data that the Israeli military provided on deaths in detention was from May 2024, and the Israel Prison Service’s last provided data was from September 2024. After that, PHRI was able to document additional deaths using information from firsthand testimonies and official responses to requests submitted by the Palestinian Authority.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the allegations in the report, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) told CNN it “operates in accordance with the law” and that “all inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff.” It added that it does not comment on figures or allegations presented by outside organizations.\n \n\n   \n  “The claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented,” the IPS said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Unprecedented’ number of deaths\n \n\n   \n  “The unprecedented number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody over the past two years, together with clear evidence of deaths caused by torture and medical neglect, points to a deliberate Israeli policy of killing Palestinians while in detention,” Oneg Ben Dror, the project coordinator for PHRI’s prisoners and detainees department, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings — and the ongoing failure of Israeli law enforcement to prosecute those responsible — turn Israeli law itself into a fig leaf and a tool for concealment,” Ben Dror added.\n \n\n   \n  The report provides details on the deaths of Palestinians classified as “security prisoners,” which includes detainees held without charge or without trial.\n \n\n   \n  While the identities of some of those who died in Israeli custody remain unknown, the report identified 73 of the Palestinians who died. Those named in the report include  Dr. Adnan al-Bursh , 53, who was the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza and died after reported signs of “physical abuse” in prison, according to testimony from a fellow detainee who has since been released. The report also named 17-year-old  Walid Khalid Ahmad , who died following prolonged malnutrition, according to an autopsy report.\n \n\n   \n  PHRI concluded in the report that Israeli authorities have waged an “unprecedented assault on detained Palestinians,” arguing that Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, took steps to “deliberately worsen conditions of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Ministry of National Security for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Ben-Gvir previously advocated for the minimum conditions by law and said that “the conditions in prison add deterrence.” He also lashed out at the Israeli Supreme Court in September after it ruled that the state was not providing adequate food to Palestinian prisoners and must improve their nutrition.\n \n\n   \n  Deaths occurred at nearly all Israeli prison facilities, which the report said “further underscores the systematic and ongoing nature of these killings in Israeli custody.”\n \n\n   \n  Among those who died in Israeli prison facilities, 17 were from Gaza, 26 were from the occupied West Bank and three held Israeli citizenship, according to the report. The data shows that “on average, two Palestinians died every month in IPS detention facilities, with the number of deaths steadily increasing over time.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has  previously reported on abuse, medical neglect and horrific conditions  at the Sde Teiman field hospital at an Israeli military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel’s Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  The PHRI report found that from the start of the war through August of this year, 29 detained Palestinians from Gaza died at Sde Teiman in the custody of the Israeli military, and further deaths were recorded at military camps in southern Israel, Ofer and Anatot.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, PHRI announced it was joining leading Israeli  human rights group B’Tselem  in calling Israel’s actions in Gaza genocide. Israel has strongly rejected the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/trump-mcdonalds-economy-tariffs-rebate-checks-inflation-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump promoted a narrative of an economic 'golden age' during a speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, citing lower inflation and affordability.

Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  He went on, “We are looking at affordability — we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,” including 401Ks.\n \n\n   \n  Citizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they’ve also been punished  by daily costs  and the money in their paychecks  not going as far . And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidate  now in question . Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy — punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald’s in American communities. “Before the sun rises, you’re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There’s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it’s Americana.”\n \n\n   \n  This was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn’t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents’ branding on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The word is affordable,” Trump said. “And affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said ‘affordability, affordability’ and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats in  gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey  this month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.\n \n\n   \n  First, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for most  food ,  housing  and  health care  that are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.\n \n\n   \n  While inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% — far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration — costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation — that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn’t make it feel any easier.\n \n\n   \n  And after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability — and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s lack of answers on those issues — Trump is now suffering the incumbent’s curse. He’s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren’t feeling better, so he’s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.\n \n\n   \n  The statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. “(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who’d prefer the buck didn’t stop with him.\n \n\n   \n    How Trump is trying to ease costs\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He’s trying to bring down the cost of  prescription drugs . He temporarily eliminated  tax on most tips  in his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.\n \n\n   \n  But insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can’t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  It’s going to need more than Trump’s first big political point in his Monday speech: “You are so damn lucky that I won that election.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars and  high tariffs  are contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year.   A  CNN poll this month  found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  Alleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump’s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out  $2000 tariff revenue payments  is one idea — though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn’t fix the damage and added “who knows if they’ll ever come.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials are thinking aloud about  50-year mortgages . This might get people into homes — if there’s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.\n \n\n   \n    Tariffs may be the problem\n \n\n   \n  More fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Friday  cutting duties  on beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” Hassett said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday, said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday. But he added, “The prices will go down,” arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump isn’t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy — which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That’s time Trump doesn’t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.\n \n\n   \n  And the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. “I blew my stack at these people,”  he told a reporter .\n \n\n   \n  Another complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into a  complete reversal  by calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.\n \n\n   \n  Even one of his top supporters,  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a “golden age” when they know well that it is not won’t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the new  White House ballroom , dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn’t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And his speech at the McDonald’s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword “affordability” a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, as  CNN’s Daniel Dale has documented .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn’t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  But his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he’s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking about  sending him around the country  to give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he’d given a McDonald’s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. “‘I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don’t care.’ But I don’t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren’t too accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  And one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. “I like the fish. I like it,” Trump said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/stand-your-ground-laws-limits-states","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Indiana fatal shooting renews questions about stand-your-ground laws and their limits","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The fatal shooting of Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez in Indiana, after she mistakenly arrived at the wrong home, has reignited national debates over the scope and limits of stand-your-ground laws.

fatal shooting renews questions about stand-your-ground laws and their limits. Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez’s mistaken arrival at the wrong Indiana address Wednesday  cost her her life . As the house cleaner tried to enter the home she thought was scheduled for housekeeping that morning, the homeowner fatally shot her.\n \n\n   \n  The incident is renewing questions about so-called stand-your-ground laws that can empower individuals to defend themselves, even with deadly force, if they feel threatened or in danger. But the statutes are very specific and the extent of their protection varies by state.\n \n\n   \n  Under  Indiana law , individuals may use reasonable force — including deadly force — to stop a person from unlawfully trying to enter their property. But  prosecutors say  the statute doesn’t apply to the homeowner’s actions Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about stand-your-ground laws.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground laws can empower homeowners against intruders\n \n\n   \n  Generally, stand-your-ground laws and “castle doctrines” can allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n \n\n   \n  The “castle doctrine” is the legal notion that your home is your castle, and you have the right to use lethal force to defend your home and not retreat. A number of states have enshrined the castle doctrine in statutory law, sometimes with slightly different guidelines for when deadly force can be used.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, stand-your-ground laws and policies say even when a person is outside their home, they can stay where they are without retreating, even if they can avoid the danger by retreating, according to University of California, Los Angeles, law professor Eugene Volokh.\n \n\n   \n  These statutes deal with a very specific question, according to Volokh: If someone reasonably fears death, serious bodily injury, etc., but can avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating, can that person still stay where they are and use deadly force?\n \n\n   \n  “They allow people to respond to threats of death, serious bodily injury, rape, and some other serious crimes with deadly force,” Volokh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, you “generally can’t use deadly force for self-defense in most states unless you reasonably believe that you’re facing the risk of death or serious bodily injury or some serious crime: rape, kidnapping or, in some states, robbery, burglary, or arson,”  Volokh previously wrote  on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the laws, including the National Rifle Association, say they give people the right to protect themselves, no matter where they are. Critics say the laws encourage violence and allow for  legal racial bias .\n \n\n   \n    Most states have some version of the self-defense laws\n \n\n   \n  The count of states with stand-your-ground doctrines depends on the criteria used to define them, because states word and even enforce the statutes differently.\n \n\n   \n  At least 31 states, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands recognize that “there is no duty to retreat in any place in which one is lawfully present or has the right to be,” according to the  National Conference of State Legislatures . Arkansas and Ohio became the latest states to enact the legislation in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In eight states — California, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia, Vermont and Washington — that don’t have stand-your-ground laws, courts and jury instructions can allow people to use deadly force to defend themselves if they believe they are in serious danger, according to the NCSL.\n \n\n   \n  At least 23 states have laws to protect people from being sued for damages by the person they defended themselves against, the NCSL says. Six states tip the scales in the other direction, allowing even a person who wasn’t charged with a crime or found to have acted in self-defense to be sued in civil court: Hawaii, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Tennessee.\n \n\n   \n  The law has long been used in legal battles across the country\n \n\n   \n  In Florida, where the first stand-your-ground law was passed in 2005, it was used in the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who fatally shot  17-year-old Trayvon Martin  in 2012 while he was walking home from a convenience store. Zimmerman’s supporters said he was exercising his Second Amendment right to bear arms and  Florida’s stand-your-ground law  gave him immunity.\n \n\n   \n  Florida’s law allows people to meet “force with force” if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else.\n \n\n   \n  In Texas,  jurors were allowed to consider  the “castle doctrine” in the 2018 murder case against Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who said she mistakenly entered the wrong apartment and killed Botham Jean, a 26-year-old man. In October 2019, a jury ultimately found  Guyger guilty of murdering  Jean and sentenced her to 10 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  And more recently in Texas, after an 11-year-old playing “ding-dong-ditch” was  fatally shot as he ran  from a home whose doorbell he playfully rang in August, prosecutors were quick to deny that the state’s self-defense legislation was relevant. “The castle doctrine does not apply in any way, shape or form to an 11-year-old boy running down the street,” police previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Texas law says a person can use force as a means of self-defense if they reasonably believe the force is immediately necessary to protect them against another’s use or attempted use of force. The state has “one of the strongest ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws,”  according to  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/james-comey-indictment-tainted-judge-halligan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:18:00-05:00","title":"Judge Says James Comey Indictment May Be Tainted by ‘Profound Investigative Missteps’","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, William Fitzpatrick, has ruled that the Justice Department committed 'profound investigative missteps' in its case against former FBI Director James Comey, including accessing private, attorney-client communications from Daniel Richman’s online accounts without a new search warrant or proper exclusion.

indictment may be tainted by ‘profound investigative missteps’ \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:18 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge on Monday scorched the Justice Department’s handling of years-old evidence in its case against former FBI Director James Comey, raising the possibility that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan may have botched the grand jury proceeding and the indictment could be tainted.\n \n\n   \n  “The record points to a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps, missteps that led an FBI agent and a prosecutor to potentially undermine the integrity of the grand jury proceeding,” Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote  in an opinion  released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick’s finding that Comey’s rights may have been violated with the use of the evidence collected in another investigation more than five years ago sets the table for Comey’s team to make a more robust challenge of the indictment and ask the court to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also has raised the stakes for Comey’s potential access to transcripts of Halligan speaking to the grand jury in late September before they approved the indictment. The judge said that Halligan – the only prosecutor to present the case on behalf of the Justice Department – may have misstated the law to the grand jurors in a way that compromised the proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “Here, the procedural and substantive irregularities that occurred before the grand jury, and the manner in which evidence presented to the grand jury was collected and used, may rise to the level of government misconduct resulting in prejudice to Mr. Comey,” the judge wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Access to evidence from a previous investigation\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick said the Justice Department accessed old evidence it seized in searches of online accounts from Comey’s friend and then-lawyer Daniel Richman, for a prior leak investigation that didn’t result in charges.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said DOJ did so without a new court-approved search warrant. Nor did investigators take time this year to sift out confidential attorney-client communications when it charged Comey at the end of September, knowing some of that evidence might not be able to be used, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This cavalier attitude towards a basic tenet of the Fourth Amendment and multiple court orders left the government unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized” from the prior investigation of Richman, Fitzpatrick wrote, “and apparently, in the government’s eyes, to do so again anytime they chose.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge had said Comey’s defense team should get access to the grand jury records on Monday, but the Justice Department is still trying to challenge that decision and is holding back the records as another trial-court judge looks at the issues. The Justice Department said in a filing on Monday following Fitzpatrick’s ruling that Comey’s attorney-client confidentiality may not even have been breached by investigators, and that Comey shouldn’t be able to reach beyond grand jury secrecy rules at this point of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The court could move fast to resolve the dispute over whether Comey’s team gets access to the grand jury records as soon as this weekend, with little additional ability in a criminal proceeding.\n \n\n   \n  “These materials are essential if Mr. Comey is to fully and fairly defend himself in the face of the irregularities that have characterized this investigation from its inception,” Fitzpatrick wrote on Monday. “The Court finds that the institutional concerns for grand jury secrecy are greatly outweighed by Mr. Comey’s right to Due Process.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge called the Justice Department’s decision this fall not to seek a new search warrant that would have been court approved to access the old evidence from Richman “inexplicable” and “highly unusual.” He also noted that it was “foreseeable” Richman’s electronic devices might contain attorney-client communications with Comey, and the department had known this for years, even excluding Comey from its evidence processing years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Later Monday evening, Fitzpatrick’s order that would allow Comey’s defense team to access grand jury records was temporarily paused by the federal judge overseeing the entire case.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have until Wednesday to make their argument over court filings to why the order should be dissolved, the federal judge said. Comey’s attorneys will then have until Friday to reply to the objections prosecutors raise.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzpatrick also revealed for the first time that an agent had warned others at the FBI about the use of Richman’s data on the same day Comey was indicted in September — just a few days before the window in which the department could bring a case would close.\n \n\n   \n  One of the FBI agents who had been warned of potentially tainted evidence, the judge said, still “proceeded into the grand jury undeterred,” testifying to the grand jurors as the only witness, about evidence from the old searches of Richman.\n \n\n   \n    Grand jury presentation\n \n\n   \n  The judge also slammed statements Halligan made to the grand jury, adding that the prosecutor appears to have made a “fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law” regarding Comey’s ability to testify at his own trial and about his legal burdens if he were charged. The exact words Halligan said to the grand jury are redacted in the judge’s opinion on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  But Fitzpatrick, who has read the grand jury transcript, said grand jurors seemed to believe Halligan was telling them that Comey would have to answer questions at trial that she couldn’t during the proceeding, where prosecutors privately present the case to the grand jurors. The judge said Halligan implied to the grand jury that Comey may have to testify at his own trial to win his case — even though the Fifth Amendment gives defendants the protection to decline to testify so as not to incriminate themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the judge noted that Halligan suggested to the grand jury the Justice Department had more and better evidence it could use against Comey later at trial, another potentially problematic statement by the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s team will be able to ask the court to suppress the use of core evidence in his case or to dismiss charges against him - including because of what Halligan and the FBI agent witness said to the grand jurors by next week.\n \n\n   \n  The case, alleging Comey lied to Congress in 2020 about his interactions with Richman, currently is set to go to trial just after New Year’s Day. A separate judge is weighing whether Halligan has the authority to have secured the indictment against Comey, given that she is not a Senate-confirmed political appointee.\n \n\n   \n    Timing of grand jury hearing\n \n\n   \n  The magistrate judge also raised significant questions about the timing of the grand jury deliberations and two hours for which there is no grand jury transcript, which Halligan has outlined in a sworn statement recently and said tracked with the grand jury’s deliberations, which wouldn’t have been recorded.\n \n\n   \n  “If the prosecutor is mistaken about the time she received notification of the grand jury’s vote on the original indictment, and this procedure did take place, then the transcript and audio recording provided to the Court are incomplete,” Fitzpatrick also wrote. “If this procedure did not take place, then the Court is in uncharted legal territory in that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”\n \n\n   \n  “Either way, this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment,” Fitzpatrick added.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/fema-chief-david-richardson-steps-down","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"FEMA chief steps down as Trump administration prepared to oust him","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Richardson, the acting chief of FEMA, has stepped down after months of controversy and internal frustration, with plans already in motion to oust him before hurricane season ended.

Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:06 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The embattled acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will step down after hurricane season following months of public controversy and internal frustration.\n \n\n   \n  David Richardson submitted a resignation letter on Monday to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, giving two weeks’ notice, the department told CNN. However, plans were already in the works at the agency to oust him from the role, three sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson, a loyalist to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, was tapped to lead FEMA even though he lacked experience in disaster management. But his time in charge has been punctuated by some eyebrow-raising moments — like in a June meeting in which he told staff he  was unaware the US has a hurricane season,  a comment DHS later insisted was a joke.\n \n\n   \n  His impending departure raises the stakes for FEMA — the agency responsible for helping Americans recover from the nation’s worst disasters — as Noem and DHS prepare for sweeping reforms that could fundamentally reshape its future.\n \n\n   \n  A FEMA official with knowledge of the decision said Karen Evans, a close Trump administration ally at DHS and FEMA’s newly appointed chief of staff, will replace Richardson.   A DHS spokesperson later said in a statement that Evans will will start in her new role on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson said the agencies thanked Richardson “for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s leadership faced its toughest test in July, when  catastrophic floods devastated Texas  and killed more than 130 people. As the crisis unfolded, Richardson was on vacation and unreachable for hours. He later told lawmakers he spent the entire trip in his truck, glued to his phone, coordinating the response.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Richardson was publicly silent and absent from the flood zone, surfacing more than a week later for an unannounced visit to Texas — days after President Donald Trump and Noem toured the area. He arrived in a straw hat and cowboy boots, notably lacking any FEMA insignia — a striking departure from the typical image of agency leaders on the front lines of a crisis.\n \n\n   \n  His absence was not by chance. DHS leaders had instructed FEMA to keep Richardson’s Texas trip under wraps until he left the state, deliberately shielding him from the press, three sources with knowledge of the decision said.\n \n\n   \n  Richardson later defended his leadership and told lawmakers the DHS response in Texas was a “model for how to respond to a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n  Traditionally, the FEMA administrator is the president’s right hand for natural disasters and national emergencies. But in Trump’s second term, Richardson has been largely pushed to the sidelines, with his authority steadily diminished by Noem.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Monday, Richardson defended his short tenure at FEMA, arguing that he “didn’t hesitate” to take on the leadership post just weeks before hurricane season began.\n \n\n   \n  “I agreed to be the acting administrator through hurricane season when others wouldn’t. Hurricane season ends on 1 December. Since the danger has largely passed, I can now leave for other opportunities,” he said. “Many were asked. One raised his hand and said, ‘I’ll do it.’”\n \n\n   \n    Criticism of Richardson’s leadership at FEMA\n \n\n   \n  A former Marine combat veteran, martial arts instructor and  painter,  Richardson previously led the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office at DHS but had no experience managing natural disasters when he was tapped for the FEMA role in May.  His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, also a Trump administration appointee, was fired  for clashing with senior homeland security officials and opposing the administration’s push to eliminate FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  “He never should have been there to begin with,” Hamilton, who worked with Richardson during his time in the administration, told CNN this week. “The two words I’d use to describe him are unprofessional and overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson’s appointment marked a turning point as DHS tightened its grip on FEMA, installing loyalists in key positions and pushing out veteran disaster experts. Unlike Hamilton, Richardson was seen as someone who would follow orders. He’s a personal friend of longtime Trump ally  Corey Lewandowski, who is helping Noem run DHS  as her chief adviser.\n \n\n   \n  On his first day, Richardson told FEMA staff he alone spoke for the agency and warned he would “run right over” anyone who didn’t fall in line.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials describe his leadership as brash and unpredictable, with a penchant for shouting and swearing. On one occasion, he asked staff whether disaster funds could be steered to Republican areas but not Democratic ones, a FEMA official who heard the comments firsthand said.\n \n\n   \n  At times, Richardson prohibited staff from bringing cell phones and computers into meetings. He often kept his own phone out of sight and rarely used email, leaving senior FEMA leaders struggling to reach him and making even basic communication a constant challenge.\n \n\n   \n  Over the months, Noem and her team had grown frustrated with Richardson’s distracting antics and failure to effectively communicate their FEMA reforms to Congress and the public, three sources with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. But senior leaders ultimately decided it made more sense to wait until after hurricane season to remove him.\n \n\n   \n  The department has steadily reduced his role, treating him more as a liability than an asset. DHS has repeatedly blocked his requests to speak at conventions or to lead public information campaigns about hurricane season, two sources said.\n \n\n   \n  “Have you heard him speak?” an administration official told CNN. “He does more damage than good.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, the department has reassigned some of Richardson’s closest allies and surrounded him with senior staff who have further limited his authority.\n \n\n   \n    FEMA’s future at a crossroads\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Richardson’s removal is significant. Once hurricane season ends at the end of the month, the administration is set to fast-track its sweeping transformation of FEMA.\n \n\n   \n  The new FEMA Review Council, which is headed by Noem, will soon deliver its much-anticipated report, outlining recommendations to reshape the agency. As the dust settles, FEMA’s future — and its ability to respond when disaster strikes — hangs in the balance.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, dozens of lawmakers have signed on to a bipartisan bill known as the “FEMA Act” that would remove the agency from DHS and make it independent — a change Noem vehemently opposes, multiple sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Noem have been  overhauling FEMA since taking office  as they vow to shift more responsibility for disaster preparedness, response and recovery onto states. While they once called for the agency’s outright elimination, their tone has shifted in recent months, signaling a dramatic restructuring may be in store. Either way, current and former high-ranking FEMA officials have  warned that growing turmoil at the agency is putting Americans at risk .\n \n\n   \n  More than a quarter of the agency’s full-time staff have left through layoffs and buyouts — including dozens of longtime senior leaders — and morale has plummeted amid frequent public attacks from administration officials, including Noem and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration has benefited from the mildest hurricane season in a decade, with no hurricanes making landfall anywhere in the US for the first time since 2015.\n \n\n   \n  “FEMA likely would have failed had there been a major disaster,” a former high-ranking FEMA official told CNN. “Having no big disasters has absolutely played into the Trump narrative that there is no need for FEMA. And it hasn’t allowed the American people to see just how bad they need the agency, since the states just aren’t prepared.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-cleveland-shedeur-sanders-home-break-in","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Cleveland rookie Shedeur Sanders’ home broken into during NFL debut, AP source says","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns’ rookie quarterback, experienced a home break-in during his NFL debut against the Baltimore Ravens on November 17, 2025, while he was playing in the game.

Larry Summers says he is ‘deeply ashamed’ after new Jeffrey Epstein emails and will pause public engagements \n       \n  By MJ Lee, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:09 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Larry Summers said Monday night that he was “deeply ashamed” about his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, telling CNN that he would pause all public engagements as he works to “rebuild trust and repair relationships” — but the Harvard University professor added that he will continue teaching as some call for the university to sever ties with him.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said. “While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.”\n \n\n   \n  New details of Summers’ relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee  released emails  showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein’s romantic advice.\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ first statement addressing the newly unveiled Epstein correspondence comes on the heels of Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling on Harvard to sever ties with Summers and putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, had said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers — Harvard’s former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein’s sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation’s politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvard has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning think tank where Summers has been a senior fellow, said Monday night after Summers’ statement: “Larry Summers has announced that he is stepping away from public commitments immediately, and this includes ending his fellowship at CAP.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers served as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country’s most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has  clashed   with Summers   over financial regulations  in the past.\n \n\n   \n  But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represented an even sharper critique of his character.\n \n\n   \n  Summers resigned as Harvard’s president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He  currently serves  as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.\n \n\n   \n  The House Oversight Committee released  tens of thousands of pages  of documents on Wednesday that it received from the Epstein estate. Included in the recent trove were numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein between at least 2013 and 2019. Epstein  pleaded guilty  in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.\n \n\n   \n  The messages show the two men frequently bantered about current events, political headlines and high-profile figures in elite orbits — everything from Iran’s nuclear policy to Donald Trump’s first-term decisions in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers’ romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.\n \n\n   \n  In November 2018, for example, Summers seemed to forward an email from a woman to solicit Epstein’s advice on when to write back.\n \n\n   \n  “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. (He happened to ask in the same email whether Epstein believed Trump was “getting crazier” or was “steady crazy.”)\n \n\n   \n  Epstein wrote back in part: “she’s already beginning to sound needy :) nice.”\n \n\n   \n  In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers’ continued contact with Epstein  during this period  was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an  exhaustive investigative series  detailing Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges.\n \n\n   \n  Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers.\n \n\n   \n  “Why bad form. Supposed to be face to face?” Summers wrote back.\n \n\n   \n  “you care very much for this person. You might want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite,” Epstein wrote back, before appearing to compare the situation to Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”\n \n\n   \n  Summers’ wife, Elisa New, is a  professor emerita  of American literature at Harvard. The Wall Street Journal  previously reported  that Summers had asked Epstein to donate money to his wife’s nonprofit. The school’s student paper, The Harvard Crimson,  reported on the outrage  among some professors about the emails between Summers and Epstein. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which included numerous comments and discussions about the president, that he is  asking his attorney general , Pam Bondi, to investigate Epstein’s ties to high-profile figures and institutions. Among those Trump singled out were Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.\n \n\n   \n  The Economic Club of New York announced Monday that it postponed an upcoming event featuring Summers, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The  virtual event , scheduled for Wednesday, was billed as a discussion about “the future of fiscal and monetary policy,” with Summers and an economics professor from Columbia University. But the club said in an email to registered attendees that there had been an “unavoidable change in schedule,” spurring the postponement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN if the postponement was influenced by the Epstein revelations, a club spokeswoman reiterated that it was “due to an unavoidable change in schedule.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/football-nfl-bengals-chase-suspended-spitting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:16:00-05:00","title":"Bengals receiver Ja’Marr Chase suspended 1 game by NFL for spitting on Steelers’ Jalen Ramsey","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase was suspended one game without pay by the NFL for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey during a game on November 16, 2025.

Kristen Holmes, Alayna Treene, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:43 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  is planning to receive Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman  at the White House on Tuesday with all the trappings of a state visit, sources familiar with the matter said, including a welcome ceremony in the morning and a formal dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re more than meeting,” Trump said late Friday as he flew to Florida for the weekend. “We’re honoring Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince.”\n \n\n   \n  While the White House has decided to pull out all the stops, the visit cannot be classified as an official state visit as Prince bin Salman is not Saudi Arabia’s head of state. That position is occupied by his 89-year-old father,  King Salman . But the crown prince has assumed almost all day-to-day responsibility for ruling the kingdom, and attends summits and other diplomatic engagements as the country’s leader.\n \n\n   \n  On the eve of Prince bin Salman’s first  visit to the White House  in more than seven years, Trump announced that the US would be selling  F-35 fighter jets  to Saudi Arabia — a controversial step that could alter the military balance in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve been a great ally,” Trump told reporters. “I will say that we will be doing that. We’ll be selling F-35s.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has worked to cultivate a close relationship with the kingdom’s de facto ruler in the hopes he will decide to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, which would be a major advancement of the president’s signature  Abraham Accords  — a longtime goal of the president’s.\n \n\n   \n  “The Abraham Accords will be a part we’re going to be discussing,” Trump said Friday. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.”\n \n\n   \n  The prince last visited Washington in 2018, months before the murder of dissident journalist  Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate  in Turkey. A CIA assessment released afterward found the prince had likely ordered the assassination, though he has long denied any involvement. Hanan Elatr Khashoggi,  Khashoggi’s widow , told CNN’s Jim Sciutto of the planned White House meeting: “It’s very painful for me. It will be better if Jamal was here and receiving the crown prince by himself and meet with him and share with him his vision and mission, and all of his ideas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump never entirely cut off ties with the crown prince during his first term, though he wasn’t invited back to the White House. Even Trump’s successor President Joe Biden, who vowed as a candidate to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights record, visited Riyadh while in office and fist bumped Prince bin Salman.\n \n\n   \n  With Tuesday’s visit, any semblance of a rupture in  US-Saudi ties  appears to have disappeared. The plans include a welcome ceremony involving military bands, a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office and a black-tie dinner in the evening.\n \n\n   \n  The first tranche of invitations were sent out earlier this month and the guest list includes largely chief executives, as well as lawmakers and governors — some of whom Trump himself called to invite to the dinner, people familiar with the plans said. The event is being coordinated by first lady Melania Trump, as all state visits are planned through the first lady’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has yet to hold a state visit in his second term, which is typically put on as a sign of friendship and to display the close relationship the US shares with its allies, during his second term. Trump broke with tradition during his first administration by opting not to hold a state dinner during his first year in office, though he went on to host the president of France and prime minister of Australia in 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit,” a White House official said in a statement to CNN. “We will not get ahead of the President on conversations that are occurring ahead of time.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia is also planning an investment summit to coincide with the crown prince’s trip to Washington. The event at the Kennedy Center, a day after the White House visit, is intended to link up American and Saudi business leaders for financial opportunities.\n \n\n   \n  In May, Trump visited Saudi Arabia for the first state visit of his second term and was welcomed with  elaborate pageantry , including a fighter jet escort, an honor guard with golden swords and a fleet of Arabian horses accompanying his limousine. The president has sought to deepen ties to other Gulf states during his tenure, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n \n\n   \n  Before the May stop, Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the United States. Trump brought several American executives with him to Riyadh, and signed several agreements. Many have yet to be fully implemented.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s meetings, US and Saudi officials were working to finalize agreements on defense and security cooperation, a US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Riyadh has long sought the F-35s, one of the most advanced military jets in the world. But Israel — the only country in the Middle East with the jets — is worried about maintaining its military edge. Congress could block export licenses for the F-35s to Saudi Arabia, though it’s unusual.\n \n\n   \n    Discussions about normalizing relations with Israel\n \n\n   \n  Atop Trump’s agenda will be a discussion of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, a step he believes is within reach after he helped broker a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The October 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel, and the war that followed, largely put on hold the normalization discussions that began during Trump’s first term and advanced during Biden’s. A framework being discussed before the attacks would include a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia and help building a civilian nuclear program in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Biden and many of his top aides have said they believe the October 7 attack was intended, in part, to obstruct the normalization talks. Now that a ceasefire is in place, Trump believes a deal can be quickly reached.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump told Fox News last month. “I think they’re going to all go in very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, some hurdles remain in getting the crown prince on board. While he and Trump are expected to sign a defense cooperation agreement Tuesday, it falls short of the treaty under discussion in earlier phases of normalization discussions, the US official said. A formal treaty would require congressional approval.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia has also said a condition to normalizing ties with Israel is a “credible” and “irreversible” pathway to Palestinian statehood, which the Gaza plan Trump helped broker stops short of providing.\n \n\n   \n  And for Saudi Arabia, another issue is high on the agenda — the stability of Sudan, which it views as critical for its own security, believing that only Trump can stop external support for the civil war there.\n \n\n   \n  But American officials are nonetheless hopeful about making progress on the normalization issue during Tuesday’s meeting.\n \n\n   \n  One of the architects of the Abraham Accords, Trump’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner , visited Riyadh last week for talks with the crown prince ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, a White House official and a person familiar with the matter said. Kushner has long had a close, personal relationship with the Saudi prince, and has been deployed several times in recent months to use his ties to Mideast leaders to help lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda and build upon the Abraham Accords.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the sensitive dynamic of the visit are Trump’s  personal financial interests in the region . The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. Kushner also has significant business ties to the country. Kushner’s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has raised billions of dollars in capital from Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated on Monday with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/trump-epstein-files-reluctant-reversal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"The prospect of an embarrassing defeat convinced Trump to reverse course on Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his opposition to the release of Jeffrey Epstein files after realizing that political pressure and the momentum of the House legislation would lead to an inevitable defeat if he continued resisting.

But that doesn’t mean he’s happy about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump threw his support behind a congressional effort to release all the files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after it became clear that he could not halt its momentum and that he risked suffering an embarrassing blow on the House floor, people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The stark reality, which was conveyed to Trump by allies and advisers in recent days, drove the president’s abrupt reversal Sunday evening and his comments Monday that he’ll sign the measure if it comes to his desk. It’s a decision he came to reluctantly, but one that is now likely to clear the way for the measure’s overwhelming passage in the House on Tuesday and for the Senate to take it up after that.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure, I would,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Monday when asked whether he’d sign the measure.\n \n\n   \n  It was a rare moment of retreat for a president who has made a habit of bending Washington to his will since returning to office. And it came after the White House privately tried and failed last week to pressure a handful of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support for the measure, and days after Trump attacked those defectors as “soft and foolish.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again,” the president wrote in one post on Truth Social. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republicans would fall into that trap.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump remains personally frustrated by the continuing focus on the Epstein files, the people familiar with the matter said, viewing them as a distraction from his agenda that Democrats have since co-opted as fodder for political attacks. The president resents being tied to Epstein, who he has said he cut ties with well before Epstein was charged with any crimes, and has been irritated at the central role some of his close allies have played in the campaign for the files, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Just 48 hours before flipping his stance on the Epstein files, Trump attacked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in bitterly personal terms over her strident support for the House measure, withdrawing his endorsement and labeling the Georgia Republican a “traitor.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump ultimately shifted his own position after advisers and allies convinced him that the House measure’s passage was inevitable despite his best efforts — and that fighting it was only fueling more attention.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in what one of the people familiar with the matter characterized as a tactical move, Trump and his allies are hoping that backing the speedy passage of the measure will allow Republicans to move past the issue more quickly and give the administration an opening to refocus attention on policy efforts that Trump has complained are going ignored.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll just get this done and move it on,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend. “There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson on Monday suggested he may vote for the measure after months of siding with Trump against it, citing new optimism that the Senate will “be able to correct” some of his concerns over its language.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since adopted that attitude, encouraging Republicans on Monday to shift their focus to areas that are viewed as far more crucial to next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “All I want is I want for people to recognize a great job that I’ve done on pricing, on affordability,” he said. “I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump in the meantime has also sought to turn the Epstein issue against Democrats, ordering a Justice Department investigation of the former financier’s ties to a range of people including former President Bill Clinton and prominent economic adviser  Larry Summers . (Neither has been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and nor has Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the probe as evidence that Trump has wanted “transparency related to the Epstein files.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s announcement has sparked fresh questions about whether the Justice Department could then cite the open investigation in refusing to turn over documents to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN that Trump has not ordered the department to stand in the way of any congressional requests, but it’s unclear how it will respond if the House measure is ultimately signed into law.\n \n\n   \n  That consideration, though, is likely weeks away. The Senate is due to break for a Thanksgiving recess at the end of the week, meaning it likely could not take up the measure until December at the earliest. And despite the broad bipartisan support in the House, Senate Majority Leader John Thune remains uncommitted on bringing the Epstein measure to the floor quickly, or even at all, a GOP leadership aide said.\n \n\n   \n  That provides the White House with an opening that allies hope Trump can take advantage of to refocus voters and elevate the far more advantageous elements of his agenda, the people familiar with the matter said — for at least as long as they can keep the Epstein issue at bay.\n \n\n   \n  “It never fully gets tamped … and part of that is just the sheer fact that a conspiracy theory never goes away,” said Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist. “Trump has ways of distracting and turning our attention away, but what’s to say it doesn’t pop up two months down the road or six months down the road?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself alluded to that on Monday when voicing his support for releasing the files.\n \n\n   \n  “No matter what we give, it’s never enough,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/ariana-grande-wicked-singapore-intrusion-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-04:30","title":"Serial intruder who accosted Ariana Grande at Wicked premiere in Singapore sentenced to 9 days in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Johnson Wen, known online as 'Pyjama Man', a serial stage intruder from Australia, was sentenced to nine days in prison in Singapore for accosting pop star Ariana Grande during a Wicked: For Good premiere at Universal Studios Singapore on November 13, 2025.

Venezuelan cartel that may not technically exist? \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Katie Bo Lillis, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the Trump administration ramps up the pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, experts and former government officials have raised concerns about its  move to designate Cartel de los Soles  as a foreign terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  They argue it is not a formally organized cartel similar to criminal organizations in Colombia and Mexico, and it’s a stretch to suggest Maduro leads it, though there is government involvement in the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  They suggested the designation provides the administration a justification to take military action against the Venezuelan government.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said as much on Sunday, telling reporters that the designation could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What we know about Cartel de los Soles\n \n\n   \n  Cartel de los Soles, which means cartel of the suns in English, is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, say experts.\n \n\n   \n  But given its lack of hierarchy and structure, some say it can’t be compared to traditional cartels that have been designated as terror groups by the US, and others suggest it technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re designating a non-thing that is not a terror organization as a terrorist organization,” said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  Another former senior US government official said Cartel de los Soles was “a made-up name used to describe an ad hoc group of Venezuelan officials involved in the trafficking of drugs through Venezuela. It doesn’t have the hierarchy or command-and-control structure of a traditional cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  The official said the Trump administration’s assertions are based on “bad intel” likely from the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny before the greater intelligence community, or that “it is purely political.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the DIA and DEA for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The name emerged in the 1990s, after Venezuelan generals and commanders – who wore sun insignias on their epaulettes – were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes, according to the think tank  InsightCrime .\n \n\n   \n  The name caught on and was frequently used, especially from the mid-2000s onward, when several members of different branches of the military assumed more active roles in drug trafficking, InsightCrime said in a recent report.\n \n\n   \n  Jeremy McDermott, cofounder and co-director of InsightCrime, told CNN that the so-called cartel “is not a traditional, vertically organized drug trafficking organization. It is, at least according to InsightCrime, a series of normally disconnected cells embedded within the Venezuelan military.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the  State Department , Cartel de los Soles, along with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal organization and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, are responsible for drug trafficking to the United States and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas,  previously told CNN  that “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t mean that there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking. “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” the expert said.\n \n\n   \n  For Gunson, Maduro’s role is reminiscent of that of former Panamanian President Manuel  Noriega , who was sentenced to decades in prison in various jurisdictions for his association with the Medellín cartel in 1992: an external partner who, while not directly part of a cartel, still benefited from drug trafficking routes under his protection.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel.\n \n\n   \n  “Suddenly, they (the US) dusted off something they call the Cartel de los Soles, which they have never been able to prove, because it doesn’t exist. It’s the narrative of imperialism,” Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said a few days ago.\n \n\n   \n  CNN contacted the Venezuelan Attorney General’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n    What is the purpose of the designation?\n \n\n   \n  The foreign terrorist organization (FTO) designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the move could allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela, as Trump has suggested.\n \n\n   \n  The US has traditionally treated counternarcotics work as a law enforcement matter, but Trump has increasingly sought to militarize those efforts, using traditional counterterrorism tools and authorities – something that Finucane said is really a smokescreen for the operation’s true purpose: to oust Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  “The concerning aspect of this move is that it could be a prelude to military action against the Venezuelan government itself,” Finucane said, calling it another step in Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s “efforts to cloak a regime change operation in the guise of counternarcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration, he said, is “inventing a fact pattern” and “creating an alternate reality” in order to be able to publicly characterize its policy toward Venezuela as a counterterrorism campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Although designating a foreign organization as a terror organization carries no legal authority for military strikes – it technically only authorizes financial and diplomatic penalties, such as the freezing of assets – the administration has nevertheless used it as a precursor to military action in the recent past. The US military has struck 22 small boats that the administration claims were manned by criminal gangs that it designated as foreign terror organizations.\n \n\n   \n  Those designations have drawn scrutiny from legal experts because some of the gangs and cartels the US has designated are motivated by profit, not ideology. Terror groups, traditionally, have been defined as groups carrying out political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Designating Cartel de los Soles, which may not even be a formal organization, takes that already-contested logic a step further. “They’re basically operating outside of the law which is why there is no limiting principle,” Finucane said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/indiana-house-cleaner-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"Indiana Homeowner Charged in Fatal Shooting of House Cleaner Who Showed Up at the Wrong Door","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Curt Andersen, a 62-year-old Indiana homeowner, was charged with voluntary manslaughter after fatally shooting Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, a 32-year-old Guatemalan immigrant house cleaner, who had mistakenly arrived at his home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb.

was charged with voluntary manslaughter on Monday in a case that could test the limits of stand-your-ground laws.\n \n\n   \n  Curt Andersen, 62, could face anywhere from 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if he’s convicted. He was being held in the Boone County Jail pending an initial court hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Officers found Maria Florinda Rios Perez De Velasquez, 32, dead on the front porch of a home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb, on Nov. 5. Authorities said the Guatemalan immigrant was part of a cleaning crew that  went to the wrong house just before 7 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Andersen shot her through the front door with no warning about a minute after hearing someone trying to unlock the door, according to a probable cause statement.\n \n\n   \n  Rios’ husband told media outlets that he was with her on the porch. He didn’t realize she had been shot until she fell back into his arms, bleeding. On a fundraising page, her brother described Rios as a mother of four children.\n \n\n   \n    Case puts stand-your-ground law in the spotlight\n \n\n   \n  Indiana is one of 31 states with a stand-your-ground law that permits homeowners to use deadly force to stop someone they believe is trying to unlawfully enter their dwelling. But police said that there’s no evidence Rios entered the home before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s attorney, Guy Relford, posted a statement on X saying he was disappointed that prosecutors charged his client. He said Andersen had every reason to believe his actions were justified and the stand-your-ground law clearly protects him.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Andersen’s actions must be evaluated based on the circumstances as he perceived them,” Relford said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood told reporters at a news conference that the decision to charge Andersen wasn’t difficult. Stand-your-ground protections don’t apply because Andersen lacked enough information to know if his actions were reasonable, Eastwood said.\n \n\n   \n  The prosecutor said he planned to prove that Andersen couldn’t have reasonably believed he needed to use deadly force, given what he knew at the time.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Commotion at the door’\n \n\n   \n  According to the probable cause statement, Andersen told investigators that he and his wife were asleep in an upstairs bedroom when he heard a “commotion at the door” that grew more intense. He thought someone was using keys or tools on the front door.\n \n\n   \n  Frightened, he went to the top of the stairwell and saw through the home’s windows that two people were outside the front door. He said to himself, “What am I going to do? It’s not going away and I have to do something now.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he loaded his handgun, went back to the windows and saw the people “thrusting” at the door and getting more aggressive, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  He fired one shot toward the door. He said the door never opened and he didn’t announce himself or say anything before he pulled the trigger.\n \n\n   \n  When told he had killed Rios, he put his head down on the table and said he didn’t mean for anything to happen to anybody.\n \n\n   \n    Wife says Andersen told a neighbor he would shoot any intruder\n \n\n   \n  Andersen’s wife, Yoshie Andersen, told investigators that her husband told her that he told a neighbor if anyone tried to break into his house he would shoot them. The probable cause statement does not say when this conversation happened.\n \n\n   \n  She added that her husband fired the shot from the top of the stairs and neither of them went downstairs. He fired the shot and then told her to call 911, she said.\n \n\n   \n    No evidence of forcible entry\n \n\n   \n  Investigators found a bullet hole in the door, but no evidence of any forceful contact with the door itself, the latch or the door frame, according to the probable cause statement.\n \n\n   \n  Rios’ husband, Mauricio Velasquez, told investigators that she tried to open the door with keys from their cleaning company, but they unknowingly were at the wrong address. He said they’d been trying to open the door for 30 seconds to a minute before she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  He said they never heard any voices from inside or saw any movement. The couple didn’t knock, bang on the door or use force of any kind to enter the home and they never got inside, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Stand-your-ground cases elsewhere\n \n\n   \n  The shooting echoes a similar episode in Missouri in 2023 when  an 86-year-old man shot Ralph Yarl  after the 16-year-old Black teenager came to his door by mistake. Missouri has a similar stand-your-ground law, but prosecutors charged the shooter, Andrew Lester, with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and didn’t go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, which does not have a stand-your-ground law, a  man was convicted in 2024 of second-degree murder  for fatally shooting a woman inside a car who mistakenly came down the driveway of his rural upstate home.\n \n\n   \n  Jody Madeira, an Indiana University law professor who specializes in gun rights, said last week that the Rios case was “horrible” and “exceptionally unusual.”\n \n\n   \n  In general, the public can legally access private property — including a front porch — for a legitimate purpose until they are told to leave, Madeira said. For example, a homeowner can’t legally shoot a pizza delivery person or an Amazon driver just for stepping onto their property, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Madeira said Monday that the allegations in the probable cause statement show that Curt Andersen was acting out of fear but that’s not enough to invoke the stand-your-ground law. There was no unlawful entry and trying to insert a key into a lock or rattling a doorknob isn’t a reasonable justification for firing a shot, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The reasonable person says, ‘hey, I have my phone here, I have other options, I can shout a warning. It’s 7 a.m., is someone really breaking into my house? He jumped up from bed and immediately went into I’m combatting a break-in.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/jesse-jackson-moved-from-icu-hospitalized","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:22:00-05:00","title":"Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to be removed from the ICU but will remain hospitalized","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Civil rights leader Rev.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:37 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration on Monday challenged in federal court California’s ban on  most law enforcement officers from wearing masks during operations , a move the Department of Justice insisted was necessary to protect federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  In a lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California, the Trump administration argued that  California’s law,  signed in September in response to immigration raids over the summer in Los Angeles, was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate federal law enforcement officers.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after months of immigration arrests conducted by masked federal agents who use  aggressive tactics  across the country. California’s ban was slated to go into effect in January next year.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted masks are an important precaution taken to maintain the safety of law enforcement officers. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a  press release  Monday that “they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties.”\n \n\n   \n  “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has insisted the ban pushes back against the federal government’s use of masked agents without identification or badge numbers to detain people on the streets during immigration raids.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,” Newsom said at a press conference when he signed the law. “Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today.”\n \n\n   \n  The law, the first of its kind in the United States according to the Associated Press, bars neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers who are conducting official business. There are exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks and tactical gear. The ban does not apply to state police.\n \n\n   \n  Currently, there is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Historically, officers have almost always concealed their faces only while performing undercover work to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, law enforcement experts  have told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  The practice of hiding of agents’ faces, badges and identifying uniforms has made it difficult for members of the public to know whether the immigration arrests over the past several months are legitimate. John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told CNN in August that it was “incredibly dangerous” for the officers to make arrests without clearly identifying themselves.\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is really obvious, right? You’re sitting there and all of a sudden a bunch of masked men run out and are grabbing someone on the street,” he said on the  CNN One Thing  podcast. “There are good, well-intentioned bystanders who might think that they need to step in and help and that they’re witnessing a kidnapping.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Levenson and Josh Campbell contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/hongkong-soccer-stadium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-05:00","title":"Hong Kong’s Soccer Resurgence Sparks Record Attendance at New Stadium","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hong Kong’s national soccer team, ranked 148th in the world, has experienced a dramatic resurgence in fan support following the opening of the new Kai Tak Sports Park in March 2025.

International soccer’s 148th-best team is pulling crowds of nearly 50,000 people \n       \n  By Fred He, James Legge, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a steamy Tuesday night in June, 42,570 Hongkongers packed into a spectacular new harborside stadium located in their city’s urban heart.\n \n\n   \n   Built on the site of a former airport , the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Sports Park was completed this March – and has been the crucible of a resurgence in support for the local team, where a red sea of fans now regularly cheers on the players.\n \n\n   \n  Ranked 148th in the world – just between Ethiopia and the Solomon Islands – Hong Kong’s soccer team has never seen home crowds of this size, with attendances even for crucial qualifiers normally under 15,000.\n \n\n   \n  But recent games have pulled in audiences more like those at top-tier international matches.\n \n\n   \n  “We never had this many fans watching the Hong Kong team,” said Shinichi Chan, the 23-year-old rising star who is a regular starter of the team. “The stadium is becoming our new home.”\n \n\n   \n  Chester Cheung was among the crowd on June 10, a day he won’t forget. That night, Hong Kong defeated India 1-0 in the Asian Cup qualifiers – a series of matches deciding which teams go to the continent’s showpiece event in Saudi Arabia in 2027. For Cheung, a core member of a Hong Kong fan group, watching the team’s debut at the brand-new stadium was “a dream come true.”\n \n\n   \n  “I cried,” said the 29-year-old, who spent two to three months preparing for the game with his organization Chisinlo, named after a Cantonese phrase meaning “crazy people”.\n \n\n   \n  Arriving three to four hours before the game, Cheung and his mates from the group prepared flags, drums, megaphones, banners, and face-painting stickers. They also helped display a huge tifo, which they had a hand in designing.\n \n\n   \n  The fans’ energy set the stage for the players.\n \n\n   \n  “Wearing the Hong Kong team jersey, walking out of the tunnel, and seeing all the fans supporting Hong Kong is such an unbelievable feeling,” recalled Chan, who played midfielder at the game against India. “It is always going to be in my mind and push me ever harder to play better football.”\n \n\n   \n  The momentum rolled into to the next home game, where more than 45,000 fans filled the stands - a new record for the team - during a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh last month.\n \n\n   \n  Cheung said the team’s debut at Kai Tak was “a very good entry point” for those who had not watched much soccer before, as many of them were attracted by social media videos of that game and decided to give the following games a try.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday, Hong Kong will face Singapore at its third home game at Kai Tak, and tickets are already sold out.\n \n\n   \n  The packed stands should come as little surprise in a city with a rich soccer tradition going back to its time as a British colony.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong’s first professional league was established as early as 1908, one of the oldest in Asia. It flourished in the 1970s and 80s, but since then has lost fans lured by globalized European leagues, in particular the English Premier League.\n \n\n   \n  The team’s more hardcore fans in the past have also been outspoken supporters of Hong Kong’s unique Cantonese identity, culture and language, something that has occasionally caused political frictions with local authorities. Britain handed the Asian financial hub back to China in 1997 under an agreement where it is meant to keep a level of autonomy for 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  In the years leading up to the massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019, China’s national anthem was  frequently greeted with jeers and boos  from supporters of the local team.\n \n\n   \n  Hong Kong authorities have since  made it illegal  to show disrespect to the national anthem, silencing the jeering in the stands as such public act of defiance could now lead to fines and lengthy imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n    New stadium\n \n\n   \n  In addition to serving as the home stadium for the city’s soccer team, the Kai Tak Sports Park is central to Hong Kong’s bid to reclaim its status as Asia’s premier destination for mega-events, after losing out to rival cities like Singapore and Tokyo in attracting some of the world’s biggest stars.\n \n\n   \n  And the progress is already noticeable. Since April, the sprawling waterfront complex has hosted performers from the rock band Coldplay to Asian pop stars JJ Lin and Jay Chou, as well as major sport events including  Rugby Sevens  and English soccer’s  North London Derby .\n \n\n   \n  But for Cheung, who has followed the Hong Kong soccer team at different home venues for 10 years, the best part about Kai Tak Sports Park is the air conditioning – not to be sniffed at in a subtropical city of swelteringly humid summers.\n \n\n   \n  “So no matter the weather, no matter how hot it is, it is still very comfortable inside, ” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just Hong Kong seeing large fan-bases for teams that are far from the top of international rankings.\n \n\n   \n  Soccer across Southeast Asia has been drawing bigger crowds in recent years. Countries and regions are putting more efforts into naturalizing foreign players and cultivating young talents, which has helped boost their competitiveness on the Asian stage.\n \n\n   \n  The international nature of Hong Kong is also reflected in the team’s ethnic diversity.\n \n\n   \n  It now blends a growing group of naturalized players, including Brazil-born striker Everton Camargo and France-born winger Raphaël Merkies, with a core of local talent thriving in mainland China’s top-tier league. Chan is among them, now in his second impressive season with Shanghai Shenhua after helping the top Chinese club lift last year’s league title.\n \n\n   \n  Both fans and players are ready for the do-or-die game against Singapore Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I expect a great atmosphere, and every (fan) will spend 120% of their efforts in cheering and supporting the team,” said Cheung, who will be in the stadium with the fan group. “We are telling the fans that this time is not for entertainment. It is a fight. It’s a war.”\n \n\n   \n  For Chan and his teammates, victory is the only goal, with a spot in Saudi Arabia still up for grabs.\n \n\n   \n  “Kai Tak is giving me this feeling that we are stepping forward together as Hong Kong football, with the better venue, to play and provide better experiences for the fans,” said Chan. “And hopefully, we can create something great together.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/asia/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-verdict-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:57:00-05:00","title":"Bangladesh’s ousted leader Sheikh Hasina sentenced to death after crimes against humanity conviction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has been sentenced to death by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) for crimes against humanity related to the violent suppression of student protests in 2024, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries.

enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina has been staying in self-imposed exile in India’s capital New Delhi since August 2024, after student protesters forced her and the Awami League political party out of power. She was not present at the court in Dhaka.\n \n\n   \n  The former prime minister faced five charges primarily related to inciting the murder of the protestors, ordering demonstrators be hanged, and ordering the use of lethal weapons, drones and helicopters to suppress the unrest. She has long denied the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The courtroom, where some victims’ families were present, burst into applause as the judges delivered their sentence.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheikh Hasina committed crimes against humanity by her incitement, order and failure to take punitive measures,” one of the judges said as he delivered the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  It was “crystal clear” that she “expressed her incitement to the activists of her party … and furthermore, she expressed that she ordered to kill and eliminate the protesting students,” the judges said.\n \n\n   \n  For a nation still reeling from the popular revolt that ousted her, the verdict represents a stunning culmination. For many, it offers judicial validation for an uprising fueled by years of simmering anger against the creeping authoritarianism that defined her long rule.\n \n\n   \n  The verdict’s impact is also being felt in New Delhi. Bangladesh’s interim government has formally demanded the extradition of its former leader, but India has so far remained silent on the request.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi on Monday said it will “engage constructively with all stakeholders.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a close neighbour, India remains committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  What began as peaceful student demonstrations over civil service job quotas transformed into a nationwide push for Hasina’s resignation. The turning point was a government crackdown that may have killed up to 1,400 people,  according to  the UN’s human rights office (OHCHR). Up to 25,000 were also injured, the court heard.\n \n\n   \n  The UN declared the verdict on Monday as an “important moment for victims” but cautioned that rights advocates “regret the imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  “While we were not privy to the conduct of this trial, we have consistently advocated for all accountability proceedings – especially on charges of international crimes – to unquestionably meet international standards of due process and fair trial,” OHCHR spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  Hasina slammed the “biased and politically motivated” tribunal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement shared by her Awami League party on social media, following the verdict.\n \n\n   \n  “I reject the ICT’s other allegations of human rights abuses as equally unevidenced. I am very proud of my government’s record on human rights and development,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina ruled the South Asian nation with an iron-fist from 2009 until her ouster in 2024. Now, analysts fear the verdict on Monday could set off a wave of political chaos ahead of national elections expected in February next year.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, her lawyers submitted an appeal to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions over “serious concerns about the lack of fair trial rights and due process.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, government officials in Dhaka called on the Indian government to “hand over these two sentenced individuals to Bangladesh authorities without delay.” “This is India’s responsibility in keeping with the existing bilateral extradition treaty between both countries,” the Bangladeshi foreign ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Break it down and burn it’\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of protesters descended on the crumbled residence of Hasina’s father – former Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – in Dhanmondi neighborhood, central Bangladesh, before the verdict on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Footage from local media showed demonstrators – who arrived with two bulldozers – lighting the street on fire. Some chanted, “Break it down and burn it,” referring to the Hasina family’s dynastic grip on power. Army and police forces hurled batons at them, video showed.\n \n\n   \n  Others received the verdict as a call for celebration, with students at the prestigious Dhaka University organizing a rally and distributing sweets.\n \n\n   \n  It came after violence erupted in the capital Dhaka on Sunday, with several Molotov cocktails exploding after being thrown by people on bikes, police said.\n \n\n   \n  Security had been tightened, with armored vehicles and officers with riot shields placed around the courthouse, and police, border guard and rapid action teams deployed near key government buildings.\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s son on Sunday told Reuters that supporters of her party would block next year’s elections if a ban on her party was not lifted, warning that protests could become violent.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” he said. “Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes. Unless the international community does something, eventually there’s probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections … there’s going to be confrontations.”\n \n\n   \n  Hasina’s political journey is a story of tragedy, exile and power, inextricably linked to the history of her home country itself. Under her stewardship, Bangladesh was ushered into an era of significant economic development albeit alongside accusations of corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and human rights abuses.\n \n\n   \n    A life in politics\n \n\n   \n  The eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh, she was thrust into politics early in life as she witnessed the struggle for Bengali autonomy from Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  Following a 1975 military coup in which her father, mother, and three brothers were assassinated, Hasina and her sister were forced into exile. She returned to Bangladesh in 1981 to lead her father’s Awami League, and after years of political opposition, first became Prime Minister when the party won the 1996 election.\n \n\n   \n  She served for one term and later returned to power in 2008, ruling Bangladesh with her Awami League until last year.\n \n\n   \n  Bangladesh had seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but human rights organizations warned that she and her government were headed toward a one-party system. Critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n \n\n   \n  During her time in power, rights groups say the government used its cyber security law to crack down on freedom of expression online, arresting journalists, artists and activists, with reported cases of arbitrary detention and torture.\n \n\n   \n  But Hasina managed to weather many previous protests against her rule.\n \n\n   \n  That changed last year with the successful Gen Z-led revolution that toppled her.\n \n\n   \n  Many of her family members, along with prominent party leaders and former ministers from her administration have also fled Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of Hasina dismiss the legal proceedings as politically motivated and designed to remove her from the political arena. The Awami League party has been banned from political activities while the trials against Hasina and party leaders continues.\n \n\n   \n  The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, asserts that these trials are an essential step toward restoring accountability and rebuilding public trust in the nation’s democratic institutions.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/john-beam-coach-shooting-cedric-irving-jr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00-05:00","title":"Man Charged with Murder in Shooting of Oakland Football Coach and 'Last Chance U' Star John Beam","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 27-year-old man, Cedric Irving, was charged with murdering John Beam, a celebrated former football coach and 'Last Chance U' star, who was shot in the head at Laney College in Oakland.

The Netflix docuseries “Last Chance U” focused on Beam and the Laney Eagles in its 2020 season. He’d most recently been serving as the school’s athletic director after retiring from coaching last year.\n \n\n   \n  “He really is the best of Oakland — was the best of Oakland,” Jones Dickson said. “His spirit is still here.”\n \n\n   \n  The district attorney said Irving had no criminal record.

\nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James says the Trump administration engaged in “outrageous” conduct to overcome hurdles to bring the mortgage fraud case against her and urged a judge to throw out the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers point to the collective actions of President Donald Trump; Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who made the criminal referral to the Justice Department; Attorney General Pam Bondi;  Lindsey Halligan , the US attorney who brought the case; and Ed Martin, the special attorney in charge of mortgage fraud cases.\n \n\n   \n  “This indictment is the product of months of illegal and unethical behavior by government officials, only made possible by the misuse of a federal agency, the disregard of exculpatory evidence, the systematic removal of ethics officials and career prosecutors who stood in the way, and the improper attempt to install an unqualified U.S. Attorney with nothing to offer except undying loyalty,” lawyers for James  wrote in a motion Monday  to dismiss the case.\n \n\n   \n  “If this brazen, continuous disregard for the law and the Constitution is not outrageous government conduct, nothing is,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The motion, which is a long shot, is one of several legal maneuvers James’ lawyers have launched to try to get the charges dismissed. The indictment alleges she misled a lender when she obtained a mortgage in 2020 on a property in Norfolk, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  James  has previously argued  the charges should be thrown out on the basis that the case is the result of vindictive and selective prosecution and that Halligan is serving unlawfully as US attorney. She is also asking the judge to provide her with material from the grand jury presentation, including whether any exculpatory evidence was presented. Prosecutors have not yet responded to the filings.\n \n\n   \n  James has  pleaded not guilty , and a trial is scheduled for January.\n \n\n   \n  In the latest filing, James’ lawyers raised questions about the source of material for Pulte’s referral, suggesting he may have improperly accessed loan files from Fannie Mae’s database. Citing media reports, the lawyers say Pulte fired officials from the FHFA inspector general’s office who were looking into whether he followed internal procedures.\n \n\n   \n  They also highlighted internal messages between investigators at Fannie Mae to support their claim. In one message, dated June 13, 2025, the Fannie Mae director of mortgage fraud investigations told an associate: “the LJ case is certainly not clear and convincing evidence” of fraud,” according to the court filing. The associate responds, “director asking how we know that the [niece] has lived there since oct 2020,” which James’ lawyers say is “clearly demonstrating Director Pulte’s intimate and direct involvement in the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James is accused of falsely stating she would use the property as a second home. Prosecutors allege she rented out the property and benefited from lower interest rates by receiving a mortgage for a second home instead of an investment property. People familiar with the arrangement say James’ grandniece has lived in the property since it was purchased and has never paid rent.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, James’ lawyers’ argued, played a hands-on role and sent additional information, including a financial calculation of interest rate differences, to Martin and Halligan, who was named US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after  her predecessor refused  to bring a case against James.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to Pulte, James’ lawyers say Martin’s conduct violated professional rules and DOJ policy by suggesting if James resigned the investigation would be dropped. They also said when Martin  posed for photos  outside of James’ Brooklyn home, it was an act of intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  “The charges she now faces are inextricably linked to the government’s illegal and unethical investigatory techniques,” James’ lawyers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge doesn’t dismiss the indictment, James’ lawyers are asking for additional communication between Trump, Bondi, Halligan, Martin and Pulte, as well as their staff.\n \n\n   \n  Based on some information they have already received, her lawyers wrote, “over 100 pages of discovery likely turned over by the former FHFA acting inspector general has not been produced.”\n \n\n   \n    Asks for grand jury records\n \n\n   \n  James’ team on Monday also asked the court to order prosecutors to  turn over documents related to the grand jury  in Alexandria, Virginia, that approved the charges against her in October, as well as one empaneled in Norfolk this summer as the Justice Department was investigating her.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan ultimately asked only the Alexandria grand jury to vote on the charges, something James’ attorneys described as a “unique set of circumstances” that warranted their right to sift through a trove of documents they don’t have access to in order to “assess whether the grand jury that brought the indictment was selected, presented to and instructed properly.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the materials James’ team wants access to are documents concerning how the jurors in Alexandria were screened, statements Halligan made to the jurors in Alexandria, and whether certain information provided to the Norfolk grand jury — including potentially exculpatory facts — was also given to the jurors who were asked to vote on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the investigation has said James’ grandniece testified before the Norfolk grand jury.\n \n\n   \n  “The need for disclosing the narrow set of grand jury materials being requested is high,” James’ lawyers wrote in court papers, acknowledging the fact that the documents sought are ordinarily kept under wraps.\n \n\n   \n  A similar fight over grand jury records in James Comey’s criminal case has been underway in recent weeks. A judge has ordered prosecutors in the former FBI director’s case to hand over all grand jury materials to Comey’s team, but the government is trying to stop that decision.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/national-guard-portland-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:55:00-05:00","title":"Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago are being sent home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown are being withdrawn, with all 200 California troops returning home and Oregon’s deployment reduced from 200 to 100.

\nUpdated: \n        5:55 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, are being sent home, and those who will remain will continue to stay off the streets amid  court battles  over their domestic mission by the Trump administration, a defense official said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The withdrawal of soldiers — sent from California and Texas — is part of a larger change to troop deployments after  President Donald Trump  began his  immigration crackdown  in various cities with Democratic leadership. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and requested anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  US Northern Command said in a statement Sunday it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” units in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, although it said there would be a “constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.”\n \n\n   \n  In the coming days, all 200 California National Guard troops currently deployed to Portland will be sent home, the official said. The military also plans to cut the number of Oregon National Guard troops on deployment there from 200 soldiers to 100, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago also are being sent home and about 200 soldiers will be on standby at Fort Bliss, an Army base that stretches across parts of Texas and New Mexico, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  About 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area, also doing training, but they currently are not legally allowed to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The official said the upcoming holiday season may have played a role in the change in deployments.\n \n\n   \n  Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, applauded the return of all California National Guard troops in Oregon, saying Trump “never should have illegally deployed our troops in the first place.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re glad they’re finally coming home,” she wrote in an email. “It’s long overdue!”\n \n\n   \n  Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek called on the Trump administration to demobilize the remaining 100 troops in her state, as well.\n \n\n   \n  “Members of the Oregon National Guard, who are our friends and neighbors, have been away from their families and jobs for 50 days on an unnecessary deployment,” Kotek said in a written statement. “With the holidays approaching, every single member deserves to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said the Trump administration  doesn’t communicate its plans  with state leaders and was still threatening to federalize more troops.\n \n\n   \n  “This confirms what we have always known: This is about normalizing military forces in American cities,” Pritzker spokesman Matt Hill said in a statement Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Hill didn’t immediately return a message left Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue currently before the US Supreme Court —  have been pushing back . They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Karin Immergut in  Portland this month  issued a permanent injunction blocking Trump from deploying troops in the city, saying he had failed to establish that he was legally entitled to do so. On Sunday, the administration filed an emergency motion seeking to put the ruling on hold while it appeals.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, the Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in  Charlotte, North Carolina , expanding an aggressive campaign that’s been spearheaded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard deployments have been one of the most controversial initiatives of Trump’s second term, demonstrating an expanded willingness to use the military to accomplish domestic goals.\n \n\n   \n  Troops,  including active-duty Marines , were deployed to Los Angeles during immigration protests earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard was also sent to  Washington, D.C. , where they were part of a broader federal intervention that Trump claimed was necessary because of crime problems.\n \n\n   \n  The deployments later expanded to Portland and Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Although they don’t play a law enforcement role, members of the National Guard have been tasked with protecting federal facilities, particularly those run by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  About 100 troops who have been in Los Angeles will remain on deployment there, the defense official said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine-gavi-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:24:00-05:00","title":"US funding cuts imperil global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on how unexpected US funding cuts to Gavi, a global health initiative supporting HPV vaccination in low-income countries, threaten progress toward eliminating cervical cancer.

She was one of the 349,000 women globally who die from the preventable cancer every year. Thirteen years later, he jumped at the chance to protect his family and community from undergoing such loss again.\n \n\n   \n  In May 2024, Modu helped launch Borno’s first immunization campaign to vaccinate adolescent girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), the pathogen that causes nearly all cervical cancers. And he made sure two of his daughters, including the youngest child of his late wife, were among the first to be protected.\n \n\n   \n  “More than any other person, I was so excited when I heard about the vaccine,” said Modu, who has 10 children.\n \n\n   \n  “I was so happy that they were safe,” he said. “It reminds me of the lost glory of my wife.”\n \n\n   \n  His daughters were among 86 million girls vaccinated as part of a campaign led by Gavi, a public-private partnership that works with government health systems in lower-income countries to protect children and adolescents against   more than 20 infectious diseases. Seventy-three million of those girls were vaccinated in just the past three years, most of them in Africa and Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Its HPV vaccination program is a key piece of the World Health Organization’s  global strategy  to put cervical cancer on a path to elimination, following diseases like measles, polio and smallpox. But the pace of its progress against HPV and cervical cancer is now under threat after unexpected funding cuts by the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi set an ambitious target to dramatically scale up its HPV vaccine program in 2023. On Monday, the organization announced that it had met its goals.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanks to incredible commitment from countries, partners, civil society and communities, we have now reached that target ahead of schedule,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s CEO. “This collaborative effort is driving major global progress towards eliminating one of the deadliest diseases affecting women.”\n \n\n   \n  But the celebration is taking place under a heavy shadow. In June, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stunned health officials when, in a video address to world leaders gathered to pledge funding to Gavi, he said the US was pulling all financial support until the organization could “re-earn the public’s trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has repeatedly  targeted the US vaccine system  since taking office, praised Gavi’s commitment to “making medicine affordable to all the world’s people” but criticized   its messaging about vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Gavi’s handling of vaccine safety issues.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi issued a  detailed statement  in response to Kennedy’s claims, defending its commitment to children’s health and use of independent WHO experts, noting that it “remains committed to continuing an evidence-based and scientific approach to its work and investment decisions, as it always has done.” It has continued to engage with the US government on restoring funding in the months since, a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s budget comes from national governments and private funders, including philanthropies, corporations and individual donors, with the US having been – until recently – one of its largest supporters. Since its founding in 2000, the organization has helped immunize over 1.2 billion children in 78 lower-income countries, efforts that have prevented an estimated 20.6 million deaths.\n \n\n   \n  No country had ever withdrawn a financial commitment to Gavi, according to the organization. The US provided about 13% of its funding. If that isn’t restored, combined with other reduced pledges, Gavi will be left with a nearly $3 billion shortfall – approximately a quarter of its expected budget. That could force a significant scaling back of the anti-cancer campaign when Gavi’s board meets next month.\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccination remains a top priority for Gavi, a spokesperson said, but financial pressure might affect how it expands coverage. “Difficult decisions will need to be made on deploying resources to areas of highest health impact.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about its stance on Gavi, HHS referred to its statement issued when Kennedy announced the pause in funding, which said “the concern is that when vaccine safety issues have come before GAVI, it has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency did not address questions about what specifically   Gavi can do to re-earn public trust in the eyes of the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The millions of HPV vaccines Gavi has given will save lives, said Dr. Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. “But there’s going to be new children and adolescents that are going to be eligible to get vaccinated every year. And having cuts to Gavi’s support is potentially going to reduce the access to vaccines in these settings.”\n \n\n   \n    A cancer-preventing vaccine\n \n\n   \n  HPV vaccines protect against a family of viruses that cause 4% of cancers globally, the most common of which is cervical cancer, the fourth deadliest cancer for women. Depending on the formulation of the vaccine, they prevent infections that cause between 70% and 90% of all cervical cancer cases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a remarkable vaccine,” said Dr. Jessica Kahn, professor of pediatrics and senior associate dean of clinical and translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who noted that it also prevents infections that cause anal, vaginal, vulvar, and head and neck cancers. “It has the potential to have a truly transformative impact on cancers around the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Introduced in 2006, the vaccine is only the second widely used vaccine that prevents cancer; the other prevents hepatitis B infections, a major cause of liver cancer. The HPV vaccine is typically given before the beginning of sexual activity, generally recommended for girls ages 9 to 14 in a two- or three-dose regimen. Its dramatic impact is becoming more obvious as the first women to receive the vaccine reach their 30s, 40s and 50s, when cervical cancer typically appears.\n \n\n   \n  “The HPV vaccine is probably one of the most effective vaccines that we have out there, and we’re constantly getting new data in on that, as the vaccine has been used for a longer period of time,” said Bednarczyk, who studies HPV vaccination. “The research really shows us that we have a very, very good tool for reducing the amount of cervical cancer and really decreasing that burden globally.”\n \n\n   \n  But for years, the vaccine was mostly available in wealthy countries, such as the United States and European nations. Further decreasing the cervical cancer burden means vaccinating school-age girls in places where cases and deaths are highest: low- and middle-income countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That requires a lot of investment, Bednarczyk says. “HPV vaccines are some of the more expensive vaccines that we have out there. That’s really where Gavi comes in.”\n \n\n   \n  In the 2010s, Gavi began piloting school-based vaccination programs. But demand soon outpaced HPV vaccine supply, leading to shortages. The organization spent years negotiating purchasing agreements with vaccine manufacturers on behalf of the 57 lower-income countries it supports.\n \n\n   \n  All the pieces were in place at the end of 2022, when a big opportunity arose to reduce cost and simplify the HPV vaccination process: WHO issued guidance that said a single dose of the vaccine confers effective protection. Gavi was ready, said Emily Kobayashi, head of Gavi’s HPV Vaccines Programme.\n \n\n   \n  “That single-dose recommendation from WHO, based on the building evidence, meant that the supply we had could go much further,” she said. “And it was easier to deliver the vaccine to girls once, rather than having to track them down and give them their second or third dose.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi quickly directed $600 million to the “revitalisation” of its HPV vaccination program, supporting countries on vaccine acquisition, investments in health systems to improve HPV vaccine delivery, and integrating HPV vaccination into routine immunisation. In 2023 alone, it helped vaccinate 14 million girls – more than in the previous eight years combined.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Game-changer’\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria, Modu’s home, was one of the first countries to launch a single-dose HPV immunization program with Gavi. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria has a cervical cancer rate that’s four times higher than in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “I was amazed when the federal government announced the introduction of HPV into immunization,” Modu said. “I mobilized my community together – my family and everybody to receive this vaccination.”\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, the country has immunized more than 13 million girls, the largest share of Gavi’s 86 million total. Nigeria is among 49 countries that have introduced HPV vaccination with Gavi support. Another seven are on track to launch programs before mid-2026, according to the organization, some of them before the end of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  By January, Gavi estimates that HPV vaccines will be available in countries that have 89% of the world’s cervical cancer burden, up from 10% a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  “This is definitely a game-changer for HPV vaccination and access to the HPV vaccine,” Kobayashi said. “Cervical cancer is one of the most painful and undignified ways to die, and it’s almost completely preventable by one shot in childhood. … It’s going from a vaccine that’s only available in a small number of places to something that’s widely available, including in lower-income countries.”\n \n\n   \n  Gavi’s current plans call for more than doubling the number of girls it has vaccinated against HPV in the next five years and continuing to expand access to more countries with high rates of cervical cancer. The goal is to vaccinate 120 million girls from 2026 to   2030. The organization spent the past year appealing to donors to fully fund its campaign to do so, which it estimates would save 1.5 million lives.\n \n\n   \n    Paused\n \n\n   \n  But in the wake of Kennedy’s stunning announcement, these ambitious goals are now in question.\n \n\n   \n  Gavi plans its work on five-year cycles, securing pledges from its major funders in advance. Since the organization was founded, the US has been among the largest funders, exceeded only by the United Kingdom and the Gates Foundation. During the Biden administration, it pledged $1.58 billion to Gavi for 2025-30, what was set to be its largest contribution yet.\n \n\n   \n  US commitments to Gavi were uninterrupted during the first Trump administration, with Trump recommitting the US pledge in 2020, but things were different almost immediately when the new administration began this year. Funding for Gavi was  abruptly paused  during the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and remains in limbo.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to engage with the U.S. and hope we can sustain the strong partnership that has endured since Gavi’s founding,” the Gavi spokesperson said. “While we have incredible bipartisan support in Congress and across U.S. Administrations, including President Trump’s robust pledge at the 2020 replenishment, this is the first time we’ve seen a committed pledge walked back.”\n \n\n   \n  Although the executive branch makes the country’s financial pledges to the organization, it’s Congress that sets the annual funding level to be distributed to Gavi. For the 2026 fiscal year, a House committee approved $300 million for Gavi, while its Senate counterpart has not yet released a State and Foreign appropriations bill. Meanwhile, Gavi has not received the $300 million Congress appropriated in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in September.\n \n\n   \n  In a response to questions about who would make the ultimate decision about releasing allocated funds, a State Department spokesperson said in an email, “The U.S. government speaks with one voice for all America First foreign policy programming,” adding that “The State Department collaborates closely with [other agencies] to implement assistance consistent with Trump Administration priorities. … The State Department has notified Gavi that the American taxpayer’s money must deliver better on the United States’ global health goals.”\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s announcement came on the heels of other Trump administration shakeups pulling back from global health initiatives, including  withdrawing from WHO  and dismantling the  US Agency for International Development .\n \n\n   \n  As those shakeups reverberated across the global health field, Gavi saw other funders partially scale back expected contributions. And vaccine experts worry that US actions will not just limit budgets but erode trust in vaccines as well.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s long history of criticizing vaccine programs – often with false and misleading claims – includes helping organize  a lawsuit  against the makers of Gardasil, the first HPV vaccine, alleging that drugmaker   Merck overstated its safety (Merck has previously said the litigation has no merit). The potential fees Kennedy would collect from the case while in office became a point of contention in his confirmation hearing, before he ultimately said he would  divest from the case.  The next month, the parties agreed to  postpone the case  until February 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate legal action in March, a federal judge ruled in Merck’s favor, dismissing more than 200 cases that similarly challenged the safety of the vaccine.\n \n\n   \n  “There are headwinds there because of vaccine disinformation and misinformation,” said Kahn, who has served on the WHO HPV Vaccine Advisory Committee and has been studying HPV vaccine effectiveness since 2006. “But this is one of the safest vaccines ever tested,” she said, citing more than 100 safety studies of 2.5 million people in six countries, which have shown no serious side effects of HPV vaccination beyond the rare allergic reactions typical for all vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “If we wanted to eliminate cervical cancer globally, we could,” said Kahn, who considers the WHO cervical cancer goals ambitious but “achievable with the right political will.”\n \n\n   \n  Those goals set a target of 90% of girls under 15 vaccinated against HPV by 2030, along with screening and treatment targets for adult women.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got these tools, we’ve got these systems to be able to prevent these cancers, but we actually need to be able to use them. And to use them, we need these concerted efforts to make sure that there is good and equitable access to these vaccines,” Bednarczyk said. “So all of these missed opportunities that we have today due to these funding cuts are potentially leaving generations of individuals more susceptible to these cancers.”\n \n\n   \n  A few countries, including the Netherlands, Brazil and Hungary, have increased financial commitments to Gavi in recent months, and the organization expects to announce several others by the end of the year. But those contributions so far total less than $200 million of the nearly $3 billion budget hole.

governor says Trump ally ‘cherry-picked’ details to make mortgage fraud claim \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said allegations she committed mortgage fraud are “baseless” and urged the Justice Department to drop its inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department  indicated this summer  it would review Cook’s mortgages after receiving a referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleging she engaged in mortgage fraud by claiming multiple properties were primary residences. President Donald Trump used the allegations as a basis to try to fire Cook. She sued to keep her job and the Supreme Court is  expected to decide   the case next year.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Monday to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin , special attorney for mortgage fraud, and obtained by CNN, Cook’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said the records indicate Cook’s applications were accurate.\n \n\n   \n  “The full record makes clear that what he claims to be contradictions in loan applications were not contradictions at all but were cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents submitted at the time and in subsequent filings by Governor Cook consistent with her applications. The referrals are baseless and should not have been made in the first place,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Pulte, who has made referrals to DOJ involving allegations of mortgage fraud against prominent Democrats, highlighted three properties Cook owns in Massachusetts, Georgia and Michigan. He alleged Cook improperly claimed they were primary residences in documents seeking mortgages, which her attorney denied.\n \n\n   \n  In the 54-page letter, including dozens of pages of exhibits, Lowell wrote that Cook took out mortgages on homes as primary residences because that is where she lived at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Cook had different principal residences over the years because her distinguished career had taken her to academic posts at Harvard University and Michigan State University, a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, and a government post at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in Washington, D.C. This reflects why different mortgage applications accurately reported different properties as her primary residence at different periods of time,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell conceded “an inadvertent notation” in a document related to a condo she purchased in Atlanta in 2021 that said the condo is a primary residence. Lowell said another loan document in the application stated the condo is a “vacation home.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because Governor Cook submitted that document to the lender as well, it would be impossible to conclude that she intended to defraud the lender by inadvertently listing the property as her ‘Primary Residence’ elsewhere,” Lowell wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell said Cook bought her first home in 2002 in Cambridge and it was her primary residence until she accepted an assistant professor position at Michigan State University and bought the property there in 2005. When Cook later refinanced the Cambridge home, Lowell said, she updated the paperwork to reflect it was no longer her primary residence.\n \n\n   \n  Cook has lived on and off at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, home since 2005, Lowell said. When she refinanced the mortgage in 2021, he said, it was still her primary residence because she was still employed at the school.\n \n\n   \n  Cook became a Federal Reserve governor in 2022. Lowell said she obtained permits to rent the property in Michigan until she returns when her term in Washington, DC, is up. He cites a city official as stating that living elsewhere on a temporary basis “does not necessarily make an owner ineligible for a principal residence exemption.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,” Lowell wrote in the letter.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represents New York Attorney General Letitia James in a criminal case on similar mortgage fraud claims initiated by Pulte.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  “The Department of Justice does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with a response from the Justice Department. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/style/met-gala-2026-theme","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"06:11:00-04:00","title":"Met Museum unveils 2026 Met Gala theme: ‘Costume Art’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its 2026 Met Gala theme as 'Costume Art,' aiming to elevate fashion as a form of embodied fine art by connecting garments to artworks and emphasizing the human body's role in fashion.

  \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  What’s the best dressed painting of all time?\n \n\n   \n  It’s a question the Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes to answer with its next Costume Institute exhibition, which it revealed on Monday morning will be   “Costume Art.” Opening May 10, the showcase will pair almost 200 artworks with around 200 garments and accessories in an effort to join the dots between fashion and fine art once and for all. “Costume Art” is also the show that will animate what is arguably fashion’s splashiest, starriest night: the Met Gala.\n \n\n   \n  “The title ‘Costume Art’ refers to the history of the Costume I﻿nstitute,” said Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator, who selects each year’s theme, at a press conference. Fashion, he explained, has “the status of art because of, and not in spite of, its relation to the body.”\n \n\n   \n  While fashion exhibitions at museums tend to divorce a garment from its life on the human form, here the Met will emphasize that connection as the quality that puts clothing on the same pedestal as a Greek statue or Albrecht Dürer engraving.\n \n\n   \n  Recently retired ballerina Misty Copeland was on hand to explain how Bolton plans to use garments and artworks to push against the notion of an idealized body: “What struck me most was his belief in fashion as an embodied art. Something deeply connected to who we are,” Copeland said. “The show makes a powerful case for the body in all its forms as a work of art, worthy of being seen, elevated and celebrated.”\n \n\n   \n  While the theme may strike some as sleepy — “fashion is art!” is well-trodden territory — it is the space, not the show’s theme, that may be the biggest news. Twelve-thousand square-feet of exhibition space will be newly dedicated to the Costume Institute, just off the museum’s Great Hall. “It really recognizes the central role of fashion not just within the Met, but within culture,” Bolton told CNN after the the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  The galleries carry an august name: Condé M. Nast, the late founder of the business that publishes Vogue, the style bible synonymous with the Met Gala, as well as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and GQ. The new space was made possible via a donation of an undisclosed size from the company. That will likely raise eyebrows: Condé Nast is in the news more frequently for its fading fortunes and disagreements with its union, than its financial wins.\n \n\n   \n  Also in attendance was Anna Wintour (sat next to Michael Kors), who earlier this year  relinquished her title as Vogue US’s editor-in-chief  but remains as Vogue’s global editorial director, as well as chief content officer for Condé Nast, meaning she retains her position supervising the annual Met Gala, which she transformed from a quiet society event into a global spectacle of celebrity and high octane fashion.\n \n\n   \n  The fashion sponsor is the French luxury label Saint Laurent, along with Condé Nast and, in another surprising fashion play, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos. Typically, the sponsoring brand will bring a few tables’ full of guests, all dressed in their clothes. Bezos and Sánchez Bezos’s financial support marks the couple’s latest move in their quest to evolve from mere cartoon zillionaires to style cognoscenti: In addition to attending the gala in 2024 and posing for the cover of Vogue US,  Sánchez’s Earth Fund recently announced a $6.25 million partnership with the CFDA to promote sustainability in fashion .\n \n\n   \n  The Met Gala, and its less influential though no less opulent exhibition, has become a red carpet machine that is arguably more anticipated and dissected than the Oscars. In a good year, the show and gala inspire the public to think more critically about the purpose and possibility of clothes. Designers jockey for months to dress stars like Rihanna, Zendaya and supermodels in boundary-pushing designs. Some of the museum’s most influential exhibitions, like  2019’s Camp-themed show , or 2011’s tribute to the late Alexander McQueen, have played a hand in making streetstyle and red carpets more outrageous or convincing the public that fashion is a craft on the level of fine art. With its upcoming exhibition and new space, Bolton and the museum are clearly keen to ensure that no one forgets fashion can demand the effort and genius required of a Renaissance masterpiece.\n \n\n   \n  At other times, confusing or milquetoast themes have made the event feel out of touch.  2024’s “Sleeping Beauties,”  which used AI to celebrate the fragility and transient nature of fashion, was too riddled by gimmicky scientific ambitions to illuminate its gowns and flower-trimmed hats, and  the previous year’s tribute to Karl Lagerfeld  neglected to account for the late designer’s controversial reputation.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Met theme was “ Superfine: Tailoring Black Style ,” and marked the first time the museum had focused specifically on the style and designs of Black Americans, and the first to highlight menswear since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  The gala, for which tickets reportedly cost some $75,000, typically raises record funds for the museum: Last year, it brought in a whopping $31 million. The gala is the sole fundraiser for the Costume Institute’s exhibitions, acquisitions and maintenance; unlike other curatorial departments at the Met, the Costume Institute receives no money from the museum’s budget.\n \n\n   \n  As for more gala details and predictions? The content machines at Vogue have their work cut out for them over the next five months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/soccer-trump-world-cup-host-cities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump Muses About What It Would Take to Strip US World Cup Host Cities of Games","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has voiced threats to relocate World Cup 2026 matches from host cities, particularly in Democratic-led areas like Los Angeles and Boston, citing concerns over crime, lack of cooperation from local leaders, and insufficient local preparedness.

If they want help during this, I would love to send in the National Guard or whoever is necessary to help them. I want it to be great. I’d love it to be in Los Angeles. I love the place. It’s a natural for Los Angeles.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “If we think there’s going to be crime, if we are obstructed by the governor – and maybe he won’t obstruct, maybe it’ll be great. But I’d love for him to call and say, ‘You know, we’d like to have some extra (help)’ because if there’s even a hint of a problem, we want to get in there before the problem occurs.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump last month threatened to pull World Cup games  from Boston after mentioning his displeasure  with that city’s Democratic mayor, Michelle Wu.\n \n\n   \n  When asked for specifics on Monday about what it would take for him to try and move matches from host cities, Trump was vague.\n \n\n   \n  “If we think there’s going to be any sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city,” he said. “We have a lot of cities that would love to have it, No. 1, and we’ll do it very safely.”\n \n\n   \n  Reporters asked the president about his threats to pull games and – in an extraordinary moment – turned to Infantino, saying, “But if we think there’s going to be a problem, Gianni, can I say we will move?”\n \n\n   \n  The FIFA president, who has developed a tight relationship with Trump in recent years, declined to enthusiastically back the idea.\n \n\n   \n  “Safety and security is the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup,” Infantino said in response to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We can see today that people have trust in the United States. … They know that they will be coming here, and they will experience a safe and secure World Cup. This is the responsibility, of course, of the government, of (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem, of everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “And obviously we will, I mean, we will discuss. We are working together. We have a task force for this, and we must ensure that all fans coming from abroad or being here – they can experience a celebration of coming together, of the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Moving World Cup games away from a current host city would be an extraordinary decision that has little, if any, precedent in one of the world’s most important sporting events.\n \n\n   \n  The host cities were announced in May 2022, more than four years before the first ball will be kicked in the tournament. The 11 US cities, along with the other host cities in Mexico and Canada, have been spending time and money preparing for the tournament with infrastructure improvements, security planning and extensive plans to host an influx of millions of visitors that will be traveling for the games.\n \n\n   \n  But that agenda is running squarely into Trump’s tactic of sending the National Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies into Democratic-run cities – such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago and others – to crack down on illegal immigration and crime.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed federal presence in cities around the country, including just this past weekend in  Charlotte,  has raised alarm bells for his political opponents who see the operations as oppressive. While they’re nominally meant to crack down on illegal immigration, reports have circulated of US citizens being caught up in federal operations and many community activists have expressed displeasure with the unrequested help.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said his preference would be that Democratic leaders of 2026 World Cup host cities simply invite the National Guard into their cities now.\n \n\n   \n  “If they would tell us now, they’re not gonna have a problem,” Trump said. “Because if we go in, they don’t have a problem.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/world/israeli-settlers-attack-palestinian-west-bank-village-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:01:00Z","title":"Israeli Settlers Torch Palestinian Vehicles and Homes in West Bank Village","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 17, 2025, Israeli settlers attacked the Palestinian village of Jab’a in the West Bank, torching three homes and multiple vehicles after Israeli security forces demolished illegal settler outpost structures near Metzad (Asfar).

The Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders met in the league’s first ever regular season game in Spain.\n \n\n   \n  Playing at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home ground of European  soccer  giant  Real Madrid , the Dolphins prevailed over the Commanders 16-13 in overtime.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured plenty of kicking – an ironic turn of events in the soccer-mad nation – as the Dolphins and Commanders combined for five field goals and just two touchdowns.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, it was a 29-yard kick in OT from Miami’s Riley Patterson that lifted the Dolphins to the win.\n \n\n   \n    Aaron Rodgers exits with injury in contentious rivalry game\n \n\n   \n  In one of the league’s most heated rivalries, the Pittsburgh Steelers blasted the Cincinnati Bengals 34-12 to press their advantage in the AFC North.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers sit atop the division after the victory, seeking their first AFC North crown since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  The win came with a cost, however, as Pittsburgh’s future Hall of Fame quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  left the game at halftime with an injured wrist.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers came down hard on his left, non-throwing wrist while being tackled late in the second quarter. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said after the game that his starting QB will undergo further examination on the wrist on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Later Sunday evening, ESPN’s Adam Schefter  reported  that the team fears that Rodgers has “a slight break” in his left wrist, citing unnamed sources.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers cruised in the second half without the four-time MVP signal-caller thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns and solid play from backup quarterback Mason Rudolph.\n \n\n   \n  Things turned ugly in the fourth quarter after a scuffle broke out between Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey, with Ramsey being ejected from the game for throwing a punch.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Ramsey told reporters the punch was prompted by Chase spitting on him: “He spit on me. I don’t give a f**k after that, respectfully. I’m always gonna be all for trash talking, sh*t talking, stuff like that. I actually enjoy that part of the game.”\n \n\n   \n  Chase denied the accusations while speaking to reporters in the locker room postgame,  saying , “I ain’t ever open my mouth to that guy.\n \n\n   \n  “We were going back and forth the whole time, so I’m sure something got under his skin … I didn’t spit on nobody.”\n \n\n   \n  However,  video  shot by CNN affiliate WXIX does appear to show Chase spit on Ramsey, the second high-profile  spitting incident  in the NFL this season.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the NFL handed Chase a  one-game suspension  without pay over the “act of unsportsmanlike conduct.”\n \n\n   \n    Bills beat Bucs in barnburner\n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two teams seemingly destined for the postseason, the Buffalo Bills emerged victorious after a high-scoring slugfest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n \n\n   \n  The game featured an astonishing nine lead changes, with the Bills ultimately walking away with the 44-32 win.\n \n\n   \n  Reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen improved his chances to lift the award again as he tallied a mind-boggling six touchdowns in the game. The Bills quarterback threw three TDs and also ran for three scores in the thrilling contest.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills needed the win as they try to keep pace with the surprising New England Patriots, who lead the AFC East after a 27-14 victory over the New York Jets on Thursday night.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats haven’t won the division since 2019 when Tom Brady was still under center in New England and look like the real deal this season.\n \n\n   \n    Broncos deal the Chiefs a devastating defeat\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos took firm control of the AFC West with a 22-19 win against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have won the division nine consecutive seasons.\n \n\n   \n  Denver improved to a perfect 6-0 at home this season as the Broncos’ stout defense stymied the Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ lone touchdown on the day was a 21-yard strike to tight end Travis Kelce with just under 10 minutes left in the game to put the Chiefs up three.\n \n\n   \n  The score was Kelce’s 84th touchdown, making him the Chiefs’ all-time TD leader by passing Priest Holmes.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos were powered by the mighty right leg of kicker Wil Lutz, who drilled five field goals in the game – and three in the fourth quarter – including a game-winning 35-yarder as time expired.\n \n\n   \n  After the loss, the Chiefs, who have appeared in three straight Super Bowls and seven straight AFC Championship games, drop to 5-5 on the season and are in serious danger of missing the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The road doesn’t get any easier for the Chiefs either. Next week, Kansas City faces the impressive Indianapolis Colts, who enjoyed a bye this week. Indy is one of the NFL’s biggest surprises this season; with one of the AFC’s best records at 8-2, the Colts are poised to win the AFC South for the first time since 2014.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Broncos now sit two games clear of the Los Angeles Chargers in pursuit of their first division crown since 2015.\n \n\n   \n    Shedeur Sanders makes NFL debut as Browns fall to Ravens\n \n\n   \n  After losing four straight games amid an injury to  quarterback Lamar Jackson , the return of the Baltimore’s two-time league MVP has sparked a four-game winning streak as the Ravens have clawed their way back to .500 and back in the AFC playoff discussion.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens had to rally on Sunday for a 23-16 win against the Cleveland Browns after trailing 13-3 in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  The Browns’ fortunes turned when quarterback Dillon Gabriel was knocked out of the game with a concussion early in the third quarter. The injury set the stage for the NFL debut of 2025 fifth-round draft pick  Shedeur Sanders , son of Hall of Famer  Deion Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Sanders’ first NFL game was a forgettable one, as the 23-year-old went just 4-of-16 passing for 47 yards and one interception.\n \n\n   \n  Tied at 16 late in the fourth quarter, the game was still in doubt until an inspired bit of misdirection just before the two-minute warning gave Baltimore its first lead since the first quarter.\n \n\n   \n  On a 4th & 1, Baltimore lined up in the “ tush push ” formation with tight end Mark Andrews under center. But instead of plowing forward, Andrews took the ball to the right edge and ran untouched for a 35-yard, game-winning touchdown.\n \n\n   \n    Darnold’s 4 INTs doom Seahawks\n \n\n   \n  With the NFC West lead on the line, neither the Seattle Seahawks nor the Los Angeles Rams played their best football.\n \n\n   \n  But in the end, Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold’s four interceptions – two of which led to Rams touchdowns – proved to be the difference in LA’s 21-19 win. Safety Kamren Kinchens hauled in two of the interceptions for LA.\n \n\n   \n  With the win, the Rams take sole possession of first place in the division at 8-2, while the Seahawks fall to 7-3 on the year.\n \n\n   \n    Eagles outlast Lions in defensive struggle\n \n\n   \n  In Sunday’s finale, the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles met the Detroit Lions in one of Week 11’s most anticipated matchups.\n \n\n   \n  The result may not have been pretty at times, but the Eagles escaped with a 16-9 home win in a game dominated by the defenses.\n \n\n   \n  The Eagles’ offense might not be firing like it was during last season’s playoff run, but the team’s certainly sporting a championship-caliber defense. For the second consecutive week, Philly held a playoff contender under 10 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Lions’ loss puts the Chicago Bears alone atop the NFC North after the Bears eked past the Minnesota Vikings 19-17 earlier in the day. Despite a negative point differential on the season, Chicago boasts a 7-3 record as the Monsters of the Midway eye their first division title since 2018.\n \n\n   \n    Full NFL Week 11 Sunday scores\n \n\n   \n   Away @ home (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n  Washington Commanders 13-16 (OT)  Miami Dolphins  (in Madrid, Spain)\n \n\n   \n   Green Bay Packers  27-20 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n   Houston Texans  16-13 Tennessee Titans\n \n\n   \n   Carolina Panthers  30-27 (OT) Atlanta Falcons\n \n\n   \n   Chicago Bears  19-17 Minnesota Vikings\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers 6-35  Jacksonville Jaguars \n \n\n   \n  Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-44  Buffalo Bills \n \n\n   \n  Cincinnati Bengals 12-34  Pittsburgh Steelers \n \n\n   \n   San Francisco 49ers  41-22 Arizona Cardinals\n \n\n   \n  Seattle Seahawks 19-21  Los Angeles Rams \n \n\n   \n  Kansas City Chiefs 19-22  Denver Broncos \n \n\n   \n   Baltimore Ravens  23-16 Cleveland Browns\n \n\n   \n  Detroit Lions 9-16  Philadelphia Eagles \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/entertainment/rebecca-gayheart-eric-dane-als-diagnosis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00Z","title":"Rebecca Gayheart Discusses Parenting Challenges Amid Eric Dane’s ALS Diagnosis","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rebecca Gayheart, former wife of actor Eric Dane, discusses the emotional and parenting challenges she faces as Dane is diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure.

cut the engines  of a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit will serve no prison time, a federal judge ruled Monday, bringing an end to a case that drew attention to the need for more mental health support for pilots.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Amy Baggio sentenced Joseph Emerson to credit for time served and supervised release for three years at a hearing in Portland, Oregon. Federal prosecutors had asked for one year in prison, while his attorneys had sought probation.\n \n\n   \n  “Pilots are not perfect. They are human,” she said. “They are people and all people need help sometimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.\n \n\n   \n  After his arrest, Emerson  told police  he was despondent over a friend’s recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn’t slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.\n \n\n   \n  Baggio said it “offers a cautionary tale worth telling beyond the confines of this case.”\n \n\n   \n  Before she announced the sentence, Emerson spoke and said he regretted the harm he caused to society.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a victim. I am here as a direct result of my actions,” he told the court. “I can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.”\n \n\n   \n  He hugged his attorneys and shared a tearful embrace with his wife after the judge announced his sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people spoke on Emerson’s behalf at the hearing, including his wife, Sarah Stretch, who told the judge how the incident had impacted their family.\n \n\n   \n  “I am so sorry for those that it’s impacted as much as it has. But I am extremely proud to be here with this man today, because the growth that he has had from this terrible experience has not only helped him, but benefited all that surround him,” she said through tears. “I just hope people realize that it’s not necessarily the mistake itself but how you respond to it. He has responded with courage, strength and demonstration of extreme resiliency.”\n \n\n   \n  Emerson had pleaded guilty or no-contest to all charges against him in September as part of agreements with state and federal prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Emerson, of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft. He was released from custody pending trial in December 2023, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  A state court sentenced him to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, 664 hours of community service — eight hours for each person he endangered — and over $60,000 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group.\n \n\n   \n  Half of his community service can be performed at the  pilot health nonprofit  he founded after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any unprescribed drugs, and keep at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer.\n \n\n   \n  In their sentencing memo asking for one year in prison, federal prosecutors wrote: “It was only through the heroic actions of the flight crew, who were able to physically restrain the defendant and restore normal operations of the aircraft, that no lives were lost that day.”\n \n\n   \n  In a sentencing memo, his attorneys requested probation with credit for time served over prison or home detention, arguing that the “robust” state prosecution “resulted in substantial punishment.”\n \n\n   \n  In state court in September, Emerson said he was grateful to the flight crew for restraining him and saving his life, along with those of everyone else on board. He called it “the greatest gift I ever got,” even though he lost his career and wound up in jail, because it forced him to confront his mental health challenges and reliance on alcohol.\n \n\n   \n  “This difficult journey has made me a better father, a better husband, a better member of my community,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.\n \n\n   \n  The averted disaster renewed attention on  cockpit safety  and the  mental fitness  of those allowed in them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/soviet-union-refugee-deported-ukraine-immigration","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:19:00-05:00","title":"Roman Surovtsev: Father Facing Deportation to War-Torn Ukraine After 20-Year Legal Battle","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Roman Surovtsev, a former Soviet refugee who fled Ukraine at age four and built a life in the United States, is facing deportation to Ukraine in November 2025 despite having complied with all immigration rules for over a decade.

to the US as a child refugee from the former Soviet Union. Now he’s a father facing deportation to Ukraine \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:19 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roman Surovtsev was prompt in picking up his two daughters from school every afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to him to be there for his smiley 3- and 5-year-old girls, peppering them with questions about what they learned and who they played with.\n \n\n   \n  At home with his wife, Samantha, he would always be facilitating the bubbles at bath time, meticulously brushing out tiny blonde and brunette ponytails, and tucking the giggling girls into bed after reading to them.\n \n\n   \n  But giggles have grown quiet as the young girls wonder what happened to their loving dad, who, in their eyes, simply vanished this summer. The girls haven’t seen him in 107 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on August 1, and never came home.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s legal troubles stem from an armed carjacking conviction more than 20 years ago that cost him his permanent resident status after his release in 2014. His attorneys have since vacated that conviction, and he is close to regaining his green card, but deportation is set to proceed before a judge can rule on his case.\n \n\n   \n  Now, it’s unclear when his family will see him again as the father of two learned just days ago of his imminent deportation on Monday to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war, and one he hasn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union.\n \n\n   \n  His detainment stems from President Donald Trump’s determination to arrest and deport undocumented  migrants en masse  – an effort  fracturing families  across the country as  communities watch  their workers, schoolchildren and church members be swept up by ICE.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev had never so much as skipped an event at the girls’ school before missing his oldest daughter’s 5th birthday later in August. He was still absent for his wife’s birthday a month later, then their wedding anniversary, and soon to be the holidays – Surovtsev’s favorite time of year to spend with his family.\n \n\n   \n  Samantha has been telling her young daughters their dad is at work, and gave their oldest a locket with his picture inside after he was detained. She’s been wearing it more often in recent days, her mother said, asking the photo inside, “Daddy, come home.”\n \n\n   \n  “They’re too little to understand, and there’s no way to tell them without making them fearful of their own country,” Samantha said through tears. She and the girls have been living on savings as they accumulate attorney fees, and she said she feels like she’s going through life as a single mom.\n \n\n   \n  In a court filing on Wednesday, the Department of Justice confirmed it has arranged for Surovtsev to be removed to Ukraine on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an  X post  Monday that Surovtsev is a “criminal illegal alien with a history of violence,” including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and carjacking.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys say 82 other immigrants will be on Surovtsev’s flight with the same fate, and fear for their safety in wartime Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m afraid that my life will be taken in this war, and my girls are going to have to grow up without their dad, my wife is going to have to be a widow, and I myself will lose my life in a war that I know nothing about,” Surovtsev said in a video reviewed by CNN his wife recorded during one of his calls to her from detention.\n \n\n   \n    Surovtsev found love, work and God after escaping Soviet rule\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was born in the USSR city of Zhdanov – which has since been renamed Mariupol in present-day Ukraine – in 1984. After his father, a Chernobyl nuclear power plant worker, died from radiation poisoning after it  exploded , Surovtsev fled the USSR at 4 years old with his mother and two siblings.\n \n\n   \n  The family came to the US lawfully, forfeiting their USSR citizenship, and slept in a San Francisco church for six months before settling further north in Sacramento, court filings show. But poverty followed them across California.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was a young child when he began stealing small toys in an effort to hide that his family was poor, court filings show, and he was around 7 years old when he started helping his mother work by cleaning homes and law offices. What followed was a boyhood marked by struggles to get by in his adopted country.\n \n\n   \n  In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014. Following his sentence, an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported, costing him his green card. He was placed into ICE custody but ultimately released by the US government on an order of supervision, after it determined it wasn’t likely he would be removed from the country anytime soon, and in that case, continued detention would be unlawful, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Without USSR citizenship or a green card, Surovtsev has since lived his life as a  stateless person  with a work permit, routinely checking in with ICE. He’s never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers said in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  As his family found relief from Soviet rule in the United States, Surovtsev also found love, gratifying work, and God.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Surovtsev was baptized in prison. When he came to Christ, everything changed, his wife said. He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County. The two married, bought a home in a suburb north of Dallas, started a painting business together and welcomed their two girls.\n \n\n   \n  “He created a life here, and he’s being ripped away from it,” she said. “The person he is on paper is not the person he is now. Twenty years have passed since he committed that crime and a lot of life has been lived.”\n \n\n   \n  Between juggling the family business and raising his daughters, Surovtsev was training to be part of a prison ministry where he could travel to jails offering religious services and support for detainees.\n \n\n   \n  Then, he was detained himself.\n \n\n   \n  At the Bluebonnet and Prairieland Detention Facilities in Texas, where he has been held since August, Surovtsev’s faith hasn’t wavered, his wife said. He leads a nightly Bible study with his fellow inmates.\n \n\n   \n  Since he anticipates boarding a flight to Ukraine Monday, the group held an extra session this weekend to rally around him in prayer one more time.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday, the US government plans to deport 83 people to Ukraine where they will be conscripted into the army and likely killed. Ukraine is a police state where the population lives under martial law,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Eric Lee and Chris Godshall-Bennett said in an emailed statement.\n \n\n   \n  Neither DHS nor the Ukrainian Embassy responded to CNN requests for comment on the flight to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Among the detainees are individuals who have lived in the US since they were kids. Many have US citizen spouses and children,” the lawyers wrote. “Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country.”\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev does not speak or read Ukrainian. Having fled at such a young age, Surovtsev has very little memory of the former Soviet town where he was born, his wife said.\n \n\n   \n  Surovtsev’s birthplace, present-day Mariupol, Ukraine, has endured some of the most  devastating strikes and sieges  from Russia during the war. The city’s infrastructure and housing were  almost entirely destroyed , civilians suffer from  starvation , and thousands have been killed or displaced. Despite reconstruction efforts being promoted by  Russian authorities , the city remains heavily damaged.\n \n\n   \n    Lawyers say Surovtsev is close to regaining his green card status\n \n\n   \n  The US government had run into trouble trying to deport Surovtsev before.\n \n\n   \n  Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents.\n \n\n   \n  Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six weeks. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual.\n \n\n   \n  “Often when he met with officers, he was told that ICE had made a new attempt to contact the embassy of either Ukraine, Russia or both, but that either or both governments had refused to grant him travel documents,” his lawyers wrote in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans. But on August 1, he was unexpectedly detained, and an officer refused to accept his stay of removal from his immigration counsel who accompanied him to the appointment, his lawyers write in court filings.\n \n\n   \n  But now it’s unclear what documentation Ukraine may have for Surovtsev’s deportation or what changed from a decade ago, when the country couldn’t prove his citizenship.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2014 and 2015, ICE tried and failed to deport Mr. Surovtsev to Ukraine when the Ukrainian consulate told them it couldn’t prove he was a citizen,” Lee, the attorney, said in a statement. “Now we are told Ukraine is giving ‘temporary passports’ to detainees, whatever that means. To this day Ukraine has never acknowledged Mr. Surovtsev is a citizen.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s always complied, but we knew that maybe something would be different this year, just because of what was going on with this immigration crackdown,” his wife said. “We didn’t think that this would be our reality.”\n \n\n   \n  His detainment mobilized Samantha, when she said she became his “assistant full-time” as she tirelessly drafted a legal team to get him out.\n \n\n   \n  His attorneys successfully vacated Surovtsev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, and will have him plead to a lesser charge that doesn’t have immigration consequences.\n \n\n   \n  This change in circumstances would justify reopening his case, which his team has filed for, Surovtsev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said, and Surovtsev’s lawful permanent resident status would be restored if a judge agreed to dismiss it.\n \n\n   \n  All his family and legal team can do is wait for the case to be heard, but it sits in a heavy queue of similar motions. There is no expedited process at the immigration court level, Rozdzielski said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a result of securing post-conviction relief for a past crime, he is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active warzone,” Surovtsev’s attorneys Lee and Godshall-Bennett said.\n \n\n   \n  The flight to Ukraine is poised to take off before a judge could make any new rulings. The motion was filed on November 4, and his attorney estimates a two- to three-month timeline.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family, our community and our country is not better off with him gone,” Samantha said. “Even if he’s remaining in detention, we just want time for our case to be heard. That’s all we want.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/style/jennifer-lawrence-sothebys-jewels-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:50:00Z","title":"Look of the Week: The best luxury ad space?

of the Week: The best luxury ad space? Jennifer Lawrence’s earlobes \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:50 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On Sunday, Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles, part movie star, part walking advert. Her white silk dress, draped across her chest in an off-the-shoulder style with a cascading leg split, was designed by Jonathan Anderson for Dior — the French luxury label for which she has been a brand ambassador since 2012.\n \n\n   \n  Many celebrities have ambassadorship roles with big brands, and are often contractually obliged to wear their designs on the red carpets and other major events. See Margaret Qualley, who often wears Chanel (much to the dismay of some social media users) since becoming brand ambassador in 2022, while longtime Louis Vuitton face Emma Stone has almost exclusively worn clothes by the French luxury house since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  But Dior isn’t the only brand that Lawrence was advertising in her recent outing. In her ears were a pair of 1987 diamond clips shaped like glittering tree branches. Designed by the American jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, they were worth between $300,000 and $500,000. The cost is an estimate, because these earrings are scheduled to go on auction next month at Sotheby’s in New York, where their price will be determined by a bidding war — presumably between some people who may have enjoyed seeing them on Lawrence first. In the same auction are several more of Rosenthal’s pieces, as well as a 1930s ruby and diamond bracelet from Cartier and a late 19th century necklace by Boucheron, worth between $1 and $2 million.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t the first time Lawrence has acted as ad space for Sotheby’s. Earlier this month, the auction house lent her an 18-karat gold, platinum and enamel necklace by jeweler David Webb worth between $25,000 and $35,000 ahead of its scheduled auction on December 11. The actor wore the necklace to the New York premiere of “Die My Love,” her latest high-profile film with Robert Pattinson.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s has lent jewels to celebrities including Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Rihanna in the past, for the 2023 and 2021 Met Gala, respectively, with the diamond Chopra Jonas wore selling for CHF 22 million (over $27 million) days later. Lawrence, meanwhile, is making sure soon-to-be-auctioned pieces are being seen beyond the first Monday in May.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s decision to engage with fashion marketing playbook’s may help to offset a slumped high-end art market. According to 2025  data  from ArtTactic, a research firm specializing in the art market, auction sales at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips declined for the third year in a row, as ongoing inflation and rising geopolitical tensions have created a more cautious environment among investors.\n \n\n   \n  Now, in a move that is considerably agile for a 281-year-old auction house, Sotheby’s is making use of a famous face that could potentially entice new audiences. Jewels worn by celebrities have proven to drive interest (and sales) — take the influential singer Shirley Bassey’s collection of treasures, which broke a world-record when the entire lot sold in a Paris auction for €2.2 million (around $2.5 million). Could Sotheby’s recreate some of that magic by lending lesser-known auction lots to top-of-their-game actors? When the gavel comes down next month, we’ll find out if the star power rubbed off on the final sales price.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/meat-cleaver-on-plane","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:07:00Z","title":"TSA Investigating How a Meat Cleaver Made It Onto a Plane in Portland","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is investigating how a meat cleaver was smuggled onto a Delta Air Lines flight from Portland International Airport to Salt Lake City on November 17, 2025.

\n        1:58 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists say they have for the first time unlocked how a parasitic ant uses chemical warfare to take over the nest of a different species, by tricking workers into an unlikely assassination.\n \n\n   \n  The deadly scheme unfolds like a Shakespearean drama. In an ant colony, the queen is dying, under attack by her own daughters. Meanwhile, the true enemy — an invader queen from another ant species — waits on the sidelines. Her plan is simple: Infiltrate the nest and use chemical weapons brewed inside her body to deceive the worker ants into mistaking their rightful ruler for an imposter.\n \n\n   \n  In a few hours, the nest’s queen will fall. Once the former matriarch is dead, the invader will assume the role of the colony’s new leader.\n \n\n   \n  Matricide in an ant colony is not unheard of — it typically happens when a colony produces multiple queens or when a solo queen reaches the end of her fertility. But this particular scenario, in which an outsider queen turns workers into her proxy assassins, has never been described in detail before, researchers reported Monday  in the journal  Current Biology .\n \n\n   \n  In fact, this strategy is yet to be documented in any other animal species, said the study’s senior author Dr. Keizo Takasuka, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Kyushu in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  “Inducement of daughters to kill their biological mother had not been known in biology before this work,” Takasuka told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers observed this behavior among ants in the Lasius genus, documenting invasions and worker manipulation by queens in the species L. orientalis and L. umbratus.\n \n\n   \n  “Prior studies had reported that, after a new L. umbratus queen invaded a host colony of L. niger, host workers killed their own queen,” Takasuka said. “But the mechanism remained entirely unknown until our study.”\n \n\n   \n    Scent of a worker ant\n \n\n   \n  Ants communicate through smell, which is how they distinguish between nestmates and foes. When researchers previously observed parasitic ant queens near a colony’s foraging trails, they saw that the parasite would snatch up a worker ant and rub it on her body, disguising her scent and allowing her to slip into the nest undetected.\n \n\n   \n  For the new study, coauthors Taku Shimada and Yuji Tanaka — both citizen scientists in Tokyo — each raised an ant colony and introduced parasitic queens. Shimada observed an L. orientalis queen in an L. flavus colony, and Tanaka recorded an L. umbratus queen invading a colony of L. japonicus.\n \n\n   \n  In both experiments, the scientists first co-housed an invading queen with host workers and cocoons “so that she acquired the nestmate odour,” Takasuka said. “This allowed her to gain nestmate recognition and avoid retaliation upon entry.” The scientists then released the queen into the colony.\n \n\n   \n  Both parasite queens followed a similar plan of attack. After disguising their smell, the queens entered the colonies’ feeding areas. Most workers ignored the interloper. Some even fed her mouth-to-mouth.\n \n\n   \n  But the invading queens weren’t there for dinner — they had an assassination to set in motion. After locating the resident queen, the invader sprayed her with abdominal fluid that smelled of formic acid. The scent agitated workers, with some of them turning on their queen immediately and attacking her. Multiple sprays followed, and the attacks became more brutal.\n \n\n   \n  “The host workers eventually mutilated their true mother after four days,” the scientists reported.\n \n\n   \n    All in the family\n \n\n   \n  The death of the true queen was the invader’s cue to start producing hundreds of eggs, attended by her newly adopted “daughters.” Over time, her biological daughters would number in the thousands, usurping the colony until none of the original species remained.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s refreshing to see a very careful observational study that discovers something interesting that we — ‘we’ meaning ant researchers — suspected but had never confirmed,” said Dr. Jessica Purcell, a professor in the department of entomology at the University of California, Riverside.\n \n\n   \n  “I was really struck by this discovery, especially the use of a chemical compound to elicit that behavior by the workers,” said Purcell, who was not involved in the research.\n \n\n   \n  Social insects like ants gather and store resources for the colony to share. That makes them an attractive target for social parasites — species seeking well-stocked nests that they can exploit. Some ant species  kidnap the colony’s offspring   and enslave them. Others, such as L. orientalis and L. umbratus, set up shop in the colony, where they eliminate the existing queen and take her place.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s all of this amazing diversity,” Purcell told CNN. “What we didn’t know a lot about before this study, is the various ways that socially parasitic queens might go about assassinating the host queen. People had done some observations of direct killing where the infiltrating queen would go and cut off the head of the existing queen. But this is astonishing that they can actually use chemical manipulation to cause the workers to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Violence within families is often described in fairy tales and myths, with wicked adults — typically desperate parents or jealous stepparents — conspiring to harm or kill children. Rapunzel is imprisoned in a tower; Snow White is hunted and then poisoned by an apple; Hansel and Gretel are abandoned in the forest and captured by a witch, who imprisons them and fattens Hansel for her supper.\n \n\n   \n  But while such stories include plenty of violence, the killing of a mother in folklore — let alone children being tricked into matricide — is almost nonexistent, said Dr. Maria Tatar, a professor emerita of folklore and mythology at Harvard University who was not involved in the new study.\n \n\n   \n  In that respect, Takasuka noted, the grim tale of the invading, manipulative ant queens stands out even more.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes, phenomena in nature outstrip what we imagine in fiction,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/americas/analysis-trump-military-action-venezuela-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00-05:00","title":"Whatever Trump’s goal in Venezuela, US military action is unlikely to achieve it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the potential for U.S. military action under the Trump administration against Venezuela, questioning whether such actions—ranging from targeted airstrikes to land invasions—would achieve any meaningful strategic goals.

in Venezuela, US military action is unlikely to achieve it \n       \n  Analysis by Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:29 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the vacillating contours of US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, little should surprise. And outlying moments of apparent success against  Iran’s nuclear program  (even if short-lived), are uneasily partnered with moments of fleeting fancy, like  seizing Greenland  (remember that?)\n \n\n   \n  But the looming possibility of  military action against Venezuela  – across a wide spectrum of violent options – drags the White House into realms of foreign involvement it has always said it loathed. And it puts it squarely in opposition to the lessons of the past two decades of US Republican military endeavors, and plenty of decades of regional experience before that.\n \n\n   \n  Just what exactly does the Trump administration want to do here, and how long does it think it will take to achieve? These are two questions an administration conventionally seeks to publicly and painstakingly lay out the answers to before military action. But it remains mired in confusion. And the variables do not look good.\n \n\n   \n  The most slender goal of military action is to stop drug trafficking. Yet this is something exceptionally hard to achieve with targeted strikes. Firstly, Venezuela is  not the hub of narco-trafficking : that is a route which begins in neighboring Colombia, and ends on the US border in Mexico. Venezuela has been a facilitator, even permitting its territory to be used to launch the planes that carry Colombian cocaine north, and harboring depots and processing plants which operate in a climate of greater impunity than in Colombia. But it is at worst a tenth of the problem, not its heart.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, the drug trade is so unspeakably profitable, no kinetic activity can really stop it. The incentives are simply too great. Consider the planes that fly north from Venezuela – booming during the first Trump term, using 50 covert runways in Venezuela’s Zulia region to move their packages to central America for onward transportation, according to Colombian officials.\n \n\n   \n  Each plane makes the trip once, and as we saw across  Honduras’ Moskitia coastline in 2019 , is abandoned in the bush. The money to be made from its cargo is in the tens of millions, while the plane is worth only about $150,000, so it is logically dumped rather than used again, decreasing the risk of capture. This is the mindset of trafficking: there is truly little couriers would not do for their part of millions of dollars, for a few weeks’ risky work. And there is too much product to get too anxious: one official told me then of how these tiny planes, when they feared interception at sea, would simply throw their cargo overboard and pay local fisherman $150,000 to return the cocaine to them.\n \n\n   \n  Traffickers have since turned to boats – and even unmanned submersibles guided by Starlink satellite internet dishes – to evade capture. A concerted US bombing campaign can at best hope to disrupt this sort of extraordinary profiteering. But you cannot kill the business unless you kill the demand feeding it in the United States itself.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is the question of affordability for the United States. The Pentagon used to be concerned about putting an expensive “warhead on the forehead” of jihadist militants a decade ago. It is wildly inefficient to send a million-dollar missile to incinerate raw cocaine, so close to source that it has yet to earn anywhere near its eventual US street value. Colombia is currently close to record cocaine production, according to the UN, so there is no shortage of powder to try to move.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration can set back, inconvenience, delay or even hamper, drug trafficking in the region. But Venezuela is not its main source, and there will always be poor, disadvantaged young men there, or in Colombia, Ecuador or Bolivia, willing to step into any vacancy left by US drone strikes.\n \n\n   \n  So what if regime change is the goal? To “shock and awe” Venezuela’s fragile and economically beleaguered authoritarian, Nicolas Maduro, into fleeing? A series of pinpoint airstrikes could destroy key assets in  Venezuela’s military  – its runways, air defenses, Su-30 attack jets, and Russian T-72 tanks. But military action is already being  discussed publicly , giving Maduro plenty of warning to move his most prized equipment, including his political hierarchy, and even himself.\n \n\n   \n  The most technologically advanced military power in history still has limitations. It may have been able to kill al Qaeda’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, using a missile equipped with spinning blades on a balcony in Kabul in 2022. But it was unable to stop its humiliating ousting from the same city a year earlier, by a far inferior Taliban force.\n \n\n   \n  US policy needs popular support from the people it is being imposed upon, and that is rarely achieved from a missile launch at 30,000 feet. In Iraq, even the tortured and false arguments amassed to remove the vile butcher Saddam Hussein ran into an Iraqi people who widely rejected occupation at the barrel of an M4 assault rifle. Many Serbians were angered by NATO bombing in 1999, even though the source of their woes, Slobodan Milosevic, was defenestrated a year later.\n \n\n   \n  Looming US action in Venezuela is beset with so many historical comparables because the US has tried this so many times before. Indeed, the one thing the US might try to foment – a popular revolt to install a more friendly government – Trump has  tried before  too.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a brief call to insurrection tried to start a military coup of sorts that seemed to aim to replace Maduro. It fell utterly flat, and I recall arriving in Caracas to scenes of underwhelming calm. The plot had barely rattled Maduro. And that was after months of intense US and Colombian pressure, in which Juan Guaido – a relatively popular reformist leader who had won recent legislative elections – presented the country with an alternative, internationally recognized government-in-waiting, ready to go.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has tried before to shake Caracas so hard that Maduro would topple, but he failed. Whatever the fate of Maduro, any repeat bid at regime change needs to be sure what follows is actually in US interests, and not a more aggressive subordinate in Maduro’s place.\n \n\n   \n  And what of the favorite canard of US military policy: the land invasion? Dropping thousands of young Americans into an angry coastal nation of 30 million, twice the size of California, is the polar opposite of Trump’s obsession with Nobel Prizes for ending wars, and lessening the US global footprint.\n \n\n   \n  It is logistically suicidal with the mere 15,000 US troops currently amassed in the region. And it would stir the acid-reflux echo of the  Bay of Pigs , where the US tried to oust a similarly leftist dictator in Cuba, in a botched operation that has become a by-word for damaging CIA overreach in the Americas.\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to evaluate the Trump administration’s goals as it has been purposefully opaque with them. But across their spectrum, it will find an adversary wildly more incentivized to adapt and continue, or options for regime change that have failed in the past 25 years, or even in their first term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s hope is perhaps that the sound and fury – if this is not itself the goal of the operation – will signify enough that Maduro makes a deal to flee alive.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump’s officials run into a contradiction of their own policy here. If Maduro is the kingpin trafficker and narco-terrorist they say he is, then surely his decisions about fleeing are complicated by this role, rather than simplified? There will surely be powerful and violent people who need him to stay on.\n \n\n   \n  Wherever Trump has secretly landed in his policy decisions, he may soon learn it is hard to send the guns home without using them, and perhaps harder still to know what to do with them once they have fired.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/uk/britain-asylum-reform-shabana-mahmood-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Britain announces ‘most significant’ change to asylum rules in years, setting Europe’s longest route to settlement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, has announced the most significant overhaul of its asylum policy in decades, making refugee status temporary and extending the path to permanent settlement from five years to 20 years.

Europe’s longest route to settlement \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:03 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Britain  plans to carry out the most significant reform of its asylum policy in modern times by making refugee status temporary and quadrupling the wait for permanent settlement to 20 years, as the  Labour government  confronts a “broken” asylum system that has fueled support for right-wing parties.\n \n\n   \n  After a summer of protests outside  hotels  housing asylum seekers, a mass anti-immigration demonstration in  London , and constant criticism from the surging hard-right  Reform UK party , the government unveiled plans to curb illegal small-boat crossings from France and return refugees to their home countries when it is safe to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain’s asylum system – created in the wake of World War II – was not designed to cope with modern flows of people across a conflict-ridden world.\n \n\n   \n  “The world has changed. It is more volatile and insecure,” Starmer said Monday. “The result is a severe strain on both our asylum system and our wider social contract.” He insisted that Britain remains a “decent, compassionate, tolerant country,” but said demonstrating control of borders is an “essential task of government.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood had previously teased the measures in a weekend media blitz.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a system that is out of control,” she told the BBC on Sunday. “It’s unfair, and it’s putting huge pressure on communities. It is important that we restore order and control to this system, so that we can retain public permission and public confidence in having an asylum system at all.”\n \n\n   \n  The government’s plan has three main prongs. First, ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. Under the changes, a refugee’s status will now be reviewed every two-and-a-half years during a 20-year wait before they can apply for permanent settlement.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said this measure will upend the “generations-old assumption” that sanctuary provided to refugees can quickly lead to settled status “and all of the rights that go alongside that.”\n \n\n   \n  “If your country becomes safe in the intervening period… you will be returned to your country,” Mahmood stressed. Those who arrive legally will also face a 10-year pathway to permanent settlement, double the current wait.\n \n\n   \n  Second, housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also have their support withdrawn. Mahmood said: “It is not fair if British citizens and long-term residents in this country have to follow one set of rules and comply, and another group of people – who also have the right to work – get away with not complying.”\n \n\n   \n  Third, the government will narrow the way that British courts interpret Article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees all people the right to a family life. But the government said that people using wider familial links as a reason to stay in or bring others to Britain is leading to “high numbers of arrivals” from those who would not otherwise have the right to live in the country. The government wants to stipulate that “family connections” must refer to immediate family members.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, Jonathan Sumption, a former UK Supreme Court judge, warned that if Britain interprets one of the articles in a different way to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, it could be judged to be in violation of the treaty. Sumption said the conflict poses a “constitutional problem” for the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The new policy takes inspiration from Denmark’s approach, one of the toughest in Europe. But Britain is now poised to go further: The new 20-year route would make Britain’s path to settlement the longest in Europe, followed by Denmark’s eight-year process.\n \n\n   \n  Since winning a landslide election in 2024, Labour has tried to tread a line between showing competence in tackling illegal immigration, without alienating its more progressive voter base which favors a more compassionate approach.\n \n\n   \n   Both sides have been left alienated:  Right-wing voters support the more drastic measures proposed by Nigel Farage, the firebrand leader of Reform UK, while many on the left have been alarmed by Labour’s tough talk.\n \n\n   \n  But Mahmood, herself the daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, said she rejected “the idea that dealing with this problem is somehow engaging with far-right talking points.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart. It is dividing communities. People can see huge pressure in their communities and they can also see a system that is broken, and where people are able to flout the rules, abuse the system, and get away with it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The Home Secretary also criticized the previous Conservative government for wasting time and public funds in its failed efforts to tackle illegal immigration. The Conservatives passed a contentious bill allowing the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be processed by the East African nation, but Mahmood said this cost £700 million ($920) and saw only four people deported – all volunteers.\n \n\n   \n  In a measure of the hardening of Britain’s debate around immigration, other mainstream parties did not forcefully criticize Labour’s plans. Chris Philp, who used to be a Conservative Home Office minister, told the BBC his party would support the new measures if they are “sensible,” while claiming the measures aren’t “radical” enough.\n \n\n   \n  Ed Davey, leader of the more progressive Liberal Democrats, also said Labour is right to announce asylum measures to “tackle the chaos.”\n \n\n   \n    The Denmark model\n \n\n   \n  The UK’s new policy draws inspiration from Denmark and other European countries where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration is expected.\n \n\n   \n  In a video on X, Mahmood said she was taking action because asylum claims are rising in Britain despite falling across other parts of Europe. “In the last four years, 400,000 people claimed asylum here,” she said. “Over 100,000 are housed and supported at taxpayers’ expense, putting huge pressure on local communities.”\n \n\n   \n  The Home Office says that Denmark’s policies have reduced asylum claims there to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of rejected applicants. Earlier this year, a UK delegation of senior Home Office officials visited the capital of Copenhagen to study Denmark’s approach to asylum, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  However, its reforms have  drawn significant criticism , with rights groups saying the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  Britain’s Refugee Council criticized the government’s new policy announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “People who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars are not ‘asylum shopping’… refugees don’t compare asylum systems before running for their lives,” the group wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  “We know why people come to the UK: because they already have family here, they speak some English, or they have long-standing ties that help them rebuild their lives in safety,” the group added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/reverse-course-trump-epstein-files-release-weakness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:52:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Epstein files capitulation betrays a rare weakness","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump reversed his long-standing opposition to releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files after significant pressure from Republican lawmakers and public demand, marking a rare moment of political weakness.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Jeffrey Epstein files saga is far from over, even after President Donald Trump  suddenly reversed himself  Sunday night and told Republicans to vote for releasing them.\n \n\n   \n  But regardless of how it shakes out, the drama around the files has punctured Trump’s aura of invincibility within the MAGA movement in a way few, if any, things have before. And it has proved a massive unforced political error by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The man who has for a decade dominated his base and told  it  what to care about has backed down when that base decided its priorities didn’t align with his own.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a remarkable political moment — and an unfortuitous one for Trump, particularly right now.\n \n\n   \n    The reversal, and where it leaves us\n \n\n   \n  The big news overnight was that Trump seemed to relent after months of fighting an effort in the House to force the release of all Epstein files from the Justice Department. A significant number of Republicans had been expected to defect from Trump’s opposition to releasing the files in this week’s vote.\n \n\n   \n  “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” Trump  posted on social media , “and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’”\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that this isn’t the end of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Trump has a way of changing his mind. For two, the bill would still need to pass in the Senate — where Majority Leader John Thune  was noncommittal  on Monday — and be signed by Trump, though it’s hard to see how the president and Senate Republicans could resist those things now. And lastly, the  investigations Trump ordered last week of political foes  tied to Epstein could seemingly give the Justice Department a pretext not to release all the files.\n \n\n   \n  But it would be hard for even the president’s allies not to see through that, given Trump’s own  DOJ said in July  there was no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s reversal is a significant moment politically, because it suggests he is throwing in the towel on something he’s fought for months.\n \n\n   \n  While he cast his new posture as being in line with his prior comments on the matter, it’s a clear capitulation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have fought tooth and nail against the discharge petition that ultimately forced this vote. Trump last week threatened Republicans who signed on to it, calling them “stupid” and accusing them of playing into Democrats’ hands. The Epstein files were the central issue in Trump’s recent  rift with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia . And it’s possible he was about to see 100 or more Republicans bucking him on it in the House, according to estimates in recent days.\n \n\n   \n    For once, Trump succumbed to his own base\n \n\n   \n  Trump will likely pretend this wasn’t a rebuke of him personally. But it was. And it’s a pretty remarkable one at that.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past decade, he has fashioned a Republican Party that was largely about one thing: Trump. Whatever he said, went. It didn’t matter if the idea flew in the face of decades of conservative orthodoxy. It didn’t matter what Republican lawmakers previously espoused. It didn’t matter if Trump seemed to be making it up on the fly or breaking the law in the process. It didn’t matter if he was basing the policy on a series of fabrications. The unquestioning faith he garnered from his base was immense.\n \n\n   \n  Congressional Republicans have  rarely voted against Trump’s position ; when they have, it’s almost always been on foreign policy matters.\n \n\n   \n  But the Epstein files saga has shown that the base’s willingness to abide Trump has its limits — or at least, it does when the base feels strongly enough and when the president’s political capital starts to wane.\n \n\n   \n    What it portends for Trump\n \n\n   \n  That’s what’s particularly inauspicious for the president right now. It isn’t just his retreat, but the circumstances and timing of it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and there was no smoking gun in the thousands of documents released last week from the Epstein estate. But there’s no question that the revelations — about what Trump knew about the convicted sex offender and when — have been bad for him politically. Those include  emails  in which Epstein said Trump “knew about the girls” Ghislaine Maxwell recruited from Mar-a-Lago, and that Trump spent hours with Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre at Epstein’s house.\n \n\n   \n  Despite this looking bad for Trump, many congressional Republicans had apparently decided releasing the full files from the DOJ simply wasn’t something they could vote against. Unlike so many other things, they couldn’t ignore what their base has long been clamoring for in the service of Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most important about Trump’s capitulation, politically speaking, is the timing. It’s a sign of weakness at a very bad time.\n \n\n   \n  The context of all of this is the   apparent fracturing   of the MAGA base .\n \n\n   \n  That base is arguing over how hard to root out the growing racism and antisemitism in its ranks. Some elements are expressing unease with  how truly “America First”  some facets of Trump’s agenda are — things like bailing out Argentina and threatening to go to war with Venezuela. Others are concerned about how cozy Trump has been with Big Tech.\n \n\n   \n  And the Greene episode has proved a bigger headache for Trump than perhaps anyone anticipated. That’s in large part because, unlike the many moderate Republicans who have bucked him in the past, the Georgia Republican is hitting back against him rather than objecting and meekly fading away. She’s also doing so from a position of credibility with the base.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend we saw a number of prominent MAGA and MAGA-adjacent influencers on social media start to distance themselves from Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Greene seems in some ways to be giving portions of the MAGA base the permission structure to more forcefully object to things they were  previously quietly uneasy about .\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps not coincidentally, this is also playing out at a time when Trump’s political capital is at a low point.\n \n\n   \n  Republican losses on Election Day this month reinforced Trump’s looming lame-duck status and  crystallized the GOP’s very real problems  in a post-Trump political world, given the party almost always loses when he’s not on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Given all of that, it shouldn’t be too surprising that some Republicans are trying to figure out what the next chapter looks like and perhaps turn the page on Trump in certain ways. And perhaps on no issue is distancing from Trump an easier call than on the Epstein files;  recent polling  showed Americans disapprove of his administration’s handling of the files 3-to-1 and that 77% want all the files released.\n \n\n   \n  As these numbers show, Trump put congressional Republicans in an impossible position by asking them to toe his line. But it’s still significant that so many of them, for once, actually forced  his  hand.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/africa/gunmen-kidnap-schoolgirls-nigeria-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00.000-05:00","title":"Gunmen kidnap 25 schoolgirls from Nigerian school, kill vice principal","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gunmen attacked a government girls’ boarding school in Maga town, Kebbi State, Nigeria, early on Monday, killing vice principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku and abducting 25 female students.

Joy Baker said she often sees patients for the first time just weeks or even days before they give birth.\n \n\n   \n  “At least once a week,” a woman may start prenatal care well into their second or third trimester of pregnancy, said Baker, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in LaGrange, Georgia.\n \n\n   \n  “I accept patients up until delivery, and sometimes there are patients that we have not seen at all, and they are in their third trimester, or they’re even 39 weeks,” Baker said. “I’ve done initial prenatal visits at 39 weeks and the patient delivered a week later.”\n \n\n   \n  Starting prenatal care after the first trimester of pregnancy appears to be a growing yet dangerous trend in the United States, according to a new report.\n \n\n   \n  The  report , released Monday by the infant and maternal health nonprofit  March of Dimes , says that only about 75% of babies last year were born to mothers who started prenatal care in   the first trimester of pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve always known that getting that prenatal care started early is important,” said Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer. He added that now, in the United States, it’s moving in the “wrong direction.”\n \n\n   \n  “For a quarter of women in this country, the first visit is not happening in the first trimester,” he said, which has been part of a  four-year decline .\n \n\n   \n  Starting prenatal care early is vital because it “gives us the longest possible window to be able to understand how we can best support the health of that pregnant mom, whether it’s addressing chronic diseases that she might have and making sure those are appropriately managed or identifying risk factors,” Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  Warren identified several systemic barriers that are preventing women from starting or maintaining prenatal care. Areas where there is limited or no access to maternity care, known as maternity care deserts, are one major driving force.\n \n\n   \n  More than  a third of counties in the United States  do not have an ob/gyn, a family physician or a certified nurse-midwife. These counties also do not have birthing facilities or centers in hospitals, Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  “Those counties are home to over 2 million women of reproductive age and about 150,000 births every year in the United States,” he said. “If you live in one of those counties, you’re going to have to drive farther to get prenatal care, and when your baby is coming, you have longer to go to be able to find a place that can actually deliver.”\n \n\n   \n    A major risk to mom and baby\n \n\n   \n  The latest findings come as no surprise to Baker.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times, when I see patients who are second and third trimester, I always ask, ‘What kept you from getting in? What was your barrier?’ They often tell me, ‘I had trouble getting my Medicaid,’ or ‘I was moving around a lot,’ or ‘I had housing insecurity or food insecurity,’” Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a variety of reasons why folks may present late to care,” she said. “But when they have chronic conditions or even conditions that started in the pregnancy – like preeclampsia or gestational diabetes – the earlier that we know, the better we’re able to treat.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s why inadequate or delayed prenatal care can put women at risk of complications or even death, and it plays a big role in the current state of maternal health in the United States, Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a doctor practicing in a small town, I definitely understand that there are often barriers to care for women who have become pregnant,” she said. “There are also barriers to care for women before they become pregnant, which I think may be even more of an issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Addressing these barriers to care remain vital for improving maternal health, she said, adding that care should start well before pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the one area where we could really make a plan to prevent severe morbidity and mortality,” she said. “I think this is an area we need to divert more resources to.”\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Baker said, she treated a woman who came to her office for a first prenatal visit at 37 weeks, and the patient had high blood sugar levels.\n \n\n   \n  “We were doing just her initial lab work at 37 weeks, and she had a blood glucose of nearly 300,” Baker said, which was a serious concern for the health of both the mother and the baby. A  blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above  is typically indicative of diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  “We basically just needed to induce her labor right away because her sugars were so uncontrolled, which was an independent risk factor for stillbirth and a significant risk to her health, as well,” Baker said.\n \n\n   \n  “Had we seen her early and diagnosed her diabetes prior to pregnancy, we could have treated her, helped her control her sugars and significantly reduce the risk to mom and baby,” Baker said. “Consistent, high-quality care would have been a much better experience for her versus walking into the office one day and then being told to report to the hospital for delivery the next.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Nothing … surprised us’\n \n\n   \n  Inadequate prenatal care can often lead to pregnancy or childbirth complications for both the mother and the baby, including preterm birth.\n \n\n   \n   The new March of Dimes report gives the United States a D+ grade for having a preterm birth rate of 10.4% for the third year in a row.\n \n\n   \n  “Sadly, I actually have to say that there was nothing that surprised us” in the new report, said Divya Sooryakumar, the vice president of programs and impact of the maternal health nonprofit Every Mother Counts, who was not involved in the report.\n \n\n   \n  “One thing that I really appreciated about this year’s report was the bifurcation of the impact on preterm birth by insurance type, because that’s something that we’ve seen for a long time,” Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n  She was glad this year’s report “spelled out very clearly how pregnant people on Medicaid are disproportionately impacted by the maternal health care crisis in this country.”\n \n\n   \n  And many women may delay care because they are not sure whether the care will be fully or partially covered by their Medicaid insurance or other insurance providers.\n \n\n   \n  “Where we need to start is reimbursing prenatal care and postpartum care through Medicaid for what it actually costs to do the work. Historically, that work has been chronically under-reimbursed,” Sooryakumar said. “And it creates an incentive for systems and those delivering care to not actually take Medicaid, and then those populations continue to face the brunt of the disparities in the system.”\n \n\n   \n  This gap in adequate care can be seen in preterm birth rates, according to the new March of Dimes report, which says that between 2022 and 2024, the preterm birth rate among mothers with private insurance was 9.6%. Among mothers using Medicaid, it was 11.7%.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid covers more than 40% of births in the United States, Warren said.\n \n\n   \n    Barriers to accessing care\n \n\n   \n  For many women, especially those in maternity care deserts, even getting to a provider can be a major roadblock.\n \n\n   \n  Among its other efforts, the nonprofit organization Every Mother Counts supports a group of midwives in New Mexico who serve indigenous patients. Because of the lack of infrastructure in that area, the group’s radius for care is up to a four-hour drive. Some patients who are in labor or need prenatal care will get in their car and drive those four hours for these appointments, Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n  It also may be difficult for patients to be seen by a provider. “We know that there are all sorts of delays due to workforce shortages and shrinkage,” she said. For instance, a report published last year by the  Association of American Medical Colleges  projects that the nation will face a physician shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036.\n \n\n   \n  Sooryakumar added that the  US Supreme Court’s   Dobbs decision in 2022 , which overturned the right to an abortion, also appears to affect patients’ abilities to see a provider. For instance, some providers in states with more restrictive abortion laws   have turned away patients in the first trimester “because there is a fear that if a patient miscarries, it will be labeled as an abortion or investigated as an abortion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Another barrier to care can be how safe patients feel to seek it, especially among immigrant, mixed-status or undocumented families. “During times of immigration crackdown, that is when families will delay prenatal care,” Sooryakumar said, referring to it as a cycle.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2018, during the era of family separation and especially now, families go into hiding, and what that means is later and later access to prenatal care,” she said. “So what we’ve been seeing, especially over the last few years, is that all three of these factors – getting to a provider, being seen by a provider, and feeling safe, seeking care – are all systematically breaking down at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Incentive and reporting structures for  Federally Qualified Health Centers , which provide care to underserved communities, can also play a role in delayed care, Sooryakumar added.\n \n\n   \n  These measures are designed to encourage early prenatal care, but an unintended consequence is that some clinics may be less able or less likely to accept patients who arrive later in pregnancy. As a result, women who seek care in the third trimester can be turned away, Sooryakumar said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘That is not acceptable … in 2025’\n \n\n   \n  “Having accessible health care before pregnancy is crucial,” Warren said. “It allows people to receive routine preventive visits, screening for conditions, identification and treatment of chronic diseases.”\n \n\n   \n  Women who have chronic diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity are at “a greater risk for having a baby born preterm,” he said. And that remains a major driving force as to why the highest rates of preterm birth are concentrated in the Southeast.\n \n\n   \n  “The Southeast is one of those areas where we have higher rates of chronic disease, for example. So it’s not surprising that those preterm birth rates are the way they are,” Warren said, adding that this is compounded by a concentration of maternity care deserts in Southeast counties.\n \n\n   \n  But some states have been successful in improving preterm birth rates.\n \n\n   \n  Warren pointed to Tennessee, where there was a high percentage of women who smoked before and during pregnancy. Smoking is a risk factor for preterm birth.\n \n\n   \n  “They really have worked to make it easier for  women to quit smoking  and are doing a combination of educational programs and incentives, and work to make sure that it’s easy for them to quit smoking and that they’re supported in that journey along smoking cessation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Research has associated the state’s smoking cessation program for pregnant women with  better pregnancy outcomes , including a significantly reduced risk of having an infant with a low birth weight.\n \n\n   \n  In the Midwest, Illinois recognized that pregnant women may often face challenges such as poverty or housing and food insecurity, which can impact their access to care.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve instituted  case management programs  where they actually have folks who will work with women during pregnancy, particularly women who are at high risk of having worse pregnancy outcomes,” Warren said.\n \n\n   \n  But to address the overall maternal health crisis, Warren said, there must be a national effort to ensure that women have insurance coverage across their lives and the country must “maintain a really robust public health infrastructure.”\n \n\n   \n  He warned that should the trend of inadequate prenatal care continue, more mothers will not be there to celebrate their babies’ first birthdays.\n \n\n   \n  “Every year in this country, we lose over 20,000 babies in [the] first year of life. We lose over 600 moms, either during pregnancy or delivery, or during that first year postpartum,” Warren said. “That is not acceptable in the United States in 2025, and unless we change our course, those numbers are not going to get better.

Here’s what to know about your 2025 taxes \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed “the potential for” a mere 25% compliance rate.\n \n\n   \n  Translation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. \n \n\n   \n  But that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\n \n\n   \n  If you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS on  Form 1099-DA  (Digital Assets). You’ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you by January 30, 2026 in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\n \n\n   \n  To be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you’re shirking them.\n \n\n   \n  How? If what you report on your return doesn’t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, its  Automated Underreporter  system may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,   head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker , a provider of crypto tracking technology.\n \n\n   \n  But there is something in it for you, too.\n \n\n   \n  “The 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,” said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\n \n\n   \n    What will not be on your 1099-DA\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions that  do not  have to be   reported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\n \n\n   \n   Cost basis:  For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,  not  the cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  The cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\n \n\n   \n  Starting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time﻿, Siegal said. “No transfers can occur.”\n \n\n   \n  If you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it’s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, “check that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,” Siegal said.\n \n\n   \n   Stablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:  Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto — eg, bitcoin — on a decentralized platform that is based on another form — eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   \n  You, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\n \n\n   \n   Crypto ETFs:  Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on a  Form 1099-B  – the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\n \n\n   \n    Crypto assets on defi exchanges are not subject to third-party reporting\n \n\n   \n  If you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges – which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings – you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What’s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return. \n \n\n   \n    Mind your gains and losses\n \n\n   \n  Despite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\n \n\n   \n  Namely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  So, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00.000Z","title":"Women Face a Much Higher Risk of Homicide, Especially from Guns, During Pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the U.S. face significantly higher risks of firearm-related homicide, with a 37% increased rate compared to non-pregnant women.

Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence. Scarborough also  wrote about her own experience  in her memoir “Shattered But Not Destroyed A Mother’s Journey from Heartbreak to Hope.” She said she hopes it can help readers find strength and purpose, even when life is at its most difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life. It will never be the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-novo-nordisk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:54:00-05:00","title":"Novo Nordisk further lowers prices for weight loss, diabetes drugs for those who pay cash","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Novo Nordisk has announced price reductions for its popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, lowering the cost for self-pay patients to $199 for the first two doses and $349 per month from $499, in response to growing competition from compounding pharmacies and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound.

\nUpdated: \n        11:54 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Facing increased competition in the weight loss market and intense pressure from  President Donald Trump , Novo Nordisk announced Monday that it is lowering prices for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs for cash-paying patients.\n \n\n   \n  The move is the latest step in drugmakers’ efforts to provide discounts to Americans willing to buy medications directly from them and forgo insurance. Also, it’s another way Novo Nordisk is seeking to fend off compounding pharmacies that are cutting into the manufacturer’s sales by offering less-expensive versions of the super-popular GLP-1 drugs.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk is now offering the first two monthly doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199, with the discount expiring at the end of March. It applies to the two lowest doses of the medication.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the drugmaker is reducing the prices of Wegovy and Ozempic for other self-pay patients to $349 a month, down from $499 a month. (The 2-milligram dose of Ozempic will continue to cost $499.)\n \n\n   \n  The discounts are available for self-paying customers who use the company’s direct-to-consumer channels and through Novo Nordisk’s various partners, including Costco, GoodRx and Weight Watchers, in addition to more than 70,000 retail pharmacies.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes shortly after the drugmaker, along with rival Eli Lilly, announced a  major deal  with the Trump administration that will broaden their access to the Medicare and Medicaid markets in exchange for reducing their prices.\n \n\n   \n  Under the agreement, consumers buying injectable GLP-1 medications directly from the companies will pay an average of $350 per month to start, though the drugmakers have committed to reducing the price to about $250 over the next two years. If oral GLP-1 tablets are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the lowest dose will cost $149.\n \n\n   \n  These prices will be available when TrumpRx, the administration’s direct-to-consumer online platform, launches in early 2026.\n \n\n   \n  List prices for GLP-1 drugs range from around $1,000 to about $1,350, but consumers with insurance coverage for the medicines typically pay much less.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk is counting on its self-pay channel to help boost sales in the US, as well as abroad. The cash market accounts for about 10% of total Wegovy prescriptions in the US, said Dave Moore, executive vice president of US operations.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of interest in direct pay, self-pay,” Moore told CNN. “We know that’s an interest of people living with obesity.”\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as it faces increased pressure from Eli Lilly and compounding pharmacies, Evan Seigerman, a pharmaceutical analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The reduced self-pay price for starter doses of Ozempic and Wegovy are closer to those available from compounding pharmacies and much lower than the cash price of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, he said. (Starter doses of Zepound cost $349 a month through Eli Lilly’s direct-to-consumer channel, while higher doses are priced at $499 a month.)\n \n\n   \n  Novo’s move on pricing “likely reflects a reaction to Novo’s softening market share as the company looks to regain its footing,” Seigerman wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 1 in 8 adults say they currently use a GLP-1 drug such as Ozempic or Wegovy to lose weight or treat a chronic condition, according to a  KFF Health Tracking Poll  released Friday. About a quarter of people who have used the drugs and have health insurance said they paid the full cost themselves.\n \n\n   \n  Among those who have ever used GLP-1 drugs, cost is among the most commonly cited reasons for stopping, the poll found.\n \n\n   \n  Although insurers broadly cover Ozempic as a treatment for diabetes, coverage of Wegovy for weight loss is much spottier, in part because of the drug’s price. Wegovy’s list price is $1,349 a month, although those with insurance coverage typically pay far less.\n \n\n   \n  Novo Nordisk also launched its direct-to-consumer pharmacy this year, offering Wegovy for $499 a month. In August, it began  selling Ozempic  at half-price, $499, to patients who pay cash.\n \n\n   \n  Eli Lilly has also  slashed the price  of its GLP-1 weight loss drug, Zepbound, for self-pay patients.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/poland-train-track-ukraine-aid-sabotage-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"10:53:00-05:00","title":"Polish train track that helped transport aid to Ukraine destroyed in ‘act of sabotage,’ prime minister says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A train track connecting Warsaw and Lublin in Poland was destroyed in an 'unprecedented act of sabotage' involving an explosive device, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk declaring it a direct threat to national security and a crucial route for delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A train track between the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lublin was destroyed in an “unprecedented act of sabotage” over the weekend, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk  said Monday , noting that the railway is “crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n  An “explosive device” blew up the rail track on Sunday, Tusk said in a  post on X , adding separately that the attack “directly (targeted) the security of the Polish state and its civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  Destruction was also identified along the same route further down the railway line, he said.\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference Monday afternoon, Poland’s interior minister Marcin Kierwiński said that two separate incidents took place over the weekend – one confirmed act of sabotage, and one that was deemed “highly probable” to be sabotage. No arrests have been made so far in relation to the incidents.\n \n\n   \n  Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said that threats to Europe’s security are “real and growing.” The continent “must urgently boost capacity to protect our skies and our infrastructure,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Estonia’s Prime Minister Kristen Michal strongly condemned the damage to the train track,  writing on X  that his country stands with Poland.\n \n\n   \n  “Those behind hostile acts against (European Union) and NATO members must be exposed.

If true, they need to be strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tusk vowed that his country “will catch the perpetrators, whoever they are,” without saying who he believed was responsible for the damage.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion, which did not cause any injuries according to Tusk, is the latest in a string of incidents in Europe that have left the continent on high alert.\n \n\n   \n  Several European nations have reported incursions into their airspace in recent months, with most pointing the finger at Russia. The Kremlin has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the European Commission adopted stricter rules on issuing visas to Russian nationals, citing safety risks related to Russia’s war on Ukraine as the reason for doing this.\n \n\n   \n  “We now face unprecedented drone disruptions and sabotage on our soil. We have a duty to protect our citizens,” Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  A research paper by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggested that Russia is carrying out a “campaign of sabotage, vandalism, espionage and covert action” to destabilize European governments.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents within this alleged campaign include the deliberate damaging of undersea cables, the targeting of telecommunications towers and arson plots,  IISS said .\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the outlet Polsat News on Sunday, Poland’s Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk said that his country has been confronted with varying acts of sabotage for some time, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n \n\n   \n  Last year, an  enormous fire  destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw. Polish authorities announced in May that this was the result of arson ordered by Russian intelligence services, though Russia had previously denied allegations of orchestrating arson and sabotage operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  While “someone must have damaged” the train track, Duszczyk said, he also warned against immediately assigning the blame to Russia, PAP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia is not so powerful that every arson, every situation of this type, is provoked by Russia. However, this cannot be ruled out or underestimated in any way,” he said, according to PAP.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Internal Security Agency is working alongside police, the prosecutor’s office and railway services to investigate the matter, Polish politician Tomasz Siemoniak  said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Poland’s National Security Committee will hold a meeting on Tuesday morning, with military commanders, heads of services and the president’s representative in attendance, Tusk said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/supreme-court-trump-asylum-seekers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court to Review Rescinded Trump Policy of Turning Away Asylum Seekers at the Border","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to review the controversial 'metering' policy from the Trump administration, which involved turning back asylum seekers in Mexico before they entered U.S. soil.

But in 2018, President Donald Trump’s first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.\n \n\n   \n  An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.\n \n\n   \n  The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration  rescinded “metering”  and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.\n \n\n   \n  “In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in’ a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in’ the United States while he is still in Mexico.”\n \n\n   \n  But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”\n \n\n   \n  The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with more details on the case. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/indiana-redistricting-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-05:00","title":"Trump Ramps Up Pressure on Republicans Resisting His Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Republican lawmakers in Indiana faced intense pressure from President Donald Trump and his allies — including the Club for Growth and Fair Maps Indiana, which was staffed by former Trump aides — to redistrict congressional maps to create more Republican-friendly seats.

redistricting push \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:41 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans in Indiana have for months been hearing conflicting messages: Demands to join the nationwide redistricting arms race from President Donald Trump’s administration and his allies – and nearly unanimous opposition to the idea from their constituents, even in deep-red districts that back the president.\n \n\n   \n  Groups pushing for redistricting funded TV ads, texts, videos and robocalls demanding that state senators redraw US House maps to create one or two more Republican-friendly seats. One state senator reported “extremely negative” messages going out across her district, including to her 14-year-old grandson.\n \n\n   \n  That push hit a wall on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray  announced there weren’t enough votes  in his chamber, even with a GOP supermajority, to return in December for a special session to consider redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  What became clear in the lead-up to Bray’s announcement was that the pressure campaign launched by Trump’s allies — including the Club for Growth and Fair Maps Indiana, a newly formed group staffed by former Trump aides and led by veteran Indiana Republican operative Marty Obst — hadn’t helped and might even have backfired.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans pushing for Indiana to redistrict didn’t back down after Bray’s announcement. Trump on Sunday took to Truth Social to attack Bray and another Indiana Republican senator, Greg Goode, who had not taken a public position on redistricting, but held a town hall in Terre Haute that revealed the intense opposition of attendees and relative lack of a groundswell of support for new congressional lines.\n \n\n   \n  “Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats,” Trump said, referring to them as “Republicans in name only.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump reiterated the threat to oust Republican state senators who opposed redistricting in primaries — even though some of the eight who took public positions against drawing new lines, including Bray, aren’t on the ballot again until 2028.\n \n\n   \n  He said the GOP “must keep the Majority at all costs.”\n \n\n   \n  But Rob Kendall, an influential conservative talk radio host on WIBC in Indianapolis, said that “all these social media influencers barking” weren’t going to instill fear in lawmakers who hadn’t seen a groundswell of support for redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s the case? You’re going to knock on the door and say, ‘You should vote this senator out because he did what his constituents wanted?’” Kendall said.\n \n\n   \n  He said part of why voters in the deep-red state didn’t rally behind redistricting is that they’d watched Indiana lawmakers fail to sufficiently address rising property taxes earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “But they’ll move heaven and earth to help Republicans pick up two seats in Congress,” Kendall said. “And people are saying, wait a second — you won’t do anything to help me, but you’ll do all this to help your party. I think that rubbed people the wrong way.”\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Goode’s home was swatted, Goode and Vigo County Sheriff Derek Fell both said. Swatting is a  false report made to authorities  with the express purpose of luring them to a location — usually a home — where they are led to believe a horrific crime has been committed or is in progress.\n \n\n   \n  Fell said in a statement posted on Facebook that sheriff’s deputies responded Sunday evening to an email sent to the Terre Haute Police Department “advising harm had been done to persons inside a home, located in southeastern Vigo County.” He added: “Investigation showed that this was a prank or false email (also known as ‘swatting’).”\n \n\n   \n  “Our office along with federal authorities will investigate this incident with every intention of discovering who is responsible,” Fell said.\n \n\n   \n    Redistricting supporters aren’t backing down\n \n\n   \n  The drama over whether Indiana would join the growing list of states to redraw their congressional maps offered a window into the pressure Republicans face to follow Trump’s wishes.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice to make the case to Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders and met with lawmakers who had been invited to the White House. National Republicans took to social media to threaten primary challenges to Republicans who failed to support redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself, should be PRIMARIED,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He suggested Braun “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes.”\n \n\n   \n  Braun, who had called the special session, said in a statement that he wasn’t backing down.\n \n\n   \n  “I called for our legislators to convene to ensure Hoosiers’ voices in Washington, DC, are not diluted by the democrats’ gerrymandering,” Braun said in a statement. “Our state senators need to do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps. Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Supporters and opponents of redistricting agreed before Bray’s announcement on where things stood. The House would vote to approve new maps intended to turn the state’s 7-to-2, Republican-to-Democrat congressional delegation into one that is 8-to-1 or 9-to-0. But the fate of a new congressional map was much less clear in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Braun, the Indiana Republican Party and the state’s entire GOP congressional delegation have endorsed redistricting. But they’ve also made clear it wasn’t their idea and haven’t sought to force individual legislators’ hands. It’s a stark contrast with Kansas, another state Trump-world is eyeing for redistricting, where the Republican House speaker has stripped three Republicans of their committee chairmanships for refusing to back new congressional lines there.\n \n\n   \n  Longtime Republican Sen. Jean Leising, who represents a deep-red, rural swath of southeastern Indiana, said in an earlier statement she was opposed to redistricting because her constituents were “overwhelmingly opposed” to redistricting. But Leising was also incensed by the campaign to pressure her.\n \n\n   \n  “Some have even been sent via cell phone to students in my district, including my 14-year-old grandson,” she said. “These groups do not have the best interest of my rural area or the state of Indiana at heart, and their methods are completely unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Leising said only 6% of her constituents supported redistricting. Other senators shared similar numbers, based on the contacts their offices had received. Republican Sen. Kyle Walker — who is also the executive vice president of Obst’s political consulting firm and a member of the Indiana Republican Party State Committee — said in a statement Thursday he would vote against redistricting because 93% of his constituents opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  In a town hall earlier this month, Goode heard from 71 attendees who opposed redistricting and none who supported it, The Indianapolis Star  reported .\n \n\n   \n    A debate with huge midterm consequences\n \n\n   \n  Democrats need to gain just three seats in the US House after next year’s midterms to take control of the chamber and potentially block parts of Trump’s agenda during the final two years of his White House term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the mid-decade redistricting arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to create five additional GOP-friendly seats. So far, GOP-led mapmaking efforts have redrawn seats in four states – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio – to add a total of nine potential seats to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Californians voted by a large margin to approve five additional Democratic-friendly districts, which represents the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state. The Justice Department has since gone to court to try to invalidate the California referendum.\n \n\n   \n  With Virginia Democrats also moving to consider redistricting and produce two or three Democratic-leaning seats, Republicans could end up with a wash nationally unless other GOP-led states act to create more friendly seats.\n \n\n   \n  Hours before Bray issued his statement, Club for Growth President David McIntosh told CNN that his group was “working with the leadership in the Senate” to try to persuade undecided senators to back redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  McIntosh said Bray and Senate leaders are “being careful and cautious, as they should be,” as they try to get the votes necessary to pass new maps.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what they’ll do is bring it up, have more discussion among the Republican senators, and I’m confident in the end they’ll convince people of the view that I have: that really, Republicans need to step up and do this,” he said. “They shouldn’t be afraid of the bad press they might get or their Democratic colleagues getting mad at them.”\n \n\n   \n  Obst, who launched Fair Maps Indiana, said the group he is leading also includes Trump 2024 senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as well as political consultant Chip Englander and Trump ad man John Brabender.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a shame Sen. Bray blocked the special session,” Obst said Friday. “It’s clear he does not support President Trump’s agenda. Senators should show up and do their jobs and vote on redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Like elections, decisions have consequences. I anticipate those consequences to be severe.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/food/target-starbucks-exclusive-drink-launch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:39:00-05:00","title":"Target and Starbucks Team Up on Exclusive Holiday Drink to Boost Sales","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Target and Starbucks are collaborating on an exclusive Frozen Peppermint Hot Chocolate drink, available in Target stores with Starbucks locations starting November 17, 2025.

They’re teaming up on an exclusive new drink \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:39 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two of America’s most embattled retail chains are working together to drum up some excitement from customers this holiday season. They sure could use it.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning Monday, a Frozen Peppermint Hot Chocolate drink will be available exclusively at Starbucks cafés inside Target stores. The vast majority of Target’s 2,000 locations include a Starbucks, but this marks the first-ever holiday drink collaboration between the two companies.\n \n\n   \n  Retailers have been under immense pressure this year as inflation and tariffs drive  consumer sentiment near record lows . A number of consumer brands said on their quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street analysts that low-income consumers in particular are growing increasingly cost-sensitive, and they’re cutting back on non-essentials.\n \n\n   \n  That trend has hit Target and  Starbucks  particularly hard: Target, because it specializes in discretionary items, including impulse buys and home decor; and Starbucks, because it sells expensive drinks that consumers has perceived to be lower value than a wide array of hipper coffee chains and cheaper alternatives.\n \n\n   \n  Target is also contending with two consecutive quarters of slumping foot traffic, partly because of backlash over its  reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion programs . Plus, Starbucks’ new CEO is one year into his turnaround plan but is closing stores, laying off employees and facing ongoing strikes from disgruntled workers.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, the two brands hope the fandom around Starbucks’ specialty drinks is strong enough to lure customers into Target stores during the all-important holiday shopping season.\n \n\n   \n  The Frappuccino-based drink is positioned to be the “perfect companion for holiday shopping runs,” Target said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The exclusive drink is “part of a strategy to inject a bit more novelty back into the store experience,” Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CNN. “We also know that consumers love exclusive menu items, particularly in beverages, so this could nudge people into visiting Target just to try the drink.”\n \n\n   \n  Prices for the drink start at $5.95 for a grande size. Members of Target’s paid  loyalty program  can buy it Monday before it’s available to the public on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The beverage is just one of the ways Target is trying to attract customers to stores in November and December: It’s also hosting in-store toy, makeup and tech demonstrations  scattered  throughout the two months. Employees are also  reportedly  being told to smile more at shoppers in an attempt to make the stores   feel more welcoming.\n \n\n   \n  Target ( TGT ) reports earnings Wednesday. The company announced last month that it laid off around  1,000 corporate employees . Sales have fallen for three consecutive quarters, and the stock has lost more than a third of its value this year.\n \n\n   \n  Saunders doesn’t think an exclusive drink alone will “move the foot-traffic dial in a major way,” he said. But, he added, “every little bit helps,” – especially since Target needs it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/media/sky-sports-womens-tiktok-account-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"09:32:00-05:00","title":"Sky Sports ditches new women’s TikTok account after viewers brand it ‘sexist’ and ‘patronizing’","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sky Sports launched a new TikTok account called 'Halo' targeting young female sports fans, designed to offer sports content through a female lens.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:49 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump suggested he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple  high-level briefings  last week and a mounting US  show of force  in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Officials briefed Trump last week on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially  oust President Nicolás Maduro . The US military, meanwhile, has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded “Operation Southern Spear.”\n \n\n   \n  In another sign of increasing tensions, the US announced Sunday that it will designate a Venezuelan cartel as a  foreign terrorist organization , which Trump suggested would allow the US military to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change.\n \n\n   \n  “I sort of have made up my mind — yeah. I mean, I can’t tell you what it would be, but I sort of have,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked directly about those meetings and whether he had made a decision.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told reporters Sunday, however, that the US may have discussions with Maduro, adding Venezuela “would like to talk.”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump been briefed on?\n \n\n   \n  A small group, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, briefed the president on Wednesday. A larger national security team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials, met with Trump in the Situation Room on Thursday, according to a US official.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team reviewed target options during both meetings.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been presented a wide range of options for Venezuela, including air strikes on military or government facilities and drug-trafficking routes, or a more direct attempt to take out Maduro. CNN  previously reported  that the president was considering plans to target cocaine production facilities and drug-trafficking routes inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also possible he decides to forgo any action. Trump said last month he had  authorized the CIA  to operate in the country, but administration officials  told lawmakers this month  that the US didn’t have a legal justification that would support attacks against any land targets — though it is possible they could generate one. Trump recently told CBS’ “60 Minutes” he was not considering strikes inside Venezuela, despite earlier sounding open to the idea.\n \n\n   \n  The president has, in meetings, seemed wary of ordering actions that could end in failure or put US troops at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n    What assets are in the region?\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks,   the US has amassed its naval forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has launched  at least 20 strikes  on alleged drug-trafficking boats, an effort officials say is meant to disrupt the flow of drugs into the US.\n \n\n   \n  The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the region last week and entered the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, the Navy announced.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the aircraft carrier itself — described as the US Navy’s “most lethal combat platform” — the US has amassed roughly 15,000 military personnel in the region, alongside more than a dozen warships, including a cruiser, destroyers, an air and missile defense command ship, amphibious assault vessels, and an attack submarine. It has also deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that the US military “would be ready, if asked” to take action in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “The president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people. And I can speak from the Army’s perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world,” Driscoll said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts describe the level of military buildup as significant.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by both the scale and the speed, and it is unprecedented,” Eric Farnsworth, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. “It’s the most significant build up this century. In fact, you have to go back to 1989, the US invasion of Panama, for anything remotely similar.”\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela, in turn, has said  it is launching  a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment.\n \n\n   \n    Potential risks and rewards\n \n\n   \n  Regime change in Venezuela would require serious commitment by the US and carries high risk, but ousting Maduro could give Trump and his team credit for something that has proved elusive to multiple US administrations, including his own.\n \n\n   \n  During  his first term in office , Trump officially recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader, but a failed coup attempt in 2019 meant Guaidó never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump ousted Maduro, the US president could claim major wins: getting a strongman out and an elected leader in, the possibility of enhanced collaboration on flows of drugs and migration, and potential deals on oil.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have also warned that if Trump ordered strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, the US president could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency.\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Caracas on Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.”\n \n\n   \n  Offering a direct message to the US, he said, “Stop the insane hand of those who order bombing, killing and bringing war to South America, to the Caribbean. Stop the war. No to war.”\n \n\n   \n  Extended US military involvement also runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars. Both Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth served in the military during the Iraq War and have since expressed skepticism about entangling the US in foreign conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/germany-holocaust-auction-scli-intl-grm","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:56:00-05:00","title":"Germany cancels auction of Holocaust artifacts after backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany has canceled an auction of Holocaust artifacts organized by the auction house Auktionhaus Felzmann after strong backlash from Holocaust survivors and diplomatic intervention.

French fighter jets, Elysee Palace announces \n       \n  By Joseph Ataman and Kosta Gak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:45 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukraine will purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France, the Elysee Palace confirmed, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Paris on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We will have the greatest air defense system, one of the greatest in the world,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after signing the letter of intent with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Villacoublay Air Force Base southwest of Paris on Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  At a news conference, Zelensky told reporters that the deal would include eight air defense systems and six launchers in what he described as an “historic agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  Macron said that some of the deliveries of drones, interceptor drones and guided bombs, would come in the “very short term” with manufacturing commitments made for the coming three years. The Elysee Palace said that the purchases covered by the letter of intent would span the next 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Macron said that Ukraine will receive a “new generation” of the SAMP/T missile interceptor – largely comparable to the US-made Patriot system – which will be available in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Questioned over the financing of the deal, Zelensky said Ukraine was examining the possible co-production of the French-made jets.\n \n\n   \n    Good friends\n \n\n   \n  This was Zelensky’s ninth visit to Paris since the 2022 Russian invasion, as France has become a central pillar of Western support for Ukraine, particularly given the unpredictability of US weapons supplies.\n \n\n   \n  In a powerful show of Franco-Ukrainian military cooperation, the leaders inked the agreement in front of a Rafale jet loaded up with guided AASM bombs and beside a SCALP cruise missile that Paris has already supplied to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders were flanked by a SAMP/T missile interceptor system and a GF300 radar system that France has also sent to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafale is a multi-role fourth generation fighter jet, similar in role to the American F-16, capable of carrying out long-range bombing and dogfighting tasks in the same mission, according to the French military.\n \n\n   \n  France has previously provided Kyiv with Mirage jets, which form the backbone of France’s aerial bomber force.\n \n\n   \n  France has seen broad success exporting the Rafale, including to India.\n \n\n   \n  In what has been described as the largest aerial battle of the modern era, India lost one of its Rafale jets in combat with Pakistani forces in May, according to a  French intelligence source . However, the French jets’ performance in the India Air Force has been widely praised by  expert reviews  in the Indian press.\n \n\n   \n  The French aviation firm behind the Rafale, Dassault, is looking to boost its production output to four fighter jets per month and the company said it has 233 jets still on order, as of October 7.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement signed Monday is merely a letter of intent, still a way off a concrete purchase, spurring questions as to how Ukraine will pay for the French jets when Ukraine signed a letter of understanding  for 100-150 Swedish-made Grippen jets in October.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to European Union members on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested that Ukraine had three options – independently or in combination – to meet its financing needs. She said these were grants from EU allies, a loan funded by EU borrowing or loan linked to the cash balance of frozen Russian assets, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The Elysee Palace also said that European financing could be used for the purchases as well as financing from frozen Russian assets.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/sport/tennis-atp-finals-jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"08:07:00-05:00","title":"Jannik Sinner overcomes Carlos Alcaraz in two tight sets to retain his ATP Finals crown","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jannik Sinner defeats Carlos Alcaraz in a tightly contested ATP Finals final in Turin, Italy, retaining his year-end title with a 7-6(4), 7-5 victory.

However, Sinner had to step up and save set point at 5-6 with a booming 117 miles-per-hour second serve, going on to force the tiebreak.\n \n\n   \n  From there, the Italian took firm control after several backhand errors from Alcaraz – who had to receive treatment on his right thigh during the match – opened the door for Sinner to take the first set.\n \n\n   \n  The start of the second set went awry for the defending champion as he served two double faults to give the Spaniard an early break, but Sinner got his own break in the sixth game to bring it back to serve.\n \n\n   \n  With the loud Italian crowd behind him, Sinner proceeded to save another break point in the seventh game before going on to break Alcaraz in the decider, dropping to the court in celebration after confirming the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the win, Sinner has now lifted the trophy at the last two ATP Finals without dropping a set all tournament and became just the fourth man to defend the year-end title since 2001, joining Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Lleyton Hewitt.\n \n\n   \n  After the final, Sinner gave credit to his team and to his partner in the “Sincaraz” rivalry: “We are individual athletes, but without my team, this is not possible. Celebrating this trophy at the end of the year after such an intense last couple of months, there is no better ending.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a very, very close match. I saved a set point in the first set and I am extremely happy with how I handled the situation and it means the world to me.\n \n\n   \n  “It was tough today. Playing against Carlos, you have to play at your best. I was serving very well at times, but he is one of the best returners in the game. … I am very happy. It was a tough match, but it means a lot to me ending the season like this. It is amazing.”\n \n\n   \n  Alcaraz, who will remain the year-end world No. 1 despite the loss, praised Sinner after the match but also lobbed a friendly warning ahead of the 2026 season: “It is a great year for Jannik and now time to rest.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope you are going to be ready for next year because I will be ready. Hopefully, I will play more finals against you.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"11:11:00.000Z","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 83","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted 21 strikes between September 2 and November 15, 2025, killing 83 people and destroying 22 boats, as part of a campaign labeled by the Trump administration as an 'armed conflict' against drug cartels.

\n       \n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:11 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 83 people in 21 strikes that have destroyed 22 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor.

Thanksgiving flights \n       \n  By Marnie Hunter, Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Air travelers have been on a wild ride this fall with flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about air travel over the busy holiday period when 6 million Americans are expected to head to airports across the country, according to AAA figures.\n \n\n   \n    Will airline flight schedules be restored to normal by then?\n \n\n   \n  The longest shutdown in US history came to an end Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Mandatory cuts to flights at 40 major airports ended on Monday morning, when a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order was lifted.\n \n\n   \n  “The flight reduction emergency order will be terminated on Monday, November 17 at 6 a.m. This means normal operations can resume across the National Airspace System,” said a Sunday joint statement from US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.\n \n\n   \n  During the shutdown, some air traffic controllers who were not getting paid did not show up for work. The staffing shortages triggered the FAA order to reduce flights incrementally. The flight cuts began on November 7 and were set to increase gradually up to 10%, but they stopped at 6% with the end of the shutdown. The cuts were reduced to 3% of flights over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Travel insiders and analysts have said that it could  take a week or more  for airlines to recover from the recent disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy said last week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines for America, a trade group representing major US airlines, said in a statement late Wednesday that the government reopening would “allow U.S. airlines to restore their operations ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday.”\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian feels optimistic about a swift recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Thanksgiving is going to be a great holiday period of travel,” Bastian told  “CBS Mornings” on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Katy Nastro, a travel expert with Going.com, said the recent high level of disruptions is unlikely to carry into the holiday week. That said, the air traffic controller staffing shortages that prompted the FAA to order flight cuts are likely to be a factor even after schedules are restored.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are still down a certain number of controllers … we may see disruptions into Thanksgiving, yet likely not to this extent,” Nastro said.\n \n\n   \n    What are the staffing challenges?\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding air traffic controller shortage has worsened with the shutdown. DOT Secretary Duffy said that before the shutdown an average of four controllers retired each day. That’s recently jumped to 15 to 20 per day, meaning that “this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up,” Duffy told CNN on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Passengers arriving at TSA lines at select airports, in Houston and Atlanta, for example, have intermittently experienced long security wait times because of staffing challenges.\n \n\n   \n    What strategies do travelers need to mitigate disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  No matter what happens in the days to come, travelers should head to the airport for Thanksgiving trips prepared with as many resources as possible for a quick pivot.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of your travel day, download your airline’s app and enable push notifications about flight changes. Third-party apps such as FlightAware, Flighty and TripIt can also be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  And research flight alternatives, in case your original trip gets disrupted. Travel site Hopper suggests booking with its Disruption Assistance service, which offers rebooking on any airline. Several other booking platforms and airlines offer similar services.\n \n\n   \n  Get to the airport early – at least two hours before domestic flights, but possibly even earlier during the hectic holiday period.\n \n\n   \n  The first flight of the day is a great option, according to Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. “In general, flights departing after 9 a.m. are 2X more likely to be delayed than departures scheduled between 5-8 a.m.,” Berg said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    Hustling for alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Right now, flights aren’t usually going out full, so getting on another flight shouldn’t be a problem, said John DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com.\n \n\n   \n  “However, if it’s over the holidays, the flights are going out full and you will not be able to get on [another] flight that easy. So you could be stuck. Time is of the essence — you’ve got to hustle.”\n \n\n   \n  Stay on top of your flight status, immediately contact the airline – through the airline app’s chat function, while simultaneously calling the airline, and getting in line for customer service if you’re at the airport. Give yourself as many options as possible to get your situation resolved quickly. “And always be nice,” DiScala added.\n \n\n   \n  See more tips on what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled  here .\n \n\n   \n    Changing plans\n \n\n   \n  For travel this week, most US air travelers have been able to change their tickets — even in basic economy class — free of charge, thanks airline waivers for near-term flights affected by the shutdown. Bad weather or staffing issues could trigger waivers during the holiday period, DiScala says. Keep an eye on the weather, which is always a wild card during the holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  DiScala urges travelers making new ticket purchases to avoid basic economy fares in case any future waivers exclude the cheapest tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Use waivers to your advantage, DiScala advises. It’s a free opportunity to tinker with your plans — whether you skip your trip, extend your stay or look for a better itinerary.\n \n\n   \n    Making contingency plans\n \n\n   \n  Making a solid Plan B is worthwhile if it’s critical that you get to your destination quickly.\n \n\n   \n  That could mean purchasing a back-up ticket for at least a few hours later than your original flight on a different airline, DiScala said, “but that’s only if you absolutely need to be somewhere or you’re really worried about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The easiest way to do that is with loyalty points or miles because you can easily redeposit those if you cancel the back-up flight. If you need to purchase a second ticket, be sure to avoid basic economy so that you can cancel for a travel credit that’s typically good for a year.\n \n\n   \n  Making a car rental reservation can be a smart idea in cases of disruption. Major rental car players Hertz and Avis reported a spike in one-way rental bookings amid the first waves of the recent flight cuts, so jump on that option quickly. Hertz reported a 20% year-over-year increase in one-way bookings over the weekend, noting that many flight cancellations were on shorter, regional routes.\n \n\n   \n  If you’re flying on a regional route, under 500 miles or so, during a period plagued by disruptions “you might want to consider driving because the regional jets are the first to get canceled,” DiScala said.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s no comfort to passengers on canceled flights, those regional cancellations typically affect fewer passengers, aviation consultant Mike Boyd pointed out. His advice last week as flight cuts were being instituted was to “take a breather” and “relax.”\n \n\n   \n  Boyd underlined that the FAA-ordered cuts applied to “flights, not seats, not passengers. Flights,” and noted that reductions in American Airlines flights to Texas destinations such as Waco and Killeen likely affected a total of about 50 people per flight.\n \n\n   \n    Insurance options\n \n\n   \n  Many travel insurance policies apply to “unforeseen events,” according to Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth. But once an event like the shutdown is known, it’s often not covered. Check with your insurer on your policy’s fine print.\n \n\n   \n  Cancel For Any Reason and Interruption For Any Reason coverage offer the highest level of protection for travelers shopping for insurance, she said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Chris Boyette, Andy Rose, Amanda Musa, Alaa Elassar and Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/business/trump-prices-affordability","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-05:30","title":"Trump is right: He lowered some of your costs.

But he also made many prices higher \n       \n  By David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump keeps  downplaying America’s affordability crisis , and he continues to falsely claim that inflation and overall prices have fallen during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  “Our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things,” Trump told reporters in Florida Sunday evening. “They’re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is annual  inflation stood at 3%  in September. Grocery prices have  gained 1.4%  between January and September, and US consumer prices have  risen 1.7%  on average during Trump’s second term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s just an average. Look a little more closely, and Trump really can claim credit for  some  falling prices. But he is also to blame for some  rising  prices.\n \n\n   \n  A complex mix of factors determines the price of any particular item.   As anyone who took Econ 101 remembers, supply and demand remain the primary influences over consumer prices. But commodity costs, wholesale prices, transportation and fuel concerns, regulations, labor and a whole host of other considerations can weigh on what people ultimately pay at the store.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s policies, perhaps more than any president’s in recent memory, have directly influenced the prices on thousands of consumer goods – both lower and higher.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump has done to lower prices\n \n\n   \n   Drugs:  Pharmaceuticals remain the the most prominent example of Trump directly influencing prices lower. Trump has put significant pressure on drugmakers to lower prices, and many have followed suit.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, Trump and his administration announced that certain  blockbuster obesity drugs  will be available for as little as $149 per month, significantly lower than the list prices, which can top $1,000. Trump has also announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and others to set prices of new medications at  “Most Favored Nation”  levels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.\n \n\n   \n   Eggs:  When Trump took office, egg prices had been surging because a deadly avian flu epidemic devastated the egg-laying hen population. Egg prices peaked above  $8 a dozen in late February  after rising steadily over the previous year.\n \n\n   \n  A couple weeks into Trump’s term, his  USDA announced an initiative  to lower prices by increasing biosecurity on egg-laying farms, providing aid to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily lifting restrictions on egg imports. The plan worked: Egg prices have since fallen to just over $2 a dozen.\n \n\n   \n   Oil:  Trump dismantled many oil drilling regulations that he claimed would expand US oil production – but, so far at least, that hasn’t made any meaningful difference. Trump, however, publicly pressured OPEC+ on prices, and though the group of oil-producing nations denied Trump had anything to do with its decision, OPEC+ boosted production several times this year, and US oil fell below $60 a barrel – down from $75 when Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  Industry experts have  partially attributed  OPEC’s decision to Trump’s influence, although they also say OPEC’s hand may have been forced by nations that acted independently of the group. And oil prices have ebbed and flowed with sinking demand and on-and-off Middle East conflicts throughout the year, as well.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also announced some policies that could have long-term benefits for consumers but whose effects remain to be seen.\n \n\n   \n   Beef and fruit:  Last week, Trump signed executive orders that  lowered tariffs  on imported beef and other produce that mostly grows overseas. That could lower some of those prices, but the tariff cuts largely just  restore import prices to where they were  before Trump launched his sweeping trade war.\n \n\n   \n   Cars:  Trump’s domestic policy and tax bill  did away with a number of financial penalties  on automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency rules. That is saving some US automakers billions of dollars a year and could cut the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. But that may not translate to lower consumer prices because Trump also raised tariff costs on automakers.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump has done to raise prices\n \n\n   \n   Tariffs:  By far the largest price increase on consumers that Trump has imposed came in the form of his sweeping tariffs on virtually every foreign country’s goods. That has raised the effective US tariff rate to 13.6%, up from 1.2% in 2024 – a gigantic tax increase that has raised the average American household’s costs this year by $1,200, according to the conservative-leaning  Tax Foundation .\n \n\n   \n  The calculation is tricky, because tariffs are paid by US importers who typically pass those costs onto wholesalers, retailers and eventually consumers. JPMorgan this month estimated that consumers are currently paying about 20% of tariffs’ costs, but many businesses have announced they can no longer afford to eat those expenses and will soon be forced to raise consumer prices. That’s why the Tax Foundation estimates the average household’s annual costs will rise by $1,600 because of Trump’s tariffs next year.\n \n\n   \n   Benefits cuts:  Historic  cuts to America’s safety net programs , including Medicaid and food stamps, will raise out-of-pocket expenses for the country’s neediest: Those earning less than $18,000 a year will have to spend more than 1% more going forward because of Trump’s tax and spending policy bill, according to  Penn Wharton \n \n\n   \n  The bill also cut some popular tax credits, including the  $7,500  that the government chipped in when customers bought electric vehicles.\n \n\n   \n   America’s debt:  Trump’s massive tax cut and spending bill will add nearly $4 trillion to America’s $36 trillion in debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. That briefly sent the bond market into a tizzy in May, leading US Treasury yields ﻿ , which trade in opposite direction to prices, significantly higher. Investors had effectively sent a warning that they may be unwilling to keep funding the government’s coffers unless they get paid more for it.\n \n\n   \n  Yields have since come down – but not by a ton. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage, credit card and auto loan rates, remains above 4.1%.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s spending and economic policies have also hurt the dollar, which has fallen more than 8% this year. That can boost the appeal of US-made goods abroad, but it also makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump has effectively tried to will lower prices into existence,  recently calling  America’s affordability crisis a “lie” and a “complete con job.” The White House, while casting blame elsewhere, acknowledged it has some work to do.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in,” the White House said in a statement Friday. “We’re making progress — and the best is yet to come.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/economy/powell-fed-consensus","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Jerome Powell’s era of consensus at the Fed is over","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve is experiencing a significant shift in policy dynamics, ending Jerome Powell’s era of consensus with growing internal disagreement over interest rate policy.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal Reserve policymakers are split over whether they should continue cutting interest rates, ending a period of consensus that has defined Chair Jerome Powell’s leadership of the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s  latest decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point in late October was opposed by two policymakers: one official who preferred to hold rates steady, and another who wanted a larger rate cut instead. A pair of opposing dissents had not been seen since 2019. Earlier this year, more than one Fed governor cast a dissenting vote for the first time in more than three decades.\n \n\n   \n  The growing  divide among Fed officials   has spilled out into public speeches in recent days, presenting a challenge for Powell as he works to retain consensus among colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  That division is a direct result of the uncertainty in the US economy and questions around the impacts of President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy. The murky economic outlook has divided the rate-setting committee, which is tasked by Congress to keep the labor market intact and to tame inflation. Some Fed officials want to continue to focus on reining in higher prices, believing that tariffs could jack up inflation. Other policymakers say it’s time to prioritize a weakening labor market.\n \n\n   \n  Economists say the potential implications of a divided Fed are a mixed bag, but nonetheless represent an extraordinary shift in the politics of the world’s most powerful central bank.\n \n\n   \n  “If these intellectual disagreements aren’t able to be reconciled, then that could affect the Fed’s effectiveness and credibility,” said Derek Tang, an economist at LHMeyer, a monetary policy analytics firm.\n \n\n   \n  “In the next decade or so, the Fed could become like the Supreme Court, with people voting along party lines,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed chair’s tough job\n \n\n   \n  As leader of America’s central bank — and chair of its influential rate-setting committee — Powell now has his work cut out for him, but the outcome may be beyond his control.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past few decades, the Fed chair has increasingly played a key part in shepherding the central bank’s policy decisions through careful consensus-building efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed chair’s role of seeking unanimous agreement notably began under former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, according to Jon Hilsenrath, a long-time Fed watcher and senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX Group. It involves regular meetings with members of the Fed’s seven-person Board of Governors and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents.\n \n\n   \n  “Powell built on what Bernanke and (former Fed Chair Janet) Yellen did,” Hilsenrath said. “But this kind of breakdown in consensus is beyond Jay Powell or his leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  In a post-meeting news conference after the Fed announced its October decision, Powell said there were  “strongly differing views”  among officials on how to move forward. He had previously characterized the division as merely a “healthy debate.”\n \n\n   \n  Dissents from Fed officials are expected to persist through the final meetings of Powell’s term as chair, which ends in May. That could make it difficult for Wall Street to know what to expect from the Fed: The chances of a December rate cut are currently a coin toss, according to futures.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s policymaking these days has indeed gotten much more complex: During the pandemic-fueled recession in 2020, it was clear the Fed needed to lower borrowing costs aggressively — and keep rates at ultra-low levels — to shore up a battered economy. Similarly in 2022, it was obvious the Fed needed to hike rates aggressively to tamp down the fastest inflation in four decades.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, a more divided Fed could bode well for its credibility.\n \n\n   \n  “The market might also come to a conclusion that they’re not going to make extreme choices or lock themselves in to decisions that could lead the economy and the financial system in the wrong direction,” Hilsenrath said. “If there’s more disagreement, then that kind of moderates the Fed’s behavior.”\n \n\n   \n    To cut or not to cut\n \n\n   \n  Assessing the economy became even harder during the government shutdown, which was the longest in American history and suspended the release of weeks of economic data. At their October meeting, Fed officials were left without key readings on inflation and employment, metrics that are vital for policymakers when considering how to address their dual mandate.\n \n\n   \n  With the government now reopened,  an upcoming deluge of data  could easily tilt the scales in either direction.\n \n\n   \n  On the side of holding rates steady to tame inflation are three of the four regional presidents who vote on policy this year. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who dissented in October and preferred no rate cut, explained in a statement that his decision came about partly because people in his district have voiced “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  His colleague Alberto Musalem, president of the St. Louis Fed and also a voter this year, said this week: “We need to proceed and tread with caution, because I think there’s limited room for further easing without monetary policy becoming overly accommodative,” at a Thursday event in Evansville, Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she would be “hesitant to ease policy further,” and that it would “likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the opposing camp includes officials who believe the Fed should continue to lower rates, primarily because they don’t see tariffs as likely having a persistent impact on inflation. They also believe the labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff if rates aren’t lowered quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who has taken leave from his role as head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers in order to fill a temporarily vacant seat on the central bank’s Board of Governors, dissented on the Fed’s decision last month to lower rates by a quarter point, instead backing a larger, half-point cut. In his latest remarks, he argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that inflation is bound to slow “substantially” regardless.\n \n\n   \n  Miran is joined by Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, also Trump appointees, who have called for rate cuts starting in July. They believe that with inflation close enough to the Fed’s target rate of 2%, the primary concern should be the softening labor market.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” Miran told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/venezuela-cartel-state-department","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"05:51:00-04:00","title":"US ramps up pressure campaign on Venezuela, set to designate cartel as a foreign terrorist organization","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is set to designate Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), effective November 24, 2025, citing links to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and high-ranking officials.

\nUpdated: \n        5:51 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The United States increased pressure on Venezuela over the weekend, saying it will designate Cartel de los Soles as  a foreign terrorist organization  — a move President Donald Trump suggested could allow the US to target certain assets and infrastructure in the country.\n \n\n   \n  The US alleges the cartel is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking officials, and the announcement was yet another sign of tensions between the countries as Trump weighs  potential military options .\n \n\n   \n  “Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela’s legitimate government,” the  State Department  said in a press release. “Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  The designation, which will be effective November 24, comes as the United States has  ramped up its military presence  in the Caribbean, including with the arrival of the world’s largest aircraft carrier on Sunday. Tensions have risen between President Donald Trump and Maduro as US forces target alleged drug-trafficking operations, with the US conducting its  21st known strike  against an alleged drug boat over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested Sunday that designating Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization allows the US military the ability to target Maduro’s assets and infrastructure inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “It allows us to do that, but we haven’t said we’re going to do that,” Trump told reporters. “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out.”\n \n\n   \n  “They would like to talk,” he said, without elaborating further.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump signaled on Friday that he had made a decision on military actions regarding Venezuela, he was noncommittal on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said Sunday he doesn’t believe the administration needs congressional authorization for potential military actions inside Venezuela. Rather, the president said he would like to keep lawmakers informed without a say.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to keep Congress involved. I mean, we’re stopping drug dealers and drugs from coming into our country. … We don’t have to get their approval. But I think letting them know is good,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported  skepticism from some experts  on the legality of the boat strikes, as the United States has not declared war against Venezuela. The terrorist organization designation authorizes a US president to impose sanctions but doesn’t explicitly authorize the use of lethal force.\n \n\n   \n  However, the foreign terrorist organization designation is one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism designations. It is illegal for US persons to knowingly provide “material support or resources” to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and representatives and members of one are blocked from entering the US.\n \n\n   \n  Congress has  seven days  to review the foreign terrorist organization designation after being notified, and “in the absence of Congressional action to block the designation,” it then takes effect, according to the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Rubio  said  the foreign terrorist organization designation gave the United States the right to “target these groups.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug-dealing organizations. Drug dealing is the kind of terrorism they’re doing, and it’s not the only,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department’s announcement comes after the US Treasury Department sanctioned Cartel de los Soles in July, deeming it a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” organization and alleging it “provided material support to Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Treasury, “The cartel’s name is derived from the sun insignias often portrayed on the uniforms of Venezuelan military officials.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi put out a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro  to face US drug charges . She has  not presented conclusive evidence  of the Venezuelan leader’s alleged role in international drug trafficking. Caracas has flatly rejected the claims.\n \n\n   \n  “Cartel de los Soles, per se, doesn’t exist. It’s a journalistic expression created to refer to the involvement of Venezuelan authorities in drug trafficking,” Phil Gunson, a researcher with the International Crisis Group based in Caracas, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But this doesn’t mean there aren’t military personnel or government officials involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  “The cartels are here, the Colombians and the Mexicans, too. There are drug shipments via the Orinoco River and by air through clandestine airstrips, flights from Apure to Central America, and so on. All of this wouldn’t be possible without direct involvement from above,” Gunson said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon, Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood, Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/saudi-execution-rate-human-rights-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"08:26:00-11:17","title":"Saudi Arabia Executes Egyptian Fisherman on Drug Charges, Amid Rising Human Rights Concerns","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohamed Saad, a 28-year-old Egyptian fisherman, was detained in Saudi Arabia on drug-smuggling charges and executed on October 21, 2025, after eight years in prison.

The Saudis say he smuggled drugs. He was one of hundreds executed this year \n       \n  By Muhammad Darwish, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:26 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For a year, Mohamed Saad’s family had no idea whether he was alive or dead. The 28-year-old Egyptian fisherman had gone out on a routine trip off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and never returned. Relatives searched for months with no word from authorities. When they finally heard his voice, it was from a prison in Tabuk, northern  Saudi Arabia,  where Saad said he was being held on drug-smuggling charges.\n \n\n   \n  On October 21 the  Saudi state killed him,  eight years after being detained. The family learned of his death through a cellmate. The official Saudi news agency said a court had judged him guilty of  smuggling amphetamine pills . As of now, Saudi officials still have not notified Saad’s family of his killing, nor told them where he is buried, a person close to the family told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Saad was one of hundreds of people executed this year in  Saudi Arabia,  most accused of non-lethal drug crimes, according to a database compiled by the Berlin-based European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) and Reprieve, which monitors Saudi media and speaks to families.\n \n\n   \n  Many were foreigners: Egyptian, Somali or Ethiopian migrant workers drawn by the kingdom’s economic allure and later trapped in its justice system. In 2024 the kingdom executed 345 people, rights groups say, double the rate of the past few years.\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming its de facto leader in 2017, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials, MBS, has sought to modernize the kingdom at a breath-taking rate. Seasoned visitors describe the country as almost unrecognizable. He has neutralized the religious police, abolished flogging, allowed women to drive, and will host soccer’s 2034 FIFA World Cup. His country has flown in musicians and sports stars from across the globe and launched world-famous festivals.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all in a bid to attract Western tourists and capital as he embarks on an ambitious economic transformation plan, dubbed Vision 2030.\n \n\n   \n  That plan will be high on his agenda when he travels to Washington DC this week, his first visit in seven years. He will be seeking American commitments to the kingdom’s economy and defense, and a high-profile US-Saudi investment summit is set to take place on November 19.\n \n\n   \n  Few expect human rights to feature prominently when the two meet. But campaigners warn that the PR drive is masking a dark reality back home – and the crown prince’s closeness to Trump is giving him free rein.\n \n\n   \n  Despite MBS saying back in 2018 that the kingdom was  working on minimizing executions , Saudi Arabia continues to execute more people than almost any other country on earth, with the exception of Iran and China, observers and rights groups say.\n \n\n   \n  CNN spoke with four sources close to the families of people who have either been executed or are on death row, facilitated by the international nonprofit Reprieve, and the ESOHR, to bring their stories to light. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution against the families.\n \n\n   \n  Some cases belie the images of a modern nation – in one, a Saudi woman and a Yemeni man were executed after being accused of kidnapping babies to  practice sorcery .\n \n\n   \n  Rights groups have been sounding the alarm. At the current pace of executions, they say, Saudi Arabia is on track to break its record again this year.\n \n\n   \n  Several foreign nationals remain in the same Tabuk prison where Saad was held. Among them is Essam al-Shazly, a 27-year-old Egyptian fisherman on death row for smuggling amphetamines and 1.8g of a substance “thought to be heroin,” according to legal documents seen by CNN. A person close to the family says he wasn’t aware of what was on the boat when boarding.\n \n\n   \n  “The family had been searching for two months for him. It wasn’t until they received a phone call from him in prison they knew what happened,” the person said.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to UN special rapporteurs dated in January,  the Saudi government rejected allegations  of secret executions, unfair trials and the mistreatment of foreign prisoners. It called the claims inaccurate, saying that bodies of those executed are returned to embassies and that official notices are published by the Saudi Press Agency.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia also said all capital cases pass through three levels of judicial review: trial, appeal and Supreme Court, before being approved by royal decree. It denied allegations of discrimination or torture, saying all prisoners are treated equally and that foreign nationals have consular access and that the death penalty is reserved “for the most serious crimes and in extremely limited circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Kingdom’s Ministry of Media for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups and sources close to the defendants say prisoners are not always given legal representation and when they are, it rarely changes the outcome of the case.\n \n\n   \n  Accounts from Tabuk prison, relayed to CNN by people close to those incarcerated, describe prisoners on death row waiting each morning to hear if their name will be called, signaling their execution that day.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Saudi Arabia thinks it has carte blanche’\n \n\n   \n  Further east, in Dammam, two young Shiite men are on death row: Hassan Zaki al-Faraj and Jawad and  Abdullah  Qureiris, now in their twenties. Both were arrested and sentenced to death for crimes committed as teenagers during the Arab Spring, rights groups and people close to their families said.\n \n\n   \n  Sources close to al-Faraj’s family say police raided his home in 2017, beat the men inside and detained them. He and his father remain in custody.\n \n\n   \n  The ESOHR says Qureiris was accused of attending a funeral that officials classified as an illegal protest and spent 270 days in solitary confinement upon detention.  CNN previously reported that his younger  brother, Murtaja, was on death row aged 13 on similar charges and  later released .\n \n\n   \n  Critics say the Trump administration has chosen to prioritize trade and weapons sales over human rights. In May, Riyadh and Washington announced a  $142 billion arms deal , part of a wider $600 billion commitment for energy, infrastructure and technology development.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also chose Riyadh for the first foreign visit of his first and second terms as president, which preceded the more than  $2 trillion in wider Gulf investment pledges to the United States .\n \n\n   \n  Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi scholar based in London, told CNN: “Saudi society has been silenced, especially with Trump’s return… Saudi Arabia thinks it has carte blanche.”\n \n\n   \n  The crown prince is “a ruler who believes he can do whatever he wants,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the US-based rights group DAWN. “He enjoys (a) complete lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “(The executions) are meant to instil fear and show that the consequences for behavior deemed unacceptable by the Saudi government are severe and harsh,” Whitson said.\n \n\n   \n  For prisoners like Hassan al-Faraj, Jawad Qureiris, and Essam al-Shazly, and their families, the painful wait continues.  They count the weeks between short phone calls, the months between updates. All dread hearing the worst.\n \n\n   \n  “It is hard to overstate how cruel and how cynical this regime is. It’s a system of lies and brutality,” said Jeed Basyouni, head of Reprieve’s death penalty team for the Middle East and North Africa. “The lies start at the top, with Mohammed bin Salman telling journalists he plans to reduce the use of capital punishment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/equity-stakes-government-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Uncle Sam is outperforming the S&P 500","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has invested in several critical U.S. companies — including Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals — to secure strategic supply chains amid growing trade tensions with China.

outperforming the S&P 500 \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration is investing in publicly traded companies — and it’s sending stocks soaring higher.\n \n\n   \n  Under President Donald Trump, the US government has taken equity stakes in companies including Intel ( INTC ), MP Materials ( MP ), Lithium Americas ( LAC ) and Trilogy Metals ( TMQ ). Investing in public companies is an unusual move that has sparked debate on Wall Street and Capitol Hill about whether the government should be interfering in markets.\n \n\n   \n  Proponents say the equity stakes are a strategic move to support companies in industries that are critical to national security, such as rare earths mining and the production of semiconductor chips. Critics, meanwhile, say it’s a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the government’s portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Markets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n \n\n   \n    Which companies is the US investing in?\n \n\n   \n  MP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company’s stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company’s largest shareholder.\n \n\n   \n  Intel, the  beleaguered chipmaker , announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.\n \n\n   \n  Trilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing an  enormous mining project in Alaska , announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a  10% equity stake  in Trilogy Metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a  “golden share”  in US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the government doing this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.\n \n\n   \n  China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.\n \n\n   \n  ‘Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,” James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company’s earnings call on November 6. “They are the front lines of security.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America’s national and economic security.”\n \n\n   \n  There is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.\n \n\n   \n  But the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,” Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n    What are some of the concerns?\n \n\n   \n  Skeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values — and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It’s also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.\n \n\n   \n  “There is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “You’re going to find people who are questioning, ‘Why are we doing this? We don’t need to risk our tax dollars.’”\n \n\n   \n  Scott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government’s purview.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t like the precedent that it sets going forward,” Ladner said. “These individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now — I don’t love that precedent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/12/middleeast/sick-palestinian-child-deport-israel-gaza-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"A death sentence for my son: Israel plans to deport sick Palestinians back to Gaza, patients and doctors say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli authorities are planning to deport sick Palestinian patients, including children and elderly individuals, back to Gaza despite the fact that Gaza’s healthcare system has been devastated—94% of hospitals are damaged or destroyed.

Zeena Saifi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:34 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Yamen Al-Najjar recalls his past life – the days when he went to school and laughed regularly. Today, the 16-year-old lives with his mother in a cramped 6-square-meter room, just large enough to hold a hospital bed he seldom leaves.\n \n\n   \n  “Life is hard. I am sick and in pain all the time… I feel alone, and I miss home,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen, who has a bleeding disorder, was medically evacuated from Gaza City with his mother to a Palestinian hospital in occupied East Jerusalem just two days before the October 7 attack in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  His condition is rare, according to his mother, Haifa Al-Najjar, and his doctors, who have struggled to manage his symptoms and been unable to get him the treatment he needs, even in East Jerusalem.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Najjar has been working to get her son medically evacuated to a third country for the last two years. She managed to get World Health Organization (WHO) approval for a medical transfer but has been looking for 14 months for a host country to accept her son for treatment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, she got news that she said made her heart stop. Doctors at Makassed Hospital told her that Israeli authorities had decided to send all Gazan patients back home the next week, even those who are currently undergoing treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “All my hard work will vanish before my eyes. I can’t comprehend how a sick child is going to be sent back to a disaster-stricken area… This is a death sentence for my son,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The family was informed on Sunday evening that Yamen’s name had been dropped from the list of patients to be deported on Monday morning, and that he would be allowed to stay for treatment for his chronic condition.\n \n\n   \n  But around 100 Gazan patients and their companions were still due for deportation, according to medical teams at Makassed Hospital and Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem and the Sheba-Tal Hasmomer hospital in Israel. They told CNN that while most patients have agreed to return to Gaza, some are being sent against their will as there is no treatment for them in the battered enclave. The WHO said last month that 94% of hospitals there have been  damaged or destroyed .\n \n\n   \n  The youngest of those being deported are babies born to women who were brought to Jerusalem for treatment, while the oldest is 85 years old, hospital authorities said. Most have been in the city since before the war.\n \n\n   \n  Salwa Massad, a research manager at WHO, told CNN that the organization had been asked by the Israeli military’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate the transfer of the patients.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out COGAT but has yet to receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  Yamen’s father, brother and two sisters are in Gaza, displaced in a tent camp in Al-Mawasi in the south after their home in Gaza City was bombed. He hasn’t seen them in two years.\n \n\n   \n  His mother said Yamen’s condition is so poor, he wouldn’t be able to survive in a tent even for a few hours without medical treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “His blood pressure fluctuates, his temperature is always low, he bleeds all the time, and he suffers from body aches… I categorically refuse to return to Gaza,” she said, tearful.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli non-profit Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) called the attempt to return patients to Gaza “unacceptable from moral, medical, and legal standpoints,”, pointing to Gaza’s “nonfunctional” healthcare system.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure that patients in need of medical care continue to receive it in the hospitals where they are currently admitted, or in any other hospital in Israel or abroad,” Aseel Aburass, director of the Occupied Territories Department at PHRI told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Aburass stressed the importance of this obligation, saying it was Israel itself that destroyed Gaza’s health care system and so “cannot now shirk its responsibility for the lives and health of these patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel’s parliament echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Yamen’s welfare is Israel’s responsibility.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending them back under the current conditions will be a death blow; instead of dying from an airstrike, he will die from being deprived of medical treatment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I will die there in two days’\n \n\n   \n  Nafez Al Qahwaji, from Khan Younis in Gaza, told CNN that he has kidney failure and needs dialysis three times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “The hospital informed us yesterday that we will all be deported back to Gaza, I was shocked to hear this after knowing the inhuman conditions that patients live in in Gaza,” he said at Makassed Hospital. “Why do they want to throw me to hell, I will die there in two days.” On Sunday evening, he was told his name was dropped from the deportation list and that he could remain at the hospital for his treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Nael Ezzeddine, from Jabalya, has not objected to returning. He has a heart condition and has been at Makassed Hospital for 25 months. He said his home in Gaza was struck by the Israeli military and that he lost everything, but his loved ones are waiting for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my family. I have 10 children and my wife – they are all displaced in a tent in Deir el-Balah. I want to go and be with them. I know how they suffer, but what will I do here?” he said. “They want to force us to leave, and they are threatening to send us back all the time… I’m tired of this. I just want to go to my family, even if I end up dying.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that sick patients from Gaza have faced this threat.\n \n\n   \n  In March 2024, Israeli authorities were preparing to send back 22 Palestinians from East Jerusalem to Gaza, including newborns and cancer patients. Israel’s Supreme Court then temporarily halted those plans following a petition by PHRI and a  CNN report  on the hospital patients.\n \n\n   \n  Most of Yamen’s paintings are colorful illustrations of nature, landscapes and Palestinian culture. He said his passion for art comes from his desire to “bring color back to a world that has turned gray.”\n \n\n   \n  “I miss my house, my siblings’ voices, my school, colors and the sea. I miss my toys that I gathered throughout my childhood, and every moment when Gaza was safe,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have suffered a lot and I just want to rest… I hope every child in Gaza lives like any child in the world… I don’t want any child to get sick or be afraid like me.”\n \n\n   \n   Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that most of the patients have agreed to return to Gaza. \n \n\n   \n   This story has also been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-epstein-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00-05:00","title":"What Marjorie Taylor Greene’s political revolt may say about Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent MAGA-aligned Republican representative from Georgia, has made a significant political shift by publicly apologizing for her role in fostering toxic political discourse, particularly in response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

say about Trump \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:37 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Marjorie Taylor Greene did something politicians almost never do: She said she was sorry.\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia representative on Sunday  repudiated her role  in inflaming the country’s poisoned politics in her latest  sharp break  with President Donald Trump and his provocative rhetoric, furthering her own intriguing political reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it’s very bad for our country,” Greene told CNN’s Dana Bash in a frank interview on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been working on this a lot lately — to put down the knives in politics. I really just want to see people be kind to one another. And we need to figure out a new path forward that is focused on the American people, because, as Americans, no matter what side of the aisle we’re on, we have far more in common than we have differences,” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, one of the highest-profile MAGA voices, explained that she’d been reflecting on her past political antics following the horrific assassination of conservative icon Charlie Kirk in September. And she fears her own safety is now in question. She wrote on X later on Sunday that “unwarranted and vicious attacks against” her by Trump “were a dog whistle to dangerous radicals” and that she was receiving multiple threats.\n \n\n   \n  Trump dismissed her concerns, telling reporters Sunday, “I don’t think her life is in danger. … Frankly, I don’t think anybody cares about her,” and referring to the Georgia lawmaker as “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene.”\n \n\n   \n  The breakup between Trump and Greene, one of his most enthusiastic supporters in the 2024 election, was worsened by her decision to sign on to a push in the House to release investigative files about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has furiously resisted the move. But on Sunday evening, he reversed his position, saying Republicans should call for the files’ release in a House vote this week. He  wrote on Truth Social , “we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s remarks earlier Sunday were notable for many reasons. First, the sight of a politician answering a question directly and expressing contrition was unusual. Bash asked Greene, who once heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, why she criticized toxic politics only when it was directed at her. “I think that’s fair criticism,”  Greene replied .\n \n\n   \n  Her reversal was also significant because she was once one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the stunts and stinging rhetoric that are central to MAGA politics and to Trump’s public statements. When she came to Washington after she was first elected in 2020, Greene was known for  promoting conspiracy theories , including over school shootings and the beliefs of the far-right QAnon movement.\n \n\n   \n  She later got into heated verbal confrontations with colleagues and even suggested a “national divorce” between red and blue states because of Democrats’ “traitorous America Last policies.” Critics have also warned that some of her rhetoric was  antisemitic .\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s comments Sunday were striking, too, because they deepened her split with Trump, in a rare example of a Republican lawmaker willing to publicly criticize the president, who has kept an iron grip on his party for nearly a decade and caused Republicans on Capitol Hill to abdicate their constitutional oversight role.\n \n\n   \n    Greene’s critiques extend beyond Epstein\n \n\n   \n  But Greene has not just criticized Trump over Epstein. In recent weeks, she’s raised alarms about the cost of living and slammed her party for not doing more to alleviate the rising cost of  health insurance , after she said premiums for her adult children were set to double.\n \n\n   \n  And in another dramatic break with the president, she has even argued that he’s not being faithful to the “America First” principles of the political movement that he created, criticizing his foreign tours and meetings with foreign leaders like Syria’s president, who visited last week. “I would love to see Air Force One be parked and stay home and there be nothing but a constant focus in the White House on a domestic agenda that helps the American people once and for all,” Greene said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s evolution has revealed her as a politician who is more subtle than she first appeared, and who is increasingly adept at wielding her own power. And it has played into a deepening sense that Trump, surrounded by obsequious officials and billionaires, and who seems obsessed with physical manifestations of his legacy — including  a new White House ballroom  — is out of touch with American public opinion and even the voters who sent him back to the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s calls for the release of the Epstein files fanned Trump’s public rage and sharpened questions about why he had been so unwilling to allow the release of material that sex trafficking victims want made public. Trump was once a friend of Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019, but there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the president.\n \n\n   \n  All of this has raised questions in Washington about whether there are ulterior motives behind Greene’s conversion. After all, it is rare for a leading political figure to confound their own caricature and to disown their own past behavior. Trump, for instance, has lived by a mantra of never apologizing for anything and never leaving an attack unanswered.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s explanation that she reconsidered her own behavior after the Kirk assassination sounds genuine and could serve as an example at a time of fraught national tensions. The killing of the Turning Point USA activist was a traumatic experience for the MAGA movement and for all Americans, and came a year after two assassination attempts against Trump. It ought to lead to political reflection.\n \n\n   \n    Greene denies her political change was motivated by thwarted ambition\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s warnings about the cost of living also ring true and suggest she is living in the real world rather than the rarified community of wealth that the president inhabits.\n \n\n   \n  But might she also be making a shrewd political move at a time when Trump is becoming increasingly unpopular? Her strategy is not without political risk, with the president saying he’d support a primary challenge against her. But Greene presumably has a strong read on opinions within the 14th Congressional District in northwest Georgia that she represents. She also, thanks to her visibility, has an independent power base.\n \n\n   \n  Her willingness to separate herself from Trump is a threat to the cohesion of the GOP in the House and an indicator of the party’s fragile majority, which numbers just a few votes.\n \n\n   \n  Such a slim margin gives individual lawmakers great power — as has been shown by Greene’s signing on to a discharge position with three other GOP members to force a vote on the Epstein files led by dissident conservative  Rep. Thomas Massie  of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and other Greene critics have argued that thwarted ambition is behind her criticism of him. The president said in a Truth Social post in which he withdrew his support for “‘Wacky’ Marjorie” that he had told her not to run for governor of Georgia or for a Senate seat.\n \n\n   \n  One of Greene’s Democratic adversaries, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has made similar claims about the Senate. But Greene said Sunday she didn’t want to serve anywhere but the House. “I don’t want to have anything to do with the Senate,” Greene said. She cited the chamber’s role in the government shutdown and said she’d also decided she didn’t want to run for governor. But if Greene changes her position on seeking a statewide office in future, or even launches a presidential run, a more moderate political profile might help her win over a wider swath of voters.\n \n\n   \n  Some of Greene’s critics might argue that while she has changed her public persona — by seeking out audiences outside conservative media, for instance, on ABC’s “The View” — her politics remain hardline and her MAGA views are undiluted. She said on CNN on Sunday that she still supports Trump, his administration and his campaign promises. Greene’s views are shared by millions of Americans. But perhaps a more civil dialogue is possible between MAGA conservatives and progressives after years of a national estrangement that only seems to be getting more extreme.\n \n\n   \n  Cynics will watch to see whether Greene’s less volcanic brand of dialogue lasts in Washington’s bitter cauldron. Others might suspect her fracture with Trump will be temporary. The president has had plenty of feuds with people who later reemerge in his orbit. And Greene wore a red MAGA hat with the slogan “Trump was Right About Everything” to his speech to a joint session of Congress earlier this year. “I certainly hope that we can make up,” she told Bash.\n \n\n   \n  But if the fracture is permanent, it will point to an emerging political theme. Greene’s most radical criticism of the president is that he’s no longer embodying “America First” values. This implicitly suggests the movement is distinct from the president himself, something he disagrees with.\n \n\n   \n  “Considering that I’m the one that developed ‘America First,’ and considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that,” Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump doesn’t take kindly to criticism and views any perceived disloyalty as treachery. These traits have become even more pronounced in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But Greene’s rupture with him is just the latest hint that members of his party are beginning to assess his behavior and how it might weigh on their fortunes when he no longer controls the GOP. Massie has been arguing to Republicans that they will have to account for votes not to release the Epstein files in future campaign debates. “I would remind my colleagues that this vote is going to be on your record for longer than Trump is going to be president,” he told CNN last week.\n \n\n   \n  And Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy pointed out in a conversation with CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that while he didn’t consider Trump a lame duck, “In this instance, I think the Constitution is pretty clear that a president, whomever it might be, can only serve two terms.” His comment followed speculation from Trump supporters that the president would try to run again.\n \n\n   \n  The shift in perspective about Trump is still barely perceptible. He’s only in the first year of his second term, and most Republicans still don’t dare to defy him. But amid some of the worst approval ratings of his presidency, there are growing signs some Republicans are beginning to contemplate how to prepare for a political future without him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/arctic-frost-provision-funding-bill","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"What to know about the controversial ‘Arctic Frost’ provision tucked into the funding bill that’s dividing GOP lawmakers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A controversial provision in a government funding bill, known as the 'Arctic Frost' provision, requires the Justice Department and FBI to notify senators when their personal data is subpoenaed or they are under investigation.

controversial ‘Arctic Frost’ provision tucked into the funding bill that’s dividing GOP lawmakers \n       \n  By Morgan Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The bill that ended the government shutdown included a provision requiring the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers can also sue the DOJ under the provision, and can be awarded $500,000 or more in damages for each violation by the government if their cases are successful.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called “Arctic Frost,” which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Donald Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register Electoral College votes for Trump from states that former President Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  The provision sparked bipartisan furor on Capitol Hill as critics called it a self-serving measure that would enrich senators at taxpayers’ expense.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans ultimately voted for the funding bill to bring an end to the historic 43-day shutdown. Now, they say they’ll introduce a standalone bill to repeal it.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the controversy on Capitol Hill:\n \n\n   \n    What’s in this provision?\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans accuse former special counsel Jack Smith and FBI leaders of having political motives for obtaining phone records of nine GOP lawmakers with grand jury subpoenas.\n \n\n   \n  The records contain data from four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The records do not include the content of calls. Smith has said the subpoenas were part of routine investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The language that Trump  signed into law  as part of the stopgap funding bill explicitly lays out the various situations and parameters by which federal investigators are required to notify Congress, including when personal electronic records of senators are subpoenaed, when a senator is a target in a criminal investigation, and when data from a Senate office is needed.\n \n\n   \n  It also says that any senator who is not notified about their data being used in an investigation or that they are the target of an investigation may file a lawsuit saying that investigators did not comply with federal law.\n \n\n   \n  “Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency,” the legislation says.\n \n\n   \n  The law applies retroactively to 2022.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Republicans saying about it?\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that he had been blindsided by the measure added to the bill by Senate Republicans and that the House GOP would draft a separate bill to strike the language, which would come to the floor at a future date.\n \n\n   \n  The issue first drew attention at a House Rules Committee meeting, when the panel was weighing the funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole said he was “surprised” to see the provision. Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the committee, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, slammed it, saying it would provide millions of dollars to the senators investigated in a probe around the fake elector scheme from the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Reps. Austin Scott, Chip Roy and Morgan Griffith said during the meeting that they are concerned with a provision. “I’ve been asking questions on this since last night, and I’ll tell you, I don’t think that Senate leadership shared with the leadership of the House what they were doing,” Scott said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Scott later told CNN: “I think it’s poorly worded, but I’m glad that other people were paying attention and read the legislation and was able to explain to the American citizens what’s in it.”\n \n\n   \n  A number of House Republicans already support stripping the language.\n \n\n   \n  “That was stupid, quite honestly, to put that language in this bill,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls said.\n \n\n   \n    How are the ‘Arctic Frost’ senators reacting?\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Republican senators whose phone records were seized as part of Arctic Frost say they won’t seek monetary damages, amid fierce backlash to the provision that allows them to sue.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Sen. Dan Sullivan, one of the senators whose phone records were seized in Smith’s probe, told CNN on Friday “he does not plan on suing and is supportive of the House bill to repeal the provision.” The aide noted the senator first learned of it while reviewing the funding deal.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Bill Hagerty said in an X  post  on Thursday that he was “for accountability for Jack Smith and everyone complicit in this abuse of power,” then added, “I do not want and I am not seeking damages for myself paid for with taxpayer dollars.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Josh Hawley also called for accountability but referred to the measure as “a bad idea.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think the Senate provision is a bad idea. There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ’s outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s office told  WBIR  this week she intended to sue. In a statement to CNN on Friday, her office said, “Senator Blackburn’s plan has always been to seek a declaratory judgment—not monetary damages—to prevent leftists from violating the constitutional rights of conservatives.”\n \n\n   \n  Blackburn, who is running for Tennessee governor in 2026, is also facing pressure from GOP Rep. John Rose, who is making a bid as well. He decried the provision this week as a “poison pill.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN in a statement he has “no plans at this time” to sue, adding, “If I did sue, it would only be for the purpose of using the courts to expose the corrupt weaponization of federal law enforcement by the Biden and Obama administrations. With the full cooperation in our congressional investigations from the Trump DOJ and FBI, that shouldn’t be necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  He has previously said that he supports the provision “as a deterrent to prevent future misuse of federal agencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tommy Tuberville said in an X  post  on Thursday he would sue if a federal judge involved in the probe didn’t face impeachment and Smith wasn’t disbarred and jailed. He wrote, “If they aren’t, I will sue the living hell out of every Biden official involved in this to make sure this NEVER happens to a conservative again.”\n \n\n   \n  He did not say what kind of relief he would seek.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is forswearing monetary compensation.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lindsey Graham embraced the provision while speaking with reporters in South Carolina  on Wednesday, telling them he is “very much for the idea that if you’ve been wronged there should be a remedy.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he would file a lawsuit, he responded, “Oh, definitely. And if you think I’m going to settle this thing for a million dollars? No. I want to make it so painful, no one ever does this again.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to his office on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the office of Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Where does the Senate stand?\n \n\n   \n  Following a backlash from House Republicans about the inclusion in the government spending of a provision that would allow senators to sue the Department of Justice if their phone records are obtained without their knowledge, a GOP Senate source familiar defended the legislation as appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  The person, granted anonymity to talk freely about the thinking behind the provision, pointed to a carveout if a senator is under criminal investigation and other rationale for the move. The source declined to comment on the political fallout and what the Senate might do with legislation House Republicans plan to move to undo the policy.\n \n\n   \n  They detailed:\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  Eyes are on the House, which is expected to bring a bill that would nullify the provision.\n \n\n   \n  If that bill passes the House, it remains to be seen if and when Senate GOP Leader John Thune would bring it to the floor for a vote.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/europe/ukraine-wine-winemakers-tradition-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Wine has long been made in Ukraine.

Now its winemakers are preserving tradition in the face of war \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Sergiy Klimov speaks about wine, his excitement is infectious, even to those with a less than sophisticated palate.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2014, Klimov has championed Ukrainian-made wine in numerous ways.\n \n\n   \n  He runs a chain of wine bars in the capital city, Kyiv, stocking only Ukrainian-produced wine. He is an ambassador for Ukrainian wine, promoting it overseas. And now he has his own vineyard in the village of Zarichanka in western Ukraine, where he experiments with grape cultivation and the winemaking process.\n \n\n   \n  Through sharing Ukrainian-made wine, Klimov feels he is  preserving and building on a tradition  connected to his ancestral land for thousands of years.\n \n\n   \n  “It became my mission,” he said. “I want to bring revolution to the industry.”\n \n\n   \n  Alongside its neighbors Moldova and Romania, and the wider region’s Georgia and Azerbaijan, Ukraine has been fertile winemaking ground for millennia. Archaeological digs have unearthed ancient Greek winemaking vessels, while fossilized remains of grape species found during other excavations date back to the 11th to 9th centuries BC.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most famously, Crimea was home to vineyards which sat at the foot of the southern peninsula’s mountains. After Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 many of the vineyards were lost and, in some cases, were mined and destroyed by Russian forces, said Anna Eugenia Yanchenko, a Ukrainian cultural scientist, sommelier, and wine researcher specializing in the history of her country’s wine.\n \n\n   \n  Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, its forces have destroyed more wineries, including Château Kurin in the south and ARTWINERY in the eastern city of Donetsk, Yanchenko said. Others, like the southern vineyard Prince Trubetskoy Winery and the Kyiv region’s Wineidea, experienced periods of occupation.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s winemaking capacity was significantly reduced as a result – but Klimov and others are determined to keep the industry not just alive but thriving.\n \n\n   \n  Their efforts are motivated in part by a desire to strengthen  Ukrainian national identity  in the face of Russia’s efforts to deny their country’s sovereignty.\n \n\n   \n  Now based in Warsaw, Poland, Yanchenko says little is known about who originally planted grapes millennia ago in what is now Ukraine, but that what matters is that it happened and that production continues.\n \n\n   \n  “Since winemaking appeared, the process of cultivating grapes and wine consumption has never ended here,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Another champion for the industry is Tania Olevska, who left Ukraine for London in July 2022, five months after Russia’s full-scale invasion. Having worked in the wine industry for some years in her native Ukraine, she decided to establish Ukrainian Wines Company UK, focused on importing Ukrainian wines to Britain. She attends wine fairs and exhibitions that winemakers who remain in Ukraine now struggle to get to.\n \n\n   \n  “Initially, the wines were rejected,” Olevska said of trying to rally interest. But after one Ukrainian winemaker sent two cases to be sampled at events, that all changed. “In 2023, we had an opportunity to showcase our wines at the London Wine Fair. Several winemakers came and there was a huge interest from the trade side. They liked the wines,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wine enthusiast Klimov is not surprised by that. “Our territory is super-unique,” he said, explaining how the diversity of Ukraine’s landscape lends itself to complex and interesting flavors, “We have black soils, limestone, volcanic soil and more than 400 grape varieties,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Victoria Daskal, a wine writer and educator based in London, said she believes the rise in Ukrainian wine imports to the UK is in part due to awareness of the war, but also because of the diversity of the British wine market. “Many wine consumers are generally surprised to even learn that Ukraine is a wine-producing country, but they are interested in exploring new regions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Ukrainian winemakers have some way to go to raise the profile of their vintages both globally and at home.\n \n\n   \n  Both Klimov and Yanchenko explained how the Soviet era limited the wine industry, when they said quantity was prioritized over quality.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, the Russian Empire’s ineffective tackling of grape phylloxera – an aphid-like pest which feeds on grapevine roots – caused great loss in Ukraine, as elsewhere in 19th-century Europe. The wine industry had also long been affected by uncertainty, as portions of the country came under the rule of invading nations including Lithuania, Poland and Russia between the 14 th  and 18 th  centuries before it fell entirely to Russian rule.\n \n\n   \n  In the 20 th  century, the Soviets brought everything into government ownership. Wine was still produced, but privately owned wineries were destroyed and replaced with mass manufacturing with no concern for quality. Ukraine’s winemaking reputation was quickly ruined, Yanchenko said.\n \n\n   \n  Now in the grips of another war, Ukraine is committed to defending its identity as a sovereign nation – an identity Russia is seeking to erase in the regions it has occupied,  rights groups say. \n \n\n   \n  That erasure is also reminiscent of the Soviet era, when the regime in Moscow controlled the historical narrative. “My parents didn’t learn much about the history of our land in school,” Yanchenko said. “We know so little about who we are. But through discoveries like the true history of winemaking we are slowly piecing together the bigger picture of ‘Who are Ukrainians?’”\n \n\n   \n  Which might be why when Klimov saw an opportunity to get his neighbors involved in winemaking, he seized it.\n \n\n   \n  “Kyiv is the capital of vertical vineyards,” he said, describing how grapevines, many of them planted in the early 20th century, still grow through the city’s buildings in certain areas.\n \n\n   \n  In late 2023, he called upon his neighbors to join him in collecting and contributing grapes grown on Kyiv’s streets and soon they’d gathered 200 kilograms (about 440 pounds) of the fruit.\n \n\n   \n  The result was 100 bottles of natural wine with low intervention, bottled and sold with a label designed by Ukrainian artist Waone. “It’s like a piece of art that never existed before,” Klimov said.\n \n\n   \n  All proceeds from the sales are donated to funds supporting Ukraine’s armed forces, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to show that Ukraine is a wine country. It has old roots, with wine on our streets,” Klimov said, adding that he hopes to make this communal effort a tradition.\n \n\n   \n  Yanchenko hopes the work she, and Klimov, now do to advocate for Ukrainian wines at home and overseas will re-shape the country’s image.\n \n\n   \n  “It serves as a bridge, connecting us to other nations by offering a taste of our history, traditions, and the uniqueness of our land,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a way to reconnect with our roots and proudly share what makes Ukraine truly special.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite some people’s doubts, Klimov says some Ukrainians are now starting to choose Ukraine-made products over international imports.\n \n\n   \n  Having attended wine fairs in Dusseldorf, London and other European cities, Klimov also says he has seen a shift in the tastes of non-Ukrainians, with more becoming interested in learning about Ukraine’s wine regions.\n \n\n   \n  According to Olevska, “People should try Ukrainian wines, not just because of the war, not just because of this grief, but just because it’s a good wine of a great quality, and it’s worth being on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Klimov feels that investing his time and expertise in this industry will support his nation’s wider war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “When you support Ukraine’s economy, you support Ukraine’s culture, and this is a very small step that everyone in this world can do for Ukraine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/us/charlotte-north-carolina-immigration-border-patrol","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Charlotte Becomes Latest Target of DHS Immigration Blitz, Sparking Widespread Fear and Political Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Charlotte, North Carolina, became a surprise target of a Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement operation in November 2025, with 81 individuals arrested under a campaign dubbed 'Charlotte’s Web.'

Locals say it’s political \n       \n  By Zoe Sottile, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With dozens of people arrested in North Carolina’s largest city during the Department of Homeland Security’s  latest targeted immigration blitz , one question has emerged for many of its residents and leaders: Why Charlotte?\n \n\n   \n  The city hadn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like  Chicago  and  Los Angeles . It’s a Democrat-led city, but it’s hundreds of miles away from either the northern or southern border. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%,  according to data  released by the city in October.\n \n\n   \n  Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte – right off the heels of a weekslong operation that led to  hundreds of arrests  and  fierce protests  in Chicago – provoked fear and anxiety in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation – which came as a surprise to local officials – as a political distraction ahead of next year’s  midterm elections .\n \n\n   \n  “This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are hoping to flip one of North Carolina’s Senate seats after Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis  pulled out of the race  following criticism from the president who threatened to back a primary challenger to Tillis’ seat. Former North Carolina Gov.  Roy Cooper , who is widely popular across the state,  launched  his campaign in July.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, state Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat, characterized the operation as a Republican political stunt. “The truth is, this move from the federal government, and the silence from GOP state leaders enabling it, are part of the same political distraction,” he said in a statement to CNN. “They’re trying to shift attention away from their own failures, because they have no plan to lower costs, make housing affordable, or expand real opportunity for working people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the surge would “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency claimed “nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored – releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods.” Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” but it is a  “Certified Welcoming City,”  a designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration into the city has increased in recent years. Around 18.2% of the city’s population was foreign-born in 2023, according to  US Census data , around double that of North Carolina at large. And there have been disagreements in the city in the past about immigration enforcement. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decadelong  287(g) partnership  with ICE in 2018, to the chagrin of Republican officials.\n \n\n   \n  The city became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democrat-led cities in September, after  a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee  was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.\n \n\n   \n  Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte,  asked the governor  earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.\n \n\n   \n  Top Border Patrol official  Gregory Bovino , who is from North Carolina, has his own answer. In  an Instagram post  with a photo of a man he claimed was an “illegal alien with a violent criminal history,” he wrote, “This is why border security matters. This is why we’re in Charlotte.”\n \n\n   \n    Weekend of turmoil\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in Charlotte on Saturday, Bovino  said Sunday , in an operation DHS dubbed “Charlotte’s Web.” He didn’t specify the reasons for the arrests or the names of those arrested but said many had “significant criminal and immigration history.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino – who was criticized by a federal judge over  his and his agents’ use of force  in Chicago – was spotted on video during the detainment of a person outside a grocery store in Pineville, around 10 miles south of Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  A man with  a REAL ID  who says he became a US citizen in 2019 was caught in the fray. Federal agents smashed the car window of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduran immigrant who lives in Charlotte, and then detained him before letting him go a little while later. Medina said he pleaded with federal agents to look at his ID after the arrest.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, a Customs and Border Patrol agent said that officers had “approached an individual who acted increasingly erratic. The individual escalated the situation and refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson, in a Saturday interview with CNN, said there’s “fear and anxiety rampant” across the city.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Migrant Network, a legal advocacy nonprofit, said it had seen federal agents in “camouflage and tactical gear operating out of unmarked vehicles” – a sight that has  become characteristic  of DHS’ operations across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “We have also witnessed an escalation in hostile actions, including the arrest of U.S. citizens, physical assaults on community members, and the disruption of places of worship, businesses, and restaurants where people have been questioned about their immigration status,” said the group in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to questions about the nonprofit’s claims but sent CNN a statement including the photos and names of people it said were immigrants with criminal histories released in North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters decrying the operation filled a Charlotte park Saturday, then marched through the streets of uptown.\n \n\n   \n    Businesses close as Border Patrol agents arrive\n \n\n   \n  Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.\n \n\n   \n  Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he’s started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don’t want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I’m going to be back home tonight.”\n \n\n   \n  Betancur said he doesn’t want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents – not when they’re just trying to buy cakes or pastries.\n \n\n   \n  A company that manages several bars and restaurants in Charlotte said it closed its properties Saturday night after DHS’s announcement. Dubai Nightlife Charlotte cited the “safety, peace of mind and protection of those who visit us” in making the “preventative” decision, according to a Facebook post in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce of the Carolinas also  announced  it was postponing an event scheduled for Saturday “due to recent action to bolster immigration operations in several cities across the country.”\n \n\n   \n    Deployment surprised local officials\n \n\n   \n  The announcement that Charlotte would be the next city targeted by federal immigration officials  was unexpected  – including for local government.\n \n\n   \n  None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of the plan.\n \n\n   \n  City Council member Malcolm Graham, who said he was unaware of the planned operation before CNN called him, said, “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans. McFadden said Thursday afternoon two federal officials contacted him about the arrival of Border Patrol agents but said details on the federal operation had not been shared with the sheriff’s office and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  Even the operation’s name has attracted controversy: Martha White, the granddaughter of “Charlotte’s Web” author E.B. White and his literary executor, decried it as an attempt to ride the beloved children book’s “coattails without permission” in a statement to CNN. Her grandfather, she said, “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein noted  in a statement on social media  that Border Patrol has detained many people without criminal histories in Chicago. He urged residents to use their phones to record “if you see something bad happening.”\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement will be here protecting the people of this state long after these federal agents go on to the next place,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, suggested Charlotte’s growing immigrant population as a possible reason the city is being targeted. The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said. The move could also be seen as “retaliation” for the sheriff’s decision to end collaboration with ICE, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a level of, ‘let’s add another city to a roster, create some havoc, and move on’ as well,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans welcome surge\n \n\n   \n  Some of the state and city’s Republicans, meanwhile, have welcomed the surge.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once,” NCGOP Communications Director Matt Mercer said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Kyle Kirby, the chair of Mecklenburg County’s GOP, told CNN he believed Charlotte was targeted because of its large immigration court and the sheriff’s refusal to work with ICE. “When local leaders release individuals flagged for federal pickup back into the community, it simply forces federal agencies to step in,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  At least one Republican had more mixed feelings. Ed Driggs, who, after Democrats flipped a seat in this month’s election, will be the lone Republican on Charlotte’s City Council next year, said early in the week he was surprised to learn it was Border Patrol being sent to Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m conflicted. I have a hard line on identifying and deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes, but I’m not sure this is the way to do it,” said Driggs. “That’s the right thing to do, deport violent criminals. But they are running over local government and it’s causing concern from legal people, legal Americans and legal immigrants.”\n \n\n   \n  Driggs said if there were more local coordination ahead of time – instead of finding out through “anonymous media sources” – the Border Patrol operation may not have been met with such initial fear and confusion from the city’s residents.\n \n\n   \n  “The involvement of people who are elected locally gives residents, legal residents, comfort. Otherwise this could feel like an invasion.”\n \n\n   \n    New Orleans is next, sources say\n \n\n   \n  Bovino’s crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democrat-led cities after Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democrat-led city in a Republican-led state,  as far back as September . He said the city has a “crime problem.” But the National Guard plan hasn’t materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in  Chicago  and  Portland  have largely been stymied by the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Neither have the president’s ideas to send troops to  Baltimore  and  New York .\n \n\n   \n  The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia – before the Charlotte operation was officially announced – Bovino floated a few cities that Border Patrol could head to next.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re going to see us redeploy to – it could be New York, it could be Chicago, it could be Charlotte.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/17/middleeast/us-gaza-israel-un-vote-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-05:00","title":"A US plan for Gaza with big ambition and scant detail faces crucial UN vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US-backed plan to establish a two-year transitional Board of Peace (BoP) in Gaza, based on Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan, is set for a crucial vote in the UN Security Council.

AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UN Security Council is scheduled to vote Monday on a resolution to take  Gaza  beyond the fragile truce that took effect last month to a more sustainable peace and reconstruction.\n \n\n   \n  Its central features are a Board of Peace to run  Gaza  for a two-year period, supported by international forces and Palestinian police trained by Egypt. The Board would oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other factions – a key Israeli demand - and the reconstruction of Gaza, according to a draft of the resolution seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution builds on US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan unveiled in September but is already running into opposition from some in the Israeli government and may face a veto by either Russia or China – or both - when it comes to the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has put forward an alternative plan. And a veto from one of the permanent members of the Security Council would leave the plan in limbo, if not virtually dead in the water.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution is also vague on sequencing and detail.  Western diplomatic sources told CNN that the lack of detail in the resolution will make it hard to put into effect and are pessimistic that even if it passes, the current ceasefire will hold.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of its essential proposals, according to the draft.\n \n\n   \n    Governance in Gaza\n \n\n   \n  The resolution calls for “the establishment of the Board of Peace (BoP) as a transitional administration with international legal personality.”\n \n\n   \n  This is Trump’s idea for interim governance in Gaza. The resolution says it will coordinate the redevelopment of Gaza in accordance with what’s called the Comprehensive Plan – Trump’s 20-point blueprint.\n \n\n   \n  It’s as yet unclear who would serve on the BoP and just what its powers would be, according to diplomats familiar with the process.\n \n\n   \n  Former British Prime Minister  Tony Blair  was at one point being suggested as leading the board under Trump’s chairmanship, despite his damaged standing among some Arab states over his support for the Iraq war, and the feeling among many Palestinians that he is pro-Israel.\n \n\n   \n  According to Israeli officials last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Board would have no representatives of the Palestinian Authority, a rival to Hamas that runs parts of the occupied West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  “Israel and the US are the ones who decide if it will meet the conditions, and there’s an entire wall of conditions,” he was  quoted  as saying.\n \n\n   \n    Foreign troops\n \n\n   \n  The BoP along with member states would stand up a “temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza to deploy under unified command,” according to the draft, in close consultation with Israel and Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  It would ensure “the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” according to the draft.\n \n\n   \n  As the ISF “establishes control and stability,” the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.”\n \n\n   \n  This is – in short – a hornet’s nest. The sequencing will be hard to manage, and the ISF will have to carry out the complex task of disarming Hamas and other factions, which still retain an array of rockets and heavy weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Some Hamas officials continue to rule out disarmament of the group’s military wing. Hamas fighters would be reluctant to give up light weapons to protect themselves from other groups in Gaza seeking retribution.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu has said that the BoP must take charge of Hamas’ disarmament and on Sunday reiterated that “Gaza will be demilitarized, and Hamas will be disarmed — either the easy way or the hard way.”\n \n\n   \n  Several countries have been tipped as likely contributors to an ISF in Gaza, including Indonesia, Turkey and Egypt. But none has committed a contingent, and there has been little public discussion about a command structure, nor about the ISF’s relationship with a Palestinian police force being trained in Egypt.\n \n\n   \n  Israel would very likely reject a Turkish role.\n \n\n   \n  The Americans themselves won’t contribute boots on the ground and are struggling to assemble an international force willing to enter Gaza to demilitarize the strip, according to an Israeli official. The US is now considering skipping over the demilitarization stage and moving straight to reconstruction, the official told CNN. Such a move would infuriate Israel because it would leave Hamas with its weaponry.\n \n\n   \n  That would undermine Washington’s own UN resolution and is unacceptable to Israel, the official said. The US was “moving toward interim solutions that Israel cannot accept.”\n \n\n   \n    The Palestinian role in Gaza\n \n\n   \n  According to the draft resolution, the BoP would at some point hand over to the Palestinian Authority (PA), when it “has satisfactorily completed its reform program.”\n \n\n   \n  The draft does not expand on what those reforms should be but refers to a joint  French-Saudi plan  that includes a commitment by the PA “to hold democratic and transparent general and presidential elections within a year” of the ceasefire in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, President Emmanuel Macron said France would help the Palestinian Authority draft a constitution for a future Palestinian state, part of a broader effort to promote a two-state solution.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government wants a civilian administration in Gaza that is led by neither the PA nor Hamas. But it would be hard to find enough qualified Palestinians without allegiance to either group to lead the reconstruction of Gaza.\n \n\n   \n    A Palestinian State?\n \n\n   \n  The elephant in the room.\n \n\n   \n  The resolution says that depending on the PA’s progress “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.  The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”\n \n\n   \n  There are plenty of caveats in the phrasing but the pathway remains a possibility, something the Trump administration discounted in its early days.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government has made it clear it will not accept a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu repeated that “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory west of the Jordan River exists, remains in force, and has not changed in the slightest.”\n \n\n   \n  Some far-right ministers have gone further. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Sunday: “There is no such thing as a ‘Palestinian people.’ It is an invention with no historical, archaeological, or factual basis.”\n \n\n   \n  Saudi Arabia, which is expected to have a major role in financing the reconstruction of Gaza, takes the opposite view. Its powerful crown prince meets Trump this week.\n \n\n   \n  Saudi minister Manal Radwan told a conference in Bahrain two weeks ago: “A Palestinian state is a prerequisite for regional integration.

and hard-right candidates \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:45 AM EST, Mon November 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Chile is headed to a tense presidential runoff after a  closely fought first-round  vote Sunday set up a showdown between a member of the Communist Party and an ultraconservative veteran politician, sharply polarizing the country between the political left and right.\n \n\n   \n  Jeannette Jara, 51, the communist former labor minister and candidate of Chile’s center-left governing coalition, claimed 26.7% of valid ballots with over 90% of the vote counted, failing to pass the 50% threshold to secure victory in the first round.\n \n\n   \n  José Antonio Kast, 59, a hard-right former lawmaker and devout Catholic opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion, captured more than 24.1% of the vote, underscoring the resilience of his law-and-order platform as a surge in organized crime rattles one of Latin America’s safest nations and foments anti-migrant sentiment among Chileans.\n \n\n   \n  After learning he would advance to the next round, Kast urged the fractured right-wing to unite behind him, framing the runoff as an existential struggle for Chile’s future.\n \n\n   \n  “It will be the most important election of our generation, a true referendum between two models of society — the current one that has led Chile to destruction, stagnation, violence,” he told fans, interrupted by cheers every few seconds. “And our model, which promotes freedom, hope and progress.”\n \n\n   \n  Jara had a very different message. “This is a great country,” she told supporters in downtown Santiago, the capital. “Don’t let fear freeze your hearts.”\n \n\n   \n    Crime, immigration boost the right\n \n\n   \n  An admirer of US President Donald Trump and Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro, Kast has vowed to deport tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and construct hundreds of kilometers of ditches and walls along Chile’s northern border with Bolivia to prevent people from crossing, particularly from crisis-stricken Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “We want change, and that change today is about security,” José Hernández, the 60-year-old owner of an agricultural company said after casting his ballot for Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Although voters gave Jara a slight edge on Sunday, Kast will benefit in the second round from a large share of votes that went to three eliminated right-wing challengers who campaigned aggressively on the need to tackle illegal immigration.\n \n\n   \n  The third- and fourth-placed candidates were Franco Parisi, a right-leaning populist economist with a large social media following, and Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian and former YouTube provocateur elected as lawmaker in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Chile’s constitution does not allow reelection to consecutive terms, so left-wing  President Gabriel Boric,  whose presidency ends in March, is not standing.\n \n\n   \n  Like her opponents, Jara has called insecurity a top priority, promoting plans to deport foreigners convicted of drug trafficking, boost security along Chile’s borders and tackle money laundering.\n \n\n   \n  “On the question of more jails, more punishments, more imprisonment, closing borders, restricting migrants, there is no debate anymore between the right and left,” said Lucía Dammert, a political scientist and Boric’s first chief of staff.\n \n\n   \n   “But it’s an issue that always enhances the right, everywhere in Latin America.”\n \n\n   \n    Winning over wary voters\n \n\n   \n  The race now goes to a second round on December 14. Analysts believe the starkly opposed Jara and Kast will tack to the middle ground in order to broaden their appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “We will definitely see Jara and Kast after today being even more moderate, talking about things that voters care about and trying to compete for the center,” said Rodolfo Disi, a political scientist at Chile’s Adolfo Ibáñez University.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next month, Jara faces the challenge of winning over voters concerned about her lifelong membership in Chile’s Communist party, which supports authoritarian governments in Cuba and Venezuela. Jara came under fire early on in her campaign for referring to Cuba as a democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “We liked her at first, but that moment was when our opinion shifted, it seemed like a really closed-minded view,” Camila Roure, 29, said outside a polling station. But as a woman, Roure said, she wouldn’t vote for Kast — given his history of opposition to divorce and abortion, even in cases of rape.\n \n\n   \n  Although Kast has more recently sought to deflect attention from what he calls traditional family values and his  German-born father’s  Nazi past – which mobilized progressive voters against him during his last two failed presidential bids – he has made clear his views remain the same.\n \n\n   \n  “A Kast government wouldn’t just be a political shift, it would be a huge step backward,” said Macarena Breke, 27, an English teacher voting for Jara.\n \n\n   \n    Jara promises a social safety net\n \n\n   \n  President Boric, the young, tattooed ex-student protest leader who came to power in 2021 vowing to “bury neoliberalism” on the  heels of mass unrest over inequality , has faced criticism from allies and rivals alike that his government failed to fulfill its sweeping promises of social change.\n \n\n   \n  Economic discontent is simmering in one of Latin America’s most prosperous nations, with growth sluggish and unemployment up over 8.5%. The country retains its dictatorship-era constitution after voters rejected a government-backed charter that would have transformed Chile into one of the world’s most progressive societies.\n \n\n   \n  But Boric’s government has several landmark welfare measures to show for itself — many of them thanks to Jara.\n \n\n   \n  As labor minister, she raised the minimum wage, boosted pensions and shortened the workweek to 40 from 45 hours.\n \n\n   \n  “The right is trying to sell this idea that the country is collapsing. But I don’t see that,” said Loreta Sleir, a 27-year-old who voted for Jara.\n \n\n   \n  To address Chile’s cost-of-living crisis — which in 2019 helped fuel the country’s most significant social upheaval since the 1990 fall of Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s bloody dictatorship — Jara proposes a “living” monthly income of around $800 through state subsidies and minimum wage hikes. She promises to invest in big infrastructure projects and new housing.\n \n\n   \n    Kast promises to shrink the state\n \n\n   \n  Kast proposes quite the opposite.\n \n\n   \n  Taking a page from the playbook of President  Javier Milei  in neighboring Argentina, he vows to shrink the public payroll, eliminate government ministries, slash corporate taxes and get rid of regulations.\n \n\n   \n  He says he’ll make a staggering $6 billion in spending cuts over 18 months — a bid which, even if far-fetched, appeals to voters disconcerted by repeated fiscal deficits in a country long hailed as a regional success story for extreme laissez-faire economics.\n \n\n   \n  “The money disappears, the left spends it I don’t know what, human rights, and I can barely afford rent,” said Jorge Ruiz, 48, a cab driver who voted for Kast.\n \n\n   \n  Chile’s 2% deficit this year pales in comparison to the economic woes elsewhere in the region — like in Argentina, where President Trump recently helped halt a currency crisis.\n \n\n   \n   But the repeated deficits are rare for a country long hailed as a regional success story for extreme laissez-faire economics, a model established by Pinochet and sustained for decades after his dictatorship’s downfall.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/epstein-files-petition-growing-gop-support","dateOfPublication":"1006-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-05:00","title":"Trump urges Republicans to vote to release Epstein files, marking stark reversal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has reversed his earlier opposition and urged House Republicans to vote in favor of releasing all files related to Jeffrey Epstein, framing the effort as a response to a 'Democrat Hoax' rather than a demand for transparency.

HudspethBlackburn, Aileen Graef, Kit Maher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:56 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Sunday night encouraged House Republicans to vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files and move on from what he calls a “Democrat Hoax,” marking a  stark reversal  from his efforts to discredit the effort.\n \n\n   \n  “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown,’” Trump posted on  Truth Social .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s reversal comes as expectations of mass GOP defections grew ahead of a House vote this week on an attempt to force the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein case files.\n \n\n   \n   GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California last week  gathered enough signatures  on a discharge petition to force such a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Massie and Khanna appeared optimistic earlier Sunday about their bill’s chances of passing, insisting there was growing support among the GOP in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said he thought 100 or more Republicans in the House could break with Trump, who last week  appealed  to a handful of Republicans who signed on to the Kentucky lawmaker’s discharge petition effort.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we could have a deluge of Republicans. There could be 100 or more. I’m hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote,” Massie said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  reported  last week that GOP leaders were bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from Trump and support the bill.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson previously  called  the effort a “moot point” given an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation, which has released thousands of documents, including from Epstein’s estate. On Sunday, Johnson appeared to preview Trump’s message to House Republicans, telling “Fox News Sunday,” “We’ll just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”\n \n\n   \n  The decision to move quickly with a floor vote, which is expected on Tuesday, came shortly after thousands of  new Epstein emails   were released by the oversight panel last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said late last week that he would  ask the Justice Department  to investigate Epstein’s ties to a slew of high-profile figures linked to the Democratic Party, representing the president’s most significant effort to discredit the push to release all of the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday she would launch the investigation, assigning the US attorney in New York’s Southern District, to lead it. The move raised fears among critics that the president was seeking to use the Justice Department to politicize any investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Massie said earlier Sunday he thought Trump was “trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles” and told his fellow GOP lawmakers that the “record of this vote will last longer” than Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Khanna, who said he’s hoping around 40 Republican lawmakers will vote to release all the Epstein files this week, insisted earlier Sunday that Trump had been “sowing the seeds for his own lame-duck presidency” by going after Republicans who support the release of the files, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s out of touch with his own base,” Khanna said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” before Trump urged Republicans to vote for the bill.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, once a staunch Trump ally, has fallen  out of favor with the president  over her support for the release of files. Trump said Friday that he would no longer support and endorse Greene, who is running for reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Greene, for her part, lamented the fracture, insisting on Sunday that the rift “has all come down to the Epstein files.” She told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that she didn’t understand why the president was fighting the files’ release, as she doesn’t believe he has been implicated in anything illegal.\n \n\n   \n  “That is the question everyone is asking, is, ‘Why fight this so hard?’” Greene said.\n \n\n   \n  While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in the Senate. Majority Leader John Thune previously told CNN he did not think the chamber needs to pass the legislation, citing the Justice Department’s release of thousands of pages related to the case.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Sunday whether he thinks the Senate would take up the effort, Massie said he hopes Thune will “do the right thing,” insisting that “pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/sport/football-nfl-kris-boyd-jets","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00.000-05:00","title":"New York Jets Cornerback Kris Boyd Shot Outside Restaurant, Critical but Stable at Bellevue Hospital","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kris Boyd, a cornerback for the New York Jets, was shot in the stomach outside a restaurant on 38th Street near 7th Avenue in New York City around 2 a.m. on November 16, 2025, after a dispute escalated.

male was in “critical but stable condition” after being transported to the hospital.

White highlighted in the beloved book, in a statement Martha White shared with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Her grandfather “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons,” said White, who is also her grandfather’s literary executor, in the statement. “He didn’t condone fearmongering.”\n \n\n   \n  And even as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, leaned into the “Charlotte’s Web” messaging  Sunday in an X post , Martha White slammed the agency for riding on the book’s coattails with a message antithetical to the story her grandfather told.\n \n\n   \n  “He believed in the rule of law and due process,” Martha White said of her grandfather.\n \n\n   \n  The move into North Carolina comes as agents have arrested thousands across the nation, including dozens in Charlotte, in immigration raids and deported nearly 200,000 people as of late August. The controversy highlights   the tension between the Trump administration efforts to arrest and deport immigrants it deems criminals and the work of civic and community groups highlighting residents’ rights.   \n \n\n   \n  The operation in Charlotte seeks to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,”  according to DHS .\n \n\n   \n  The crackdowns have led to sharp criticism from politicians and community organizations alike.\n \n\n   \n  “In Charlotte, we’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots, and off of our sidewalks,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein   said in a  social media message .\n \n\n   \n  Bovino cited Charlotte’s Web in his X post that gave a nod to agents involved in the operation: “Wherever the wind takes us. High, low. Near, far. East, west. North, south. We take to the breeze, we go as we please.” In the book, that’s when Charlotte’s babies hatch and fly off, leaving Wilbur to cry himself to sleep, only to find out the next morning that three spiders stayed to keep him company.\n \n\n   \n  White highlighted the message of generosity and inclusion that permeates the children’s tale: ‘“By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a little,” Charlotte says in the book. “Heaven knows anyone’s life can stand a little of that.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on Martha White’s statement.\n \n\n   \n    “Operation Charlotte’s Web” kicks off with 81 arrests\n \n\n   \n  Charlotte is the latest city in the Trump adminstration’s crosshairs to face an immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents on Saturday arrested 81 people in the city during a surge of immigration enforcement,  Bovino said Sunday .\n \n\n   \n  The arrests took place during a span of about five hours on Saturday, according to Bovino, who has been tasked with helping lead the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in multiple US cities.\n \n\n   \n  Many of those who were arrested over the weekend “had significant criminal and immigration history, are off the streets,”  Bovino said on X .\n \n\n   \n  Several businesses closed temporarily after the operation was announced, including a popular Colombian bakery that had shuttered its doors only once in the past 28 years.\n \n\n   \n  “I need to protect my customers. I need to protect my people. I need to protect myself and my family,” said Manuel “Manolo” Betancur, who closed his family bakery Saturday after seeing men in green uniforms chase and tackle people outside the shop. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.\n \n\n   \n    Mom criticized use of daughter’s story for “Operation Midway Blitz”\n \n\n   \n   It’s not the first time Trump administration has been criticized for basing the name for an immigration operation on  someone’s story.\n \n\n   \n  The mother of the woman who became the face of Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago said  last month  her daughter would not have wanted to be associated with the crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security  said  it launched the enforcement push in honor of Katie Abraham, an Illinois woman who authorities say was killed in a drunken-driving hit-and-run crash by a man who was in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Denise Lorence, decided to speak out after realizing the operation’s association with her daughter wasn’t going away, she wrote in an  op-ed for the Chicago Tribune .\n \n\n   \n  “Losing a child unlocked a pain I never knew existed. Losing a child to a crime adds to the depths of despair,” she wrote. “Having my child’s legacy be associated with a politically charged and controversial operation instead of the positivity and light she contributed to those within her community is simply unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  Her daughter would not want to be associated with the immigration crackdown in a city she loved and felt safe in, Lorence wrote in the op-ed titled “My daughter is the face of Operation Midway Blitz. I am reclaiming her legacy.”\n \n\n   \n  She said Abraham wasn’t political, she avoided confrontation and “was the person people wanted to be around,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Lorence acknowledged that Abraham’s father, Joe Abraham, and his wife agreed that Katie’s name could be used for the operation. Joe Abraham previously  told CNN  the federal government failed to”miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”\n \n\n   \n  “Whether or not you agree with Operation Midway Blitz is not the story I am here to write,” Lorence wrote, but “she did not choose to be thrust into this political spotlight to advance an operation she knew nothing about.”\n \n\n   \n  Martha White also emphasized the distance between her grandfather’s work and those trying to appropriate it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to know when to speak up,” she said in her statement, “to expose the lies or misperceptions (the rule of law still applies in Sanctuary Cities, by the way), and when to deny the limelight that feeds the cruelty.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/americas/lecuadors-los-lobos-drug-trafficking-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00-05:00","title":"Alleged leader of Ecuadorian drug trafficking gang Los Lobos arrested in Spain","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wilmer Geovanny Chavarría Barré, known as 'Pipo,' the alleged leader of Ecuador’s most powerful and violent drug trafficking gang Los Lobos, has been arrested in Spain.

Late Samsung billionaire Lee Kun-hee’s vast art collection \n       \n  By Christy Choi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:48 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For more than seven decades, the family behind electronics giant Samsung amassed one of Asia’s largest private art collections. Now, with thousands of its priceless works in public hands following the death of the conglomerate’s chairman, the collection is being put to new use — as part of South Korea’s “ K-culture ” soft-power drive.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 of the 23,000 objects  gifted to the country  in 2021 by the late Lee Kun-hee’s estate — thought to be part of a deal to settle an inheritance tax bill of over 12 trillion won ($8.2 billion) — are going on display at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC this month.\n \n\n   \n  Spanning 1,500 years, the items selected by the Smithsonian’s curators for “ Korean Treasures: Collected, Cherished, Shared ” give visitors a glimpse of the roots and evolution of Korea’s modern identity, as well as the motivations of the notoriously private Lee family.\n \n\n   \n  The objects range from rare Buddhist sculptures and sacred texts to antique furniture and 20th-century paintings by pioneering artists like Lee Ungno and Kim Whanki, who curators say redefined Korean painting in a modernizing world.\n \n\n   \n  The Lee Kun-hee collection, which was started by its namesake’s father, Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, is unprecedented in its scope and scale. Almost all the 23,000 donated items went to the National Museum of Korea and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, whose curators collaborated with the Smithsonian for this exhibition. After the gift was announced, South Korea’s government unveiled plans for an entire  new museum  in Seoul to display the collection, which it hopes will “strengthen Korea’s brand identity as a cultural powerhouse.”\n \n\n   \n  The Washington, DC exhibition includes several sections dedicated to Korea’s last royal kingdom, the Joseon dynasty, which lasted from 1392 to 1910. Curators showcase the tastes and morals of the scholarly elite through court art and ceremonial objects, offering a look at the ideals, aesthetics and patronage systems that shaped Korean culture. The show also considers Buddhism and its legacy on the Korean peninsula, as well as modern artists’ attempts to grapple with the  Korean War  and monumental changes happening in the country and globally.\n \n\n   \n    An identity formed\n \n\n   \n  Some items from the Washington, DC exhibition will also be displayed in Chicago and London next year amid growing global fascination with all things Korean, from  K-beauty  to K-pop.\n \n\n   \n  “It is fantastic that Korea is making this global contribution to popular culture the way it is, but you know, Korean culture didn’t start 10 or 15 years ago, right?” said Chase F. Robinson, director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art, over a video call. “There are deep, deep reservoirs or veins of, especially, Korean visual culture. This is an opportunity to see that in play.”\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition, Robinson added, will “play an important role in filling out that understanding, and (in) seeing some of those pre-modern traditions that feed into these millennia of creative dynamics.”\n \n\n   \n  The theme is particularly relevant given the growing size, influence and cultural power of Asian American communities in the United States, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the objects are being exhibited outside of Korea for the first time, organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  “That there is this heritage that is so multi-dimensional and so rich — to bring it all together and show the significance — I think is what is notable, remarkable,” said Carol Huh, the museum’s associate curator of contemporary Asian art, over a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Huh’s interest and specialty is the work of 20th- and 21st-century artists who addressed modernization and a rapidly changing political landscape. It is a period in which Korea, having had very little contact with the wider world for centuries, suddenly found itself being influenced by forces and trends far beyond its immediate neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  Within 100 years, the country went from being an imperial dynasty to a Japanese colony, to two independent states after the peninsula was divided into a Russian-controlled north and US-administered south after World War II. South Korea is now a liberal democracy, while the North is a totalitarian state run by Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  “They were very much at the core of this complicated history of trying to understand what it is to be an artist in Korea,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Huh said the Lees’ bequest fills a gap in the history of contemporary Korean art with work by nearly 300 20th-century artists included. It was, she added, a period of identifying and asserting distinctly Korean cultural forms.\n \n\n   \n  Among the Smithsonian’s selection is work by artists like Kim Whanki, a well-known figure in the monochrome Dansaekhwa movement, whose members — having lived through Korea’s liberation from Japan, a civil war and the military dictatorship — used abstraction to avoid explicit meaning in their images, partly out of fear of strict government censorship. Also featured is Lee Ungno and Park Saengkwang, part of the antithetical Minjung art (or “the people’s” art) movement, which sought to advance democracy and social justice in the 1970s and 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  The Lee family “presciently sought out modern paintings at a time when only a few paid attention to them,” reads the exhibition catalog.\n \n\n   \n    A legacy collected\n \n\n   \n  Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul was partly motivated by the desire to repatriate art from Korean history. Many of the artifacts he acquired had, over the centuries, been sent abroad, lost or actively erased by the colonial Japanese government, which had even sought to outlaw the Korean language.\n \n\n   \n  “The cultural heritage of our nation should no longer be scattered or lost abroad,” he wrote in his autobiography.\n \n\n   \n  The Lees have made various gifts to museums across South Korea in recent decades. And even after its vast 2021 donation, the family retains a sizeable private collection, some of which is on display at the Samsung-run Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, where the family continues its collecting legacy.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee’s art acquisitions were not without controversy: In 2007, he was accused by Kim Yong-chul, a former Samsung lawyer, of buying expensive artworks using company slush funds. That accusation, which Lee denied, set off an investigation into the former chairman that saw him convicted of tax evasion in 2008 (though prosecutors never brought bribery charges relating to the alleged slush funds).\n \n\n   \n  Like some of the artists in its collection, the Lee family also appeared to grapple with what it means to be Korean in a globalized era, and the collection gives glimpses into what the Lees, and their advisors, saw as part of Korean identity — and what they sought to project to the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Lee Kun-hee is quoted in the exhibition catalog as saying: “When Korean identity permeates our daily lives, we will gain cultural competitiveness on the world stage.”\n \n\n   \n  His father, meanwhile, was known to write about how artworks excited him when he needed a spiritual lift, or would calm him down when he was excited or upset, said J. Keith Wilson, the Smithsonian’s curator of ancient Chinese art.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, he had a very personal connection with Korean art of the past and was able to communicate with it in what seems to be like a spiritual way,” Wilson added.\n \n\n   \n   “ Korean Treasures: Collected, Cherished, Shared ” is showing at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC through February 1, 2026.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-interview-apologizes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"09:39:00-05:00","title":"‘Humbly, I’m sorry’: Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s turning a new leaf after years of divisive comments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican U.S. Representative from Georgia, has publicly apologized for her long-standing use of toxic political rhetoric, including Holocaust comparisons and personal attacks on political opponents.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said Sunday she will stop using “toxic” rhetoric, marking what would be a dramatic shift in a political brand hallmarked by derogatory comments.\n \n\n   \n  The commitment comes amid a rift with Donald Trump that has spilled into  public view , with the president attacking the Georgia Republican personally. Greene, meanwhile, has pivoted away from the Republican Party more broadly recently, criticizing the GOP on a number of fronts, including the party’s handling of the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, Greene said she worried Trump’s rhetoric toward her could lead to violence against her.\n \n\n   \n  “The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong,” Greene said, “and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.”\n \n\n   \n  When pressed by Bash on why she didn’t speak out against Trump using such rhetoric until it was directed at her, Greene conceded that it was “fair criticism.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to say, humbly, I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it’s very bad for our country,” Greene said. “It’s been something I’ve thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene said she realized that she has participated in or supported heated rhetoric that has resulted in threats toward others, a point of reflection for her.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.”\n \n\n   \n    A long history of flagrant remarks\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s pivot represents a sharp departure from her typical conservative firebrand persona. She has previously spread offensive rhetoric about the Holocaust, lobbed personal insults during congressional proceedings and fought with fellow Republicans to the point her own caucus has pushed for  repercussions  for her acting out.\n \n\n   \n  Greene repeatedly indicated support for Facebook posts calling for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019, before she was elected to Congress, a CNN KFile  report revealed  in 2021. After CNN reached out to Greene at the time, her personal Twitter account posted a statement that did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments, but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. The report  resulted in  her being removed from House committee assignments  until 2023 .\n \n\n   \n  Also in 2021,  Greene compared  then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to continue to require House lawmakers to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Greene  issued  a rare apology after that incident.\n \n\n   \n  She  was also ejected  from the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2023 in part because of fights she had with its members. She later brushed off her ouster, saying she didn’t “have time for the drama club.”\n \n\n   \n  In one of her more notorious incidents, Greene got into a fight during a committee markup in 2024, during which  she insulted   Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s personal appearance and verbally sparred with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n \n\n   \n  Greene refused to apologize when given the opportunity by the committee’s chair. The majority of Republicans on the panel eventually voted to allow Greene to continue speaking during the markup, though Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado joined Democrats in voting to have Greene silenced for the rest of the period.\n \n\n   \n  That was not the only time Boebert and Greene had a public disagreement. During an argument on the House floor in 2023, Greene  called Boebert  “a little b*tch.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond her colleagues, Greene also  snapped  at a British journalist to “go back to your country” after the reporter asked about the Signal chat controversy involving Trump administration officials earlier this year\n \n\n   \n  Greene said Sunday she’s done participating in politics in that way, adding that America needs to find “a new path forward,” and calling on people “to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/trump-sued-over-plans-to-paint-eisenhower-building-in-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Preservationists Sue Over Trump’s Latest Plans to Refashion a Federal Building to Match His Aesthetic","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preservationists, including the DC Preservation League and Cultural Heritage Partners, have filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, demanding that any changes to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building—particularly plans to paint it white—be reviewed through mandated federal environmental and historic preservation processes.

He has also touted plans to  install a triumphal arch  to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding.\n \n\n   \n  The suit argues the Trump administration cannot move forward with the president’s plans without going through “the environmental and historic preservation review that federal law requires.”\n \n\n   \n  Going around those reviews could result in irreversible damage, the groups argue. Painting stone “can trap moisture within the wall system” and accelerate deterioration, the suit says. It adds that if the building was painted, “removing paint from the natural granite and slate would require immense expense” and potentially result in the loss of the original material.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed plans of a white Eisenhower building “looked like a giant marshmallow,” said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, the law firm that filed the suit.\n \n\n   \n  “But our complaint isn’t about the president’s taste,” Werkheiser said. “You can have really bad taste. You can have really good taste. What we’re asking for is you comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Completed in 1888, the Eisenhower building originally housed the State, War and Navy departments, but now serves as ancillary office space for the president’s staff, including the Office of the Vice President, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. The building’s interior includes 553 ornately gilded rooms, bronze stair balusters, hand-painted tiles, carved wooden fixtures, stained glass rotundas and intricate cast iron.\n \n\n   \n  But the building’s unique French Second Empire style has been controversial since its inception. It took roughly 17 years to build, and by the time it was done, “the Second Empire style had fallen from favor, and (architect Alfred) Mullett’s masterpiece was perceived by capricious Victorians as only an embarrassing reminder of past whims in architectural preference,”  according to  the Biden White House.\n \n\n   \n  Guides leading tourists around the White House complex are often heard quoting from the author Mark Twain, who reportedly described it as “the ugliest building in America.”\n \n\n   \n  And President Harry Truman called it a “monstrosity.”\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s firm will ask for a preliminary injunction Monday on an emergency basis — but it will also ask the judge to issue a restraining order to prevent Trump from ordering alterations to the building until the court evaluates the case.\n \n\n   \n  Werkheiser’s team will seek to make the case that the Constitution “says the president is obligated to take care, to follow the laws,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “After the East Wing debacle, no reasonable person could say, ‘Well the president wasn’t on notice that these laws apply or that he needed to take additional care,’” he said. “The extensiveness of the outrage of that incident eliminates any excuse he has to pretend he can go quickly and avoid this process.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/faa-ends-shutdown-flight-cuts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"08:49:00.000-05:00","title":"FAA ends emergency order mandating flight reductions at 40 airports during government shutdown, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has terminated an emergency flight reduction order that had been in effect since November 7, 2025, at 40 major airports, due to staffing shortages caused by a prolonged government shutdown.

China warns citizens against Japan travel as Taiwan spat escalates \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:16 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has warned its citizens against traveling to Japan as it escalates a backlash over comments by the country’s prime minister about the island of Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  The dictum is Beijing’s most substantive retaliation yet to Sanae Takaichi’s remarks. Even as it may be more symbolic than anything, the move suggests Beijing is willing to wield its economic heft to press geopolitical points, a well-worn playbook.\n \n\n   \n  Recent “blatantly provocative remarks on Taiwan” have “further damaged the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges… creating additional risks to the safety and security of Chinese citizens in Japan,” a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry and its missions “remind Chinese citizens to refrain from visiting Japan for the time being,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Following the announcement, a number of Chinese airlines including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern on Saturday published notices on their websites offering customers refunds or free changes on certain tickets to Japan, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Education also  advised its citizens  to exercise caution when making plans to study in Japan, citing a “worsening public security situation” in the country and claiming there had been a “surge in crimes targeting Chinese nationals.”\n \n\n   \n  The moves by Beijing are its latest displays of outrage in a  roughly week-long row  after Takaichi, in response to a question in Japan’s parliament, said that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would count as “a situation threatening Japan’s survival,” and thus could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan’s sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed.\n \n\n   \n  China’s Ministry of Defense on Friday separately warned that Japan would “suffer a crushing defeat” if it dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s travel warning was mirrored on Saturday by authorities in the financial hub Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, with residents there  urged  to exercise caution in visiting Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\n \n\n   \n  The travel advisory follows official protest from both sides related to the incident – with each country summoning the other’s ambassador – and a surge of vitriolic backlash against Takaichi from within China, where nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment has been on the rise in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The falling-out comes less than two weeks after Takaichi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time on the sidelines of an international summit and agreed to pursue constructive, stable ties.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A heavy price’\n \n\n   \n  The backlash was kicked off by China’s Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian, who last Saturday shared a news article about Takaichi’s remarks and commented “the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,” in a post on X that has since been deleted.\n \n\n   \n  State media has since published a barrage of scathing commentaries and editorials, while rampant social media discussion has disparaged Takaichi, Japan’s first woman prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  A commentary from the People’s Liberation Army Daily published Saturday attacked Takaichi and said if Japan intervened militarily in the Taiwan Strait, China would give it a “head-on blow.” A PLA-affiliated X account also circulated comments translated into Japanese warning Japan would “pay a heavy price” in such a case.\n \n\n   \n  Tokyo on Friday summoned China’s ambassador to Japan to protest Xue’s “highly inappropriate remarks” and demand Beijing take “appropriate actions,” its foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing had a day prior summoned Japan’s ambassador to China, in a meeting where Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong said Takaichi’s comments had “seriously damaged the political foundation of China-Japan relations,” and slammed Japan for not retracting them.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday said there was no need to retract Takaichi’s comments, stressing that they were made within the context of a discussion on an “existential crisis situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Separately on Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important not only for Japan’s security but also for the stability of the international community.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Takaichi said her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would refrain from making similar comments in parliament again.\n \n\n   \n  Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response. And Washington deliberately remains vague on how it would respond to a hypothetical invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing, which is widely seen as aiming to establish itself as the dominant power in the region, looks warily at the American alliance with Japan when it comes to its own regional security and ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has called for closer security ties with the US and last month moved to accelerate the country’s defense build-up, but like previous Japanese prime ministers she must balance the country’s close economic ties to China.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596403","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:12.123+08:00","title":"Military Actions in the Region: Assessing the Impact on Regional Stability and International Relations","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and its allies have launched a series of military operations in a specific region to support regional stability and counter terrorist threats.

Indeed, the prized pony of ADOR, a sub-label of the juggernaut K-pop company HYBE, had spent the previous year affirming itself as an exciting next step in the genre's evolution.  Billboard  felt like the perfect American institution to recognize this leap: The 2023 EP  Get Up  had made NewJeans only the second K-pop girl group to top the  Billboard  200, after  Blackpink . But as the group  performed \"Super Shy\" and \"ETA,\"   Get Up 's hits, the distance between the two units couldn't have been more apparent. Blackpink was the final benchmark of an old K-pop model; NewJeans was a brand new one. For one thing, there was a profound understatement to the NewJeans performance — members gliding in and out of the lead spot with uncanny precision, distinct from the flamboyant mini-showcases that had come before. The sparkling fits, flowy choreo and muted music were impressive on their own, but the rush was in how seamlessly they worked together, telling a story about style. Where many K-pop groups spend their press runs trying to be all things to all listeners, NewJeans had spent its breakout year building an aesthetic niche to live in. Where some K-pop singles are so obsessed with  now- ness that they feel out of time the moment they're born, NewJeans' songs seemed to be angling for something timeless. For a moment, it looked as if the group could be K-pop's future — if not a bellwether then at least a new barometer, and a message to the industry to reconsider how it does business. Yet only a month after the  Billboard  ceremony, that horizon became clouded in uncertainty: A power struggle erupted within HYBE for control of NewJeans' future, benching the group for over a year and dividing its fanbase. A  surprise announcement  this month promises that NewJeans will be back, but the long absence leading to this unsteady return has felt, to those paying attention to the genre's scandals over the years, like the latest evidence of a lingering rot. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even many superfans will tell you that K-pop's pageantry has often masked a troubled business model, where impressionable young trainees commit to a life run entirely by their agencies. Signing on the dotted line can come with  extraordinary expectations : plastic surgery, disordered eating, heavy restrictions on socializing. South Korea's Fair Trade Commission finally capped K-pop contracts at seven years after a 2009 controversy around the boy band TVXQ, who coined the term \"slave contract\" to describe its own 13-year agreement. K-pop was also at ground zero for the rise of toxic stan culture, from  the doxxing of journalists  to the cyberbullying of artists; one such star, Sulli of the girl group f(x), died by suicide in the midst of unrelenting harassment. Concerns over these practices have been a public talking point for years, but reform efforts rarely stick: In 2019, Yang Hyun-suk, co-founder of YG Entertainment, was forced to step down from the label after threatening a whistleblower to cover up a drug allegation facing one of his artists; he has since returned to YG and is helming the girl group Babymonster. The industry famous for its finely honed artist development method, sometimes called the \"K-pop formula,\" has always lived with this tension: a creative philosophy with proven results, and a near-constant struggle for fairer relations between performers and the adults who oversee them. The latest and most public installment in this fight began last spring, with an outlier act suddenly at the center of the story. In April 2024, NewJeans found itself caught in a quarrel between two corporate masters. On one side stood the top brass at HYBE, the largest of the country's \" big four \" entertainment agencies since it went public in 2020. On the other was one of their deputies: Min Hee-jin, CEO and founder of ADOR, who had launched NewJeans in 2022 and served as a creative director for its music. An industry veteran by the time she joined HYBE in 2019, Min had arrived touting progressive ideas for managing talent, already positioning her next group as an alternative to K-pop's star system. HYBE had given her the keys, but now alleged that an internal audit revealed she sought to seize total control of ADOR — and took steps to fire her. Min denied such a thing was possible, and claimed the falling-out actually stemmed from her complaints that the company had sidelined NewJeans, stifling its growth in favor of other girl groups it was launching. That August, ADOR announced Min had stepped down as CEO, while the producer insisted she had been forced out. When asked, in  an interview  with the English-language newspaper  Korea JoongAng Daily , why she and NewJeans were so committed to working together, Min attributed the closeness to her unique style of artist development, saying: “I have had many thoughts and concerns after nearly 20 years in the entertainment industry. I felt it was crucial to change the rigid dynamic between producers and artists. I was concerned about how to guide young artists in a way that benefits their lives and the industry as a whole. In that context, NewJeans is like a child that comes from my heart and mind. Beyond my personal desire to support them, I aim to establish a new kind of relationship within a business model as a producer. That’s why I’m committed to this challenge and refuse to back down easily.” Throughout the ordeal, the five members of NewJeans — Minji (now 21), Hanni (21), Danielle (20), Haerin (19) and Hyein (17) — publicly supported Min and called for her reinstatement, saying they would not continue without her. HYBE suggested a compromise: Min could stay on, but in a limited role as a music producer, an offer Min quickly denounced as a mockery of her mission. \"It is contradictory to accuse me of breach of trust while offering me a producer role. I chose to join because HYBE claimed they wanted to create a new wave and flow in K-pop. If those aspects hadn't been guaranteed, I wouldn't have even joined the company,\" she said in an interview with Japan's TV Asahi/ANN News program  News Station . The only tenable way forward, she argued, was for her to continue as CEO, managing business and production in tandem. By then, the issue had grown bigger than Min, with the NewJeans girls voicing their own criticisms of the parent company. Last September, in  an impromptu YouTube livestream  that played like a hostage video, the members called HYBE inhumane, detailing mistreatment and harassment. A month later, Hanni testified, through tears, before the South Korean National Assembly's Environment and Labor Committee, as a reference witness for an audit being conducted around workplace harassment and artist protection in the entertainment industry. She spoke about discrimination she and her groupmates faced at HYBE, and the resulting distrust. The case was ultimately dismissed, with the committee ruling that members of K-pop groups are not workers, and therefore are not entitled to labor protections. Finally, on Nov. 28, 2024, NewJeans took matters into its own hands. At a press conference, the members announced the termination of their exclusive contract with ADOR, and vowed to seek the right to continue independently under the NewJeans name. The industry moved swiftly against them, with the Korea Management Federation and Korea Entertainment Producers' Association both siding with the company, the latter calling the act  childish . Attempts to freelance under a new name,  NJZ , were quickly thwarted. The group performed for the last time in February 2025, headlining at ComplexCon Hong Kong. It took a year of legal limbo, with the group's musical activities stopped cold, before a pair of decisions put an end to the suspense. On Oct. 30, 2025, Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of ADOR, saying that NewJeans must honor its contract and stay with the label through 2029. The members initially stuck to their guns, saying in a statement, \"It is impossible to return to ADOR and continue normal entertainment activities under the current situation where the trust relationship with ADOR has completely broken down.\" They vowed to appeal the ruling, a case legal experts estimated would not be heard until well into 2026. Then came a twist that few saw coming: On Nov. 12, ADOR announced in a press release that the group's two youngest members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the label, with no word on Minji, Danielle and Hanni. A few hours later, the three holdouts announced their intention to return as well — but  through a news article , saying they had contacted ADOR but had not yet heard back. The label's response was a reluctant one: \"We are confirming the authenticity of their intentions.\" That abrupt, staggered homecoming may be the perfect distillation of the conflicting ideologies that have swirled around the group from all sides.  Local reports claimed  that Hyein's father — who had so strongly opposed their leaving the label that he entered a civil dispute with his wife over legal guardianship, citing a need for an \"environment where Hyein could focus on her career\" — was instrumental in bringing the younger girls back to ADOR. In contrast,  The Korea Herald  reported that Minji's mother had been a vocal supporter of Min and her position in the fight with HYBE. Meanwhile, Min herelf had moved on, announcing the start of her own indie agency just ahead of the court verdict. But she did release a statement giving her blessing for the group's return to ADOR, with the parting wish that they remain united. \"I can begin anew anywhere. But I believe that NewJeans must remain whole as five,\" Min said. \"I hope the members grow stronger and become an even better NewJeans, and above all, I wish happiness for all five members.\" The end of Min's label experiment points to something bigger at play, a tug-of-war that has long felt inescapable within K-pop. During the peak of the dispute, HYBE and the courts asserted there would be no disruption to the NewJeans operation under the proposed changes. But Min had intentionally designed ADOR, a boutique imprint with NewJeans as its only artist, to run counter to the HYBE system, binding artists' and producers' fates together in ways frankly radical for the genre. \"I wanted to have all of these come together,\" Min  told  Fast Company , describing the balance of art and commerce that made up her fantasy K-pop outfit. \"My definition of cool music, with my definition of a cool picture, with my definition of a great business. Business is, of course, important because if you don't make money with art, it would be kind of useless.\" Before launching ADOR, Min was one of the defining figures in K-pop aesthetics. As the creative director at SM Entertainment, she styled and designed concepts for Girls' Generation, SHINee, EXO, f(x) and Red Velvet, becoming the highest-paid woman in the industry in the process. \"I accomplished a lot of things when I was at SM, and I left because I was not really satisfied with my life there,\" she told  Fast Company . \"But I'm not saying that I came here because I love this company; I needed a place where I could actualize my vision.\" The ADOR way — which is to say, the NewJeans blueprint — was to defy what Min called \"conventional K-pop idol grammar\" and create a group for non-fanatics: a smooth, iterative sound that never resolves, snappy enough to generate earworms yet compact enough to not overstay its welcome. \"For most K-pop songs, there's always an intro and then the climax and the tension relieves again, because people think that having loops is boring,\" Min said in that interview. She was specifically referencing NewJeans' club-pop confection \" Super Shy ,\" which artfully defies this climax-release principle by converting liquid drum and bass into blissful Powerpuff pizzazz. The song was co-written and -arranged by the Danish singer-songwriter  Erika de Casier , and is imbued with her soft-focused, nostalgic take on Y2K-era R&B. In it, you can hear the NewJeans model at full bore: loopy, sugar-rush songcraft accented by airbrushed vocals. But most important is its holism: It is streamlined, even graceful, where many other K-pop recordings feel like Megazord constructions of the myriad artists who work on them. (EXO-K's \" History ,\" for example, has two different bridges, one of which feels beamed in from a completely different song.) The fragmented approach can be its own kind of endearing, but stitching together bits of tracks was not Min's way. \"There is a reason why we have composers make the songs! Sometimes, we'll adjust the top line, but we never go as far as to damage the real intention of the song,\" she said. Min's production MO was pointed defiantly away from the tried and true way of doing things, which took some collaborators by surprise. \"One of the first questions they asked me was, 'Do you listen a lot to K-pop?' \" de Casier  told  GQ  in 2023. \"And I got so nervous and I had to be honest and said, 'No, I haven't yet explored that genre.' And they're like, 'Good, because we want something new. We want something fresh.' \" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       K-pop can often sound oddly anachronistic, even when aiming at an explicitly retro sound, but NewJeans spun a mirage of the past into a modern teenage dream. The touchstones weren't unique ('90s streetwear, early aughts American prep, teen dramas), nor were the genres at play (new jack swing, synth-pop, Jersey and Baltimore club, Miami bass, throwback R&B); it was the ways in which they were remixed, the sense of curation and harmony at work and the way it all slotted neatly into a TikTok-induced optimization. A lot has been made of NewJeans' minimalism as a refreshing counter to K-pop maximalism, but the real innovation was its sepia-toned feel: K-pop as a moodboard come alive, revitalizing the old to the point of a full revolution. Some portion of that has to be attributed to the impresario-auteur at the reins and her master plan. \"These days people use the word producer kind of interchangeably as a composer. I'm a producer, but I don't make songs,\" Min said. \"I plan strategies.\" It is only through such acumen that you get the synergy of a dot-com-era obsessive like de Casier calibrating the group's filter for maximum effect. She is far from the first inspired pairing of choice Westerner and ascendant K-pop group — the late  SOPHIE  produced for ITZY;  Carly Rae Jepsen  co-wrote an f(x) song;  Troye Sivan  and  Charli XCX  worked on music for the giants  BTS  and  TWICE , respectively — but in many of those songs you can often feel the discord of trying to force those artists to adapt to the agencies' market-tested structure. So much of the NewJeans synthesis came from those brought onto the creative team having no clue how K-pop usually works. \"It's hard [for me] to say how their music differs from other K‑pop songs — I think it's better for music critics to comment on that,\" Ylva Dimberg, one of the group's recurring writers and producers, told  The Face . The primary NewJeans producer, 250, put forth a theory of K-pop music that seemed to align with the group's mandate: He asked a Swedish friend who headed a K-pop songwriting team what K-pop was, because he didn't really know, and the friend said it could be anything. \"People talk about 'the formula of K-pop.' But I don't really understand that, because K-pop is really just pop music made by Koreans,\"  he told  Nylon . \"So whatever we do, we don't need to follow any specific rules because no one can tell us something we made isn't K-pop.\" Not following rules seems to be precisely the strategy Min envisioned. To 250's point, the idea of a genre as omnivorous as K-pop having a central sound is ridiculous, but a unique song framework can still stand out. Most NewJeans songs don't have bridges; none have obligatory rap verses. All feel like they have been stripped to their essential parts, stringing hooks together like embroidery floss along a friendship bracelet, and all have a perfect grasp on the balance between Western and Eastern pop sensibilities. Much of that equilibrium seems to begin with the sessions themselves and the collaborators put in the room: a marriage between outsiders from the Korean industry and niche Scandinavian artists, adding up to an unfussy fusionist's phantasmagoria. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       It should be said: While ADOR's anti-system stance paid off handsomely as a creative ethic, it proved less effective in remaking the industry at the administrative level. Min was never a K-pop socialist — revolutionary by industry standards, certainly, but still longed to be a CEO fronting a business — and in time she inevitably found herself playing by the house rules, subject to the same industry politicking as other K-pop executives. (Among the evidence cited in October's court ruling were unearthed Slack messages from Min ordering subordinates to dig up dirt on other HYBE artists, which the court saw as grounds to declare breach of trust, misuse of personal information, infringement of trade secrets, defamation and abuse of power.) No one person could overhaul the entire enterprise, but Min's undoing feels like an especially revealing lesson in the limits of the master's tools. K-pop is a copycat league. Not just in the musical sense — as when Girls' Generation ripped Duffy's \"Mercy\" for its own \" Dancing Queen ,\" or when myriad K-pop groups followed the success of \"Despacito\" down the reggaeton rabbit hole — but also in its efforts to recreate the tactics of anything that brings in audiences (hence \"the K-pop formula,\" which is about replicating the paces of idol assembly down to the members' roles). The space vacated by NewJeans has been tough to fill, but that doesn't mean there haven't been one-off attempts to take a few laps in its lane. In Illit, a HYBE sister group whom Min accused of ripping off NewJeans wholesale, you can hear the same collage-like principle on songs like \" Magnetic \" and \" jellyous .\" Olivia Marsh, the literal sister of NewJeans' Danielle, tunes her \" Strategy \" to a similar turn-of-the-millenium frequency. Several songs, from ifeye's \" IRL \" and HITGS' \" SOURPATCH \" to VIVIZ's \" Full Moon \" and izna's \" BEEP ,\" have tried to recreate the bubblegum bass vibe of skipping rhythms and lush, light vocals; even TWICE  got in  on the fun last year. Others, like Hearts2Hearts' \" Blue Moon \" and RESCENE's \" Deja Vu ,\" conjure the dreamy, rosy-eyed R&B-lite. All of these attempts are serviceable; many are even pleasant. But none quite recreate the mojo. The contrast is, at least partly, in the roadmap. Min made an organizational practice of stockpiling good, complete songs and figuring out what to do with them later, whereas the traditional K-pop process involves building an elaborate concept around a plug-and-play single and treating it as a peg for months of extended rollout activities. NewJeans didn't do isolated campaigns or tossed-off B-sides; everything served the broader group architecture, something not to be taken for granted in K-pop's LARPing ecosystem, where artists transform between promo cycles. (Just look at the jarring transition from LE SSERAFIM's posed, subtle, disco-inflected \" Hot \" to the campy, lurid, rap-forward \" Spaghetti .\") Min once said that the music itself was the concept with NewJeans, and simple as that seems, it's a key part of the group's appeal: There was an identifiable and qualifiable NewJeans sound, one that was singular and exclusive. It was clear what a New Jeans song was, and — just as crucially — what it wasn't, to the point of feeling intuitive. The group did all of the things inherent to K-pop groups, but it did so with a sense of taste top of mind. The worst K-pop can feel like bad product placement: odious in its lack of subtlety, putting the commerce front and center and pretending otherwise, treating its \"idols\" like collectible dolls to generate shareholder value. It would be disingenuous to suggest that NewJeans was in any way immune to the genre's hazards of  investment opportunity  or marketing front —  the video for \"ETA\"  is an ad for the iPhone 14 Pro — but the group's promotion was far less gauche; it was purposeful, even, and shrewd in its movements. It was the influencer ideal: the mere presence doing much of the selling, of a vibe more than a commodity. There was a naturalness, at odds with the usual K-pop posturing, and the styling and choreography were in complete alignment with the music, which was clearly the main attraction. That is, perhaps, why this battle feels particularly distressing in an industry that is no stranger to scandal and corporate malpractice. It is disorienting for K-pop's most actualized act to become the face of its dysfunction. It's impossible to say whether this is the beginning of the end for NewJeans. Perhaps, years from now, Min Hee-jin's dismissal will feel like the official death knell — or maybe it will be a blip in an otherwise successful career at ADOR. But it's also tempting to think of the what-ifs — the artistic and workplace breakthroughs that could have been made at the key turning points of this saga. What might the NewJeans arc have been had it continued uninterrupted, and could it have ushered in a new K-pop paradigm, or at least an alternative to the norm? What might the business look like had the Environment and Labor Committee heard Hanni's testimony as an elegy, a plea to bury the old ways?  Min once mused , \"It can be scary to suggest something different. But once the suggestion is accepted, I think that's what writes new history.\" Before us now is the other side of that coin: the suggestion rejected, the door closed on renewal, and a group once defined by its counterculture ethos headed back to the assembly line, to resume performing as though nothing has changed. K-pop is reliant on a blissful suspension of disbelief, the stage as a whimsical little pocket world — but it's hard to imagine the many layers of strained relationships here won't taint the NewJeans fantasy in ways that cannot be ignored. In a  recent interview  with the Associated Press, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man — Min's former boss and a key player in K-pop's global expansion — was asked his thoughts on the genre's darker controversies, from which his own company had scarcely been immune. (Recall TVXQ's \"slave contract\" controversy and Sulli's suicide — both SM artists.) Lee responded with another question: \"Should we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\" he asked. \"Media should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn't we talk more about the future?\" I've been thinking about that a lot since I read it. It's a question premised on the idea that the past and future are partitioned from each other, and that the darkness is all in the rearview mirror. Yet if the NewJeans gauntlet is any indication, those tribulations are still far closer to us than they appear. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611438","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"After months of infighting, House GOP could vote today to release the Epstein files","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After months of internal conflict within the Republican Party, the U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on a bipartisan measure to compel the Justice Department to release all files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.

Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Republicans in the House could be on track today to approve the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a vote that follows President Trump's unexpected blessing for a measure that has driven rancor through the party and its base. The bipartisan effort, which has been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.,  about her support for releasing the files , but her position was unchanged after the meeting. Trump has also attacked Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga. However, Trump did an about face over the weekend as it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, and said Republicans  should approve the bill . On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. The measure, if passed, would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on the convicted sex offender within 30 days. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success.  Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the vote.  His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition – a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became  the decisive 218th signature on the petition . Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to  put off the vote . Johnson rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved. He also committed to not block the vote on the House floor. Tuesday's expected vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released  a set of three emails , followed by  thousands of pages of new files  released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019. Ahead of the vote, Massie and Khanna plan to gather with survivors and their families and friends. They last appeared together in September on Capitol Hill  to lobby for the release of the Epstein files , saying transparency was the path to holding those involved fully accountable. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Survivors reiterated that position in a Friday letter to Congress in which they urged the release of files relating to Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving time at a Texas facility after her conviction on trafficking charges. \"Epstein and Maxwell's crimes exposed a double standard of justice, where rich and powerful men and women evade repercussions,\" they wrote. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611107","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"The Epstein Files Are Just the Latest Fracture Hitting Trump's MAGA Coalition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the growing ideological rift within the MAGA coalition, centered on the public dispute between Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and President Donald Trump over the release of Justice Department files on Jeffrey Epstein.

the latest fracture hitting Trump's MAGA coalition \n         By Stephen Fowler, Saige Miller \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         To the casual observer, President Trump's withdrawal of his political endorsement of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a \"traitor\" after she questioned his opposition to releasing Justice Department files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, may have come as a surprise. He did  reverse course  Sunday night, calling on the House to pass a measure to release the files \"because we have nothing to hide.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After joining the House in 2021, she has also recently apologized for \"toxic politics,\" warned  Trump's attacks  have jeopardized her family's safety and reiterated her support for Trump's presidency. Still, the public fight over the Epstein files is the culmination of months of criticism from some conservatives toward Trump's policy agenda, as cracks in the MAGA coalition begin to show. Other splits with Trump Since Trump returned to office in January, there have been several moments in the background – and sometimes foreground – where some on the right say the president hasn't delivered on domestic priorities that \"Make America Great Again\" like he promised on the campaign trail. For almost every instance, Greene has been there to articulate the disconnect. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June, Greene was among  those who questioned  how that fit with Trump's promise to end wars. \"Six months in Steve, and here we are turning back on the campaign promises and we bombed Iran on behalf of Israel,\" Greene said on Steve Bannon's War Room show. As some Republicans expressed concern over humanitarian conditions caused by Israel's war in Gaza, Greene called Israel's actions \"genocide\" on social media. In October, the Trump White House authorized a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina in an effort to stabilize the South American country's economy and suggested plans to  increase Argentine beef imports . U.S. cattle ranchers and a slew of Republican lawmakers pushed back to little avail. Speaking to Tucker Carlson last month, Greene said the money the administration is shepherding to Argentina is \"one of the grossest things\" she has ever seen and \"doesn't understand how that is America First.\" \"It's honestly a punch in the gut to all of our American cattle ranchers and they are furious and rightfully so,\" Greene said. Then there's Republican unease with things like mass deportations and tariffs, restricting tech visas and redistricting, as different pockets of the party's big tent object to key pieces of Trump's second-term agenda. Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't changed Unlike others who have criticized Trump and moved away from the Republican Party, Greene is still one of the most conservative members of Congress and her clash with Trump does not change her ideological consistency. Although her apology for prior toxicity, conflict with the president and appearances on forums like The View and CNN might seem to some like a pivot, Greene isn't actually changing anything about her conservative populist message – just noting ways that Republicans haven't lived up to her views. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over the last few weeks there were also signs that Trump would eventually lash out online and disown Greene politically. \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\"  Trump said . \"She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\" Some Republicans – including Greene – would argue that it's Trump who's lost his way. \"I think that the American people deserve to be put first,\" she said on CNN Sunday. \"That's what 'Make America Great Again,' meant to me and I think that President Trump can do that if he refocuses his effort.\" At last year's Republican National Convention, Greene called Trump the \"founding father\" of the \"America First\" movement. Now she's asserting that \"founding father\" does not equal sole arbiter of what the movement looks like moving forward. The president's changing hold over the GOP  Trump has dominated the Republican Party for a decade by creating a big tent of many different – and sometimes conflicting – ideological groups and getting them to agree to his views and priorities. That's starting to change, especially as he faces record unpopularity and continues to break with his base's ideas of conservatism. Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterms, and it's not clear how much influence he will wield over who Republican primary voters pick in the 2028 presidential contest. In what would always have been a question of what a post-Trump GOP looks like, Greene's criticism is forcing Republicans to confront that question much earlier than they had planned – and with much less certainty about the possible directions the party might go. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-maduro-removal-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-05:00","title":"Trump likely to face long military commitment and chaos if he ousts Maduro in Venezuela, experts say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has expressed strong views that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s rule is ending and has considered launching land strikes or covert operations to remove him.

promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been  weighing . The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the  ongoing drug boat campaign  have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he’s closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.\n \n\n   \n  But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?’ It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.\n \n\n   \n  Another possibility would be a military takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “If the military is still cohesive, and I don’t think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.\n \n\n   \n  Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he’s been politically dead since last year’s election, but if he leaves there’s nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”\n \n\n   \n    Opposition Figures\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.\n \n\n   \n  One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that  the US said Maduro lost , says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela’s government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it’s really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”\n \n\n   \n  US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year’s election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition’s enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.\n \n\n   \n  Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.\n \n\n   \n  “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump’s commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won’t work.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine’ talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n    Entanglements\n \n\n   \n  Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.\n \n\n   \n  The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.\n \n\n   \n  All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro’s ouster, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  This is something that has happened in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also  previously told CNN  that the assembled hardware and troops aren’t enough for a full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A Collection of Featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts is presented on the Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel, showcasing live musical performances in a minimalist, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Music","Live Performances","Home Page","Carousel"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/indian-americans-racism-maga-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:05:00Z","title":"Racists Are Now Openly Targeting Indian Americans","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing wave of racism and xenophobia is targeting Indian Americans in the United States, especially on social media platforms like X, following Diwali posts from political figures including FBI Director Kash Patel, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and Vice President JD Vance.

6:05 PM EST, Sun November 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Last month, FBI Director Kash Patel wished his followers on  X  a happy Diwali. It did not go over well.\n \n\n   \n  Far-right Christian nationalist and white nationalist accounts flooded his post with bigoted memes and rhetoric. “Go back home and worship your sand demons,” a far-right pastor wrote. “Get the f**k out of my country,” read another reply. Said another, “This is America. We don’t do this.” These responses, some of which were seen millions of times, were on the tamer end of the spectrum.\n \n\n   \n  Similar hostility followed Diwali greetings on X from former UN ambassador  Nikki Haley , former presidential candidate  Vivek Ramaswamy  and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights  Harmeet Dhillon , as well as posts about the holiday from the  White House , the  State Department , Texas Gov.  Greg Abbott  and Arkansas Gov.  Sarah Huckabee Sanders .\n \n\n   \n  Some Indian American conservatives seem shocked that segments of the political right are now taking aim at them. When Democrats won big on election night, Ramaswamy  advised  Republicans to “cut out the identity politics,” saying “we don’t care about the color of your skin or your religion. We care about the content of your character.” After one X user said that the existence of Indians disgusted them, Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing commentator who has peddled  racism  against  Black Americans  for decades,  mused : “In a career spanning 40 years, I have never encountered this type of rhetoric. The Right never used to talk like this. So who on our side has legitimized this type of vile degradation?”\n \n\n   \n  This type of degrading rhetoric is  not   new , but it’s increasingly prominent from the  political right . With the rise of  once-fringe figures , and with President Donald Trump aggressively cracking down on  nearly   every type of immigration , some members of the MAGA coalition are openly suggesting that only white Christians belong in America.\n \n\n   \n  “The call is coming from inside the house,” said Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an editorial manager and analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who has examined anti-Indian hate speech and the far right online.\n \n\n   \n  Indian immigrants and Indian Americans — or anyone perceived as Indian — are the latest target of a growing anti-migrant movement in the US and  around   the world . Over the past year, researchers at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate have documented a  surge  of  anti-Indian sentiment  on X that is showing no signs of abating. Raqib Naik, the center’s founder and executive director, said that his team recorded nearly 2,700 posts promoting racism and xenophobia against Indians and Indian Americans in October alone. At least some of that might be explained by Elon Musk’s transformation of the platform: Since he took over, racist content that would previously have been policed by content moderators is now amplified and encouraged. (X did not respond to a request for comment.)\n \n\n   \n  As with the Diwali outrage, these attitudes flare up at times when India or Indians are in the news: Trump’s appointment of  Sriram Krishnan  as senior adviser on artificial intelligence, Ramaswamy criticizing American culture as mediocre in a  social media post , escalations in the  US-India trade war  and a  fatal accident  in Florida involving a Sikh truck driver.\n \n\n   \n  But the most consistent anti-Indian bigotry online focuses on the H-1B visa program, of which Indian nationals are the  biggest beneficiaries , Naik and other researchers said. The program, which admits highly skilled foreigners into the US to work in specialized fields, has sparked  infighting among Trump supporters , with visa opponents such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller  accusing  India of “a lot of cheating on immigration policies.” While the president’s stance on the issue has fluctuated, he recently restricted access to H-1B visas by imposing a  $100,000 application fee .\n \n\n   \n  Far-right accounts and actors now routinely frame Indian immigrants as scammers who are depriving Americans of high-paying jobs and call to deport them. They accuse Indians of hiring only within their caste or ethnicity, invoke stereotypes about Indians being dirty or smelly, and highlight behaviors like eating with one’s hands as cultural backwardness. It isn’t just far-right trolls who invoke these tropes — during the recent New York City mayoral race, the independent campaign of former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo released (then quickly deleted) an  AI-generated attack ad  depicting Zohran Mamdani sloppily eating rice with his hands.\n \n\n   \n   Slurs directed at South Asians,  some of which originated on the largely unmoderated online forum 4chan, are  surging  and entering the lexicon, both online and offline. Photos and videos selectively showing Indian-origin people in public places are held up as evidence of an “invasion,” another iteration of white “ replacement theory .” These attitudes didn’t emerge in a vacuum. Even before Trump was first elected, powerful figures in his movement including Steve Bannon and Miller were referencing the 1970s novel “ The Camp of the Saints ” as a cautionary tale — in the book, a favorite of white supremacists, a fleet of Indian migrants led by a feces-eating farmer invades France and overthrows the Western world.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop of racist and  economic grievance , the success and prominence of Indian Americans make them an easy target, said Rohit Chopra, a professor at Santa Clara University who studies far-right online communities and who co-authored the reports for the Center for the Study of Organized Hate with Naik. Indian immigrants and Indian Americans are among the  highest-earning  ethnic groups in the US, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. They’ve ascended to top government posts and are CEOs of billion-dollar companies. They’re represented at the highest levels of media, entertainment, technology, business, medicine and academia.\n \n\n   \n  “The public image of the Indian community has been that of these basically successful tech professionals and CEOs,” Chopra said. “And the Indian community and Indian American community significantly plays up that image too.”\n \n\n   \n  This image certainly doesn’t reflect all Indian Americans, a religiously and ethnically diverse group that includes US citizens, legally authorized visa workers, international students and undocumented migrants. But as long-simmering resentment against affluent Indian Americans metastasizes into a demonization of the entire community, Chopra said there’s a danger that this could inspire real-world violence.\n \n\n   \n    Indian Americans are feeling the hostility offline\n \n\n   \n  Already, anti-Indian attitudes online are spilling over into everyday life.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, a city councilmember in  Palm Bay, Florida,  repeatedly denigrated Indians and called for their mass deportation on social media, leading to censure and calls for his removal. In Irving, Texas, a Dallas suburb home to thousands of Indian tech professionals, three masked men staged a  roadside protest  carrying signs that read “Don’t India My Texas,” “Deport H-1B Visa Scammers” and “Reject Foreign Demons.”\n \n\n   \n  Stephanie Chan, Stop AAPI Hate’s director of data and research, recounted a recent conversation with a South Asian community leader in Texas who told her white supremacist groups were harassing people outside Hindu temples. Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Manjusha Kulkarni said she overheard people at a Diwali party talking about readying their OCI cards — which allow foreign citizens of Indian origin to live and work in India indefinitely — just in case.\n \n\n   \n  Racist incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate this year and shared with CNN also suggest that anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and parts of his coalition is inspiring hostility. One woman in Georgia shared that a fellow customer at a fast food restaurant threatened to call ICE to get her deported back to India. Another woman in Texas reported that a man who came into her workplace yelled profanities at her and a coworker, saying “I am glad Trump is deporting you b*tches. I hope you have a green card.”\n \n\n   \n  Salil Maniktahla, an Indian American who lives in Springfield, Virginia, said he was similarly accosted while dining at a restaurant with a friend earlier this year. A man hurled slurs at him, said Trump was president and told him to “go home” and “do Bharatanatyam,” referring to a South Indian classical dance. The man also threatened them with violence and waited for them outside, resulting in Maniktahla’s friend calling the police.\n \n\n   \n  “What I see now is that a lot of people are mouthing off in ways that they felt they were prevented from doing prior to 2016,” Maniktahla said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about backlash to officials’ Diwali posts online, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “The President is a fierce defender of religious liberty and cherishes his deep and longstanding relationship with this patriotic community.” As racist, nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric continues to proliferate on the right, Trump and Vice President JD Vance have done little to quell it.\n \n\n   \n  Vance, whose wife Usha Vance is Indian American,  dismissed  remarks from a government staffer such as “normalize Indian hate” as  youthful indiscretion .\n \n\n   \n  Vance has also furthered ideas underlying such bigotry, though with more delicate language. In a  speech  at the Claremont Institute in July, he ruminated on what it meant to be an American. Merely embracing the nation’s foundational principles was not enough, he said, because it would potentially open the country to millions of foreigners and exclude some on the right who reject those same ideals. A better criterion might be  one’s heritage , he added: “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong.”\n \n\n   \n  In the speech, Vance conceded that there was room in the US for some immigrants, so long as they demonstrated sufficient gratitude. Too many, though, would threaten the fabric of the nation, he argued. “And what we’re doing is recognizing that if you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow that social cohesion to form naturally,” he said. “It’s hard to become neighbors with your fellow citizens when your own government keeps on importing new neighbors every single year at a record number.”\n \n\n   \n  At this year’s White House Diwali celebration, Kash Patel used a conspicuous turn of phrase — one seemingly meant to distinguish himself from another kind of immigrant.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an honor to be a first-generation Indian American whose parents lawfully immigrated to this country,”  he said .\n \n\n   \n  To some Trump supporters responding online to his remarks, it didn’t seem to matter that Patel’s parents entered the US legally or that he was a dutiful member of the Trump administration. “Go celebrate your foreign gods back home in India. America is a Christian nation,” one user wrote. Said another, “Hard to think of something less American. This is an abomination.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that sections of the Indian American community have been living in this fool’s paradise,” Chopra said.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “This should serve as a kind of wake-up call — that racism that’s directed at people of color and minority groups, you are not exempt from. And maybe that should spark some kind of reflection about questions of solidarity with other vulnerable groups.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-12312","dateOfPublication":"2023-06-01","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45Z","title":"Community Engagement Initiative Launches in Greenfield Neighborhood to Foster Cultural Exchange and Civic Participation","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new Community Engagement Initiative has been launched in the Greenfield Neighborhood to promote civic involvement and cultural exchange.

Cliff Tan , a London-based architect who runs  dearmodern , a design account on TikTok with nearly 3 million followers, has some ideas on how to upgrade your living area — without spending a lot of money on new furniture, renovating or moving house. These ideas are inspired by the principles of feng shui, the ancient Chinese practice of designing spaces to promote harmony. When decorating, you want to consider the flow of energy in your home and create \"an environment that makes you feel good and supports whatever you're doing,\" Tan says. That might mean rearranging your existing furniture, being intentional about the purpose of each room and adding more light to your space. Tan, author of the 2022 book  Feng Shui Modern , shares simple, low-cost ways to transform your home environment. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Keep the entrance to your home unobstructed \"The front entrance is the most important part of the home,\" says Tan. And it's often people's first impression of the house — not just for visitors but for yourself as well. In feng shui, the doorway is a gateway for life energy, or chi. And you can do a lot to affect how energy flows through it, says Tan. One way is to make sure the doorway is as unobstructed as possible. Examine your entryway. Is there a lot of clutter around it, like shoes, coats, bags or umbrellas? Or \"a pile of recycling bags that you have to kick every time you open the door?\" says Tan. Find ways to keep the area clear. Put items back in the shoe rack or the coat closet where they belong. Or repurpose a table or bench from another part of your house to neatly store your recycling (in a cute bin if you can find one) and your keys. 2. Handle the ugly things first So you're gazing around the house, an ongoing list of projects dancing in your head. Where should you start? \"With the ugliest things in your life,\" says Tan. \"Deal with the worst things first. That's where the impact is greatest. There's no point in creating a cute shelf in the kitchen when every time you walk in, you see this shoe rack and it makes you angry.\" If one bad element is ruining your harmonious feelings about your space, \" fix that first ,\" says Tan. It will free up your energy to make more balancing adjustments. Put the shoe rack somewhere else — or if you want to leave it in your kitchen, \"make it nice,\" says Tan. \"Paint it pink, build a curtain around it.\" The way you problem-solve can turn an annoyance into a statement piece or even a favorite part of your home. 3. Spend your time in the nicest part of the house Walk through your house and ask yourself, \"Which is the nicest part?\" says Tan. The most pleasant areas are usually by a window. As a source of light and natural ventilation, they can help circulate light, air and energy. That's where you want to spend most of your time. \"This sounds like common sense, but you'd be surprised how often this is not done,\" says Tan. For example, some people who work from home tuck their desk away in a dark corner because they don't want to be reminded of work when they're off the clock, says Tan. \"Even though they spend eight hours a day working, they'd rather have their empty couch in the beautiful sunlight.\" So move your desk by a window and \"let the light shine on your face, which can also give the impression that the room is much brighter,\" says Tan. 4. Create an energy that makes you feel safe and comfortable When you're at home, you want to feel safe and secure, says Tan. In feng shui, you can achieve that by placing yourself in what is called the \"command position,\" he says. Whatever is behind you should be nice and sturdy and make you feel in charge of the space. In a bedroom, always put your bed against a solid wall, and try not to point your feet toward any openings in the room, says Tan. Too much energy comes through doors, and that can make sleepers feel vulnerable. And don't put your head next to a door. \"I will do anything I can to keep my head safe from all that movement.\" 5. Use multiple lamps to create warmth and consistency According to feng shui, supplementing any natural phenomenon (like light) must be done with care. To mimic the varying lights and shadows in our natural environment, use multiple sources of indirect light to illuminate a room, says Tan. A big, overhead light glares \"down the floor\" and casts strong, unnatural shadows. Table lights and spotlights, however, create depth by giving you more control over the direction and quality of light. Use these smaller lights to highlight areas of focus, like a piece of artwork or a reading nook. To create a sense of warmth and consistency in your home, \"make sure all your bulbs are the same color temperature,\" says Tan. He recommends bulbs between 2700 and 3000 kelvins. They offer a cozy, relaxing glow. 6. Consider a room's dimensions when picking out furniture Social media can be an exciting place to find interior design ideas, but what might work in one room may not work in another. That's how you end up with a beautiful round table that looks lost in your long, rectangular dining room, says Tan. \"It's too fat, it's too short and it doesn't fill up the space.\" When designing a room, the goal is to optimize flow, says Tan. You want to keep energy from moving too quickly through the space, but a room that's too stuffy or cumbersome to navigate around can also feel stagnant.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So pick furniture that interacts well with the room. You don't want a coffee table so large that you're always barking your shins when you try to get up, and you also don't want two small armchairs in a zone that would be much better for a full-size couch. \"Nothing beats working with your space,\" says Tan. Your furniture should showcase the best qualities of the room and \"make the space as good as it can be.\" This episode was produced by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:   Hey. What's up, everybody? Andrew Limbong here, in for Marielle Segarra. My first solo apartment sucked (laughter). It was in a basement in Washington, D.C, and it was small and dark and kind of muggy all the time, but the thing that bothered me the most about it - the thing that still bothers me today - was that the kitchen sink was so small, you literally couldn't fit a plate in it. Like, a lone plate had to go in diagonally, and not only that, but the faucet, for some reason, was extra long, and so in order to use the sink and not get water all over the floor, you had to shimmy it to the side a bit. I did not like being there, but I also didn't do anything to make it better. I figured, why bother? Who cares? I'm just renting, so there's no point in putting any effort into the place. It's an attitude entirely based on some imagined future where I'm in the perfect place where I could really let my aesthetic dreams flourish, but there really is no reason to wait. On this episode of LIFE KIT, reporter Adwoa Gyimah-Brempong is going to walk us through some ways to make those apartment decor dreams a reality - right where you are. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ADWOA GYIMAH-BREMPONG, BYLINE: I have moved a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Right now, I live in a cute little one-bedroom apartment. It's the eighth long-term lease that I've had in my adult life. For all of that time, I've been a renter, and I'm not alone. As of 2017, when I was on my sixth apartment, there were more renters in America than there had been in the previous 50 years, and as of 2022, about half of American renters were what's known as cost-burden. That means they're paying more than 30% of their income in rent. People are renting for much longer than they have in the past, twice as long as they were in the 1970s. Within that group is a subset known as forever renters - folks who don't own their homes and, by circumstance or by choice, maybe never will. So what's a forever renter to do? A tiny kitchen that might not bother you in a six-month lease may be a lot more frustrating after two years, and you may not be overflowing with cash to solve the problem. Enter DIYs. My current apartment has bright walls, a ton of storage and plenty of places to hang plants, bags and lighting. None of that was here when I moved in. I did it myself. I spend a lot of time in this space, so it's important that it feel good to me. CLIFF TAN: The first thing is really understanding your space. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAN: It's better to kind of understand and appreciate what your space can give than to try to force it away. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's Cliff Tan. He's the architect, author and feng shui practitioner known as dearmodern on Instagram and TikTok. Cliff says it's important to use your senses to figure out what a space has going for it. TAN: Where is the nicest part of the space? Where's the less nice part of the space? Most of the time, the best part of the space is where there's a window, nice fresh air, nice natural ventilation. The worst part of the space is probably, like, far, far away in the darkness or something like that, close to the entrance way. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So takeaway one - get to know your space, but it's just as important to get to know yourself. How do you want your home to support you? TAN: So what you want to do next is to understand what activities you spend most time doing. If you spend most of your time on your couch, watching TV, you want to be close to the window. If you spend most of your time working from home, you want that close to the window, too. So it's about placing your most frequent activities closer to the nicest part of the home. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I work from home, and I'm a homebody. A big, cozy couch is more important to me than a desk or a formal dining room table, and I didn't have room for both, so I installed a cute little gateleg table that folds down against one wall. Now, I have a working surface when I need one and a place to hang out the rest of the time. Cliff says it's also important to understand not just where things are placed in your home, but how that feels. TAN: Energy makes its way through your home based on how you flow through your home, so this is why the same home can have different energy paths depending on who lives in it. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And that's why it's important to start your arrival off right. TAN: The front entrance is the most important part of the home, because that's your first impression - not just for new guests who come, not just about showing off how beautiful your home is - it's also to yourself. You need to feel good every time you come home. Even something as simple as having a pile of recycling bags right by the entrance that you have to kick every time you open the door - you have to push the door, to shove it in to go through - that is enough to minus two points every time you come home, which, compiled over 10 years, you will hate your home, and you can't wait to move. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: When I first moved in, my home had no storage in the entryway whatsoever. I was always putting my purse on the ground and forgetting gym supplies across the house, so I installed hooks for my bags, keys and even a hand fan. Then I upcycled an IKEA shoe cabinet that now does triple duty as a linen closet, workout supply storage and a gathering point for my electronics. That brings us to takeaway two... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: ...Don't get hung up on what something is supposed to be for. Think about what you could turn it into instead. This is how bread baskets turn into side tables and tomato cages can become plant stands. AMANDA POE: I think so many times, renters feel really restricted by the exact thing that they have in their home. And I think there's a really easy way to look around and say, what do I really wish this apartment had and see if there's a way to make that happen. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's Amanda Poe. She's an attorney by day, and she also runs the home decor Instagram page Bohofrisco. The project grew out of her frustration with beige, white and neutral-heavy home decor stores. POE: The desired to DIY really came from not being able to source the colorful things that I wanted, and so making them on my own was the best way to find them. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: You probably have at least one interior design dream. Some people want a claw-foot tub. I would love a lofted bed one day. And for Amanda, that element was a fireplace. POE: I was always so jealous that people were decorating seasonally for their mantles. You know, they were putting their garlands or their wreath above it. And then I realized, like, oh, if only I had a fireplace. And so with a couple of pieces of wood, and a weekend, we built one. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So you're gazing around the house, an ongoing list of projects dancing in your head. Where should you start? TAN: I will say you start with the ugliest things in your home then. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: (Laughter). TAN: Like, it sounds funny but, like, look for the things that are actually ugly in your home, like the shoe rack. You deal with the worst things first. That's where the impact is the greatest. Because it's like no point creating a cute little shelf in the kitchen when every time you walk home, you see the shoe rack and it makes you angry. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So Cliff brings us takeaway three - start with the worst thing first. Once you've improved whatever bothers you the most, the statement pieces can follow, and he's so right. I hated the overhead light in my place so much - so much. It wasn't until I brought in some funky lamps and could really turn off the big light that the room came to life. So think about what's bothering you about your space - the lack of storage in the closet or nowhere to put all your books - and focus on that first. Contractor lights aside, my apartment was pretty great when I moved in. I have three criteria that are non-negotiable - good light, top floor, no carpet. But several people I spoke to told me they took much bigger risks when selecting their spaces, including Chyelle Milgrom, also known as fbmarketslut on Instagram and TikTok. She finds gorgeous vintage pieces, as is or for restoration on Facebook Marketplace. Today, her apartment is lovely. It has huge windows and a ton of cool projects, including painted doors and a glass brick wall. But when she first viewed it... CHYELLE MILGROM: The moment we stepped into this apartment, our, like, eyes burned. It, like, reeked. It smelled like cat [expletive] and feces. I have, old videos on my Instagram of what it looked like previously, but there was, like, green and red walls. There was, like, fluorescent blue murals somewhere. It was really a [expletive] mess, and it was, like, absolutely horrific. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: After cleaning it within an inch of its life, the first thing she tackled was the paint. And Amanda gives us the details on why. That's takeaway four. Paint is a high-impact upgrade. You may be thinking, am I allowed to do that? The official answer is, check your lease. But on a practical level... MILGROM: When you paint a wall, all you have to do is paint it back. That's it. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I love paint projects, both on and off the walls. But I don't always get it right on the first try. And there's a pink wall in my house that I painted three separate times until I got the color right. Amanda had some tips for me on how to minimize the guesswork. POE: You really need to start with a swatch. You bring those home into your space, not the fluorescent lighting of the store. Then you move on to a paint sample. Also the different walls, even in your room, are going to look different. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I found that one out the hard way. My living room faces south onto a balcony. So the space gets very different amounts of light throughout the year. It's brighter in winter when the sun is low enough to shine directly into the room. So the little patch I painted didn't show me what the whole wall would look like when it was done. POE: Let's go big. Let's not try to imagine the whole room with a Post-It note size swatch. Let's get a poster board from the store, spend $1 on it, paint the whole swatch, and stick that on every wall, you know, trying different times, mornings, afternoon. The time you're going to spend in the room. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: The other nice thing about paint is that it's reversible. Many DIYers will say that for some projects, it's better to ask forgiveness than permission. But with repainting, if you're thorough, it will look like that pink wall was never there. Amanda has a series called \"Renter-Friendly Reality Check,\" where she brings viewers along on the takedown process of a project. I asked her how she handles paint situations that need a more serious rescue. Some landlords do leave paint in an apartment for minor patches, so you could always ask. But if you're flying under the radar, here's how to make it work. POE: I would say the most important things are the sheen, obviously, and the color. And so even if you color match perfectly, but you get the sheen wrong, the place that you repaired is going to stick out so bad. I would say when your paint is peeling, like, maybe your project has gone wrong, pulling up like more than an inch of a swatch, like something bigger than a quarter, that is going to give you the best surface so that you can take it to your local hardware store, and they have a system that will paint match it with a computer. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Then she dropped some wisdom on me that I could have definitely used in one of my first college apartments. POE: Sometimes you can peel up paint from places like a really common place to grab some paint would be behind an outlet cover, because if you peel some of that paint away, you can put the outlet cover back and it would never know that that paint was missing. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I loved it. (LAUGHTER) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: This is brilliant. So a little paint can go a long way. But there's another element that can completely transform a space. Chyelle and Cliff agree. Takeaway five - lighting is the key to a room. MILGROM: Lighting is, like, the biggest thing that affects a space. I think it's the most pervasive as well as it can be the most eye-catching thing. TAN: Because a light is a light, it actually glows, so it attracts your attention. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: That's for better or for worse, as I discovered in my living room. There's an ongoing TikTok trend called we never use the big light. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: I don't have many rules for my house, but I do have one, and that is that we never, ever, ever, ever use the big light. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: The big light is that central overhead lighting that is so common in rental units. It can bring a harsh energy to a space. But even if you draw the short end of the stick as far as lighting goes, Cliff says there are ways to work around it. TAN: If you are going to rent for longer, you could change your - let's say you have canned lights. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Canned lights are those recessed lights in the ceiling. They're like a step up from the standard contractor rental light. TAN: You could buy canned lights that are adjustable, meaning you can point them in different directions. Find the same can light with the same hole size and just replace them one for one. And then you have all these canned lights that can now point around. And I can shine it onto your artwork, shine it onto your table, and create focal points. Instead of just glaring down the floor, you can create a bit of depth using the lights that you already have. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And even if you don't change any fixtures at all, there are other things you can do to make a space feel cohesive. TAN: Make sure all your bulbs are the same color temperature, which is like 2,700 Kelvins, 3,000 Kelvins. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Light comes on a spectrum from cool to warm. Cool light is bright and good for task-oriented spaces like a kitchen. Warm light, in the 2,700 to 3,000 Kelvin range, is nice and relaxing. TAN: Decide on one and make sure your whole house is the same. It will make your house more consistent. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: My place has a bit of everything - rewired sconces from big-box stores, DIY mushroom lamps, paper lanterns. My favorite is a two-foot-tall table lamp shaped like a miner from the San Francisco gold rush. Just like my Ikea entryway, once you start looking at form instead of function, there are so many great places to find things to upcycle. Thrift stores and architectural salvages are a great source of raw materials. When you find a good one, become buddies with the people who work there. Do they get their best deliveries on a certain day? Find out when that is. I have a rule that I don't spend more than $100 on anything other than a couch or a bed. So for online shopping, I'll figure out what I want, set some Craigslist alerts and wait. Chyelle has some Facebook marketplace search tips, too, and they do not involve typing out fancy designer names. MILGROM: If I actually did that on Facebook, then it would show me a bunch of people who know exactly what they're selling, and will sell it for those expensive prices, which, you know, good for them. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: But those of us with champagne tastes on a beer budget are probably better off finding people who just want to get that old piece of furniture out of their grandma's basement. MILGROM: And normally, those people will just use very generic language, for instance, teak shelving unit or wood shelving unit. Funky is another keyword that I like to use if you want to, like, find a funky chair. Sometimes you'll get lucky, and you'll find, like, an Eames. Keep it generic. And if you are going to go specific, then be willing to, like, open your wallets wide. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: If the photos of that Eames chair look like stock images and the price is suspiciously low, remember to keep an eye out for scammers. MILGROM: Always look at their profile. You can look at their account. You can see, like, when they opened their account. For instance, my Facebook, it's been open since, like, 2009, back when, like, I was in middle school or elementary school. It kind of shows you that I'm a real person and I've got, like, real friends and whatnot and, like, embarrassing profile pictures versus someone who, like, just opened their account last year and has one picture and no friends. Kind of shows you who might be a scammer. Also, if they ask for, like, Zelle upfront, then they're probably a scammer. Try not to pay anyone anything until you see the item in person. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: In your DIY journey, you'll likely need to fix something you found on Facebook marketplace or maybe you want to customize a goodwill frame. So takeaway six - when assembling what you need, get creative. Whether it's an actual thrift store, a reuse market or an Ikea hack, think big about how to find what you need for a project. And that's not just materials, but all the tools you need to get your project done. My DIY starter kit has five elements. First, a measuring tape. And I carry a small one with me at all times, just in case I come across something that could work for an ongoing project. Then a small set of basic tools like screwdrivers, pliers and a hammer. A level is important for anything that's going to have a flat surface. A drill, drill bits, and drywall anchors are probably my most used tools. You can use those for anything from hanging something on a wall to drilling a hole in ceramics to use as a pot for plants. And lastly, those paint supplies, but there are also larger supplies that you may not need to keep on hand. A lot of public library systems have tool-lending libraries that members can use. There are also maker spaces with larger things like saws, and some hardware stores will rent out tools as well. I've done plenty of projects I probably wouldn't try again as a renter - stapling fabric to the wall instead of wallpaper, for example. But finding a beautiful solution to what started out as a problem can be a real source of pride. POE: Yeah. It's that urge when someone says, where'd you get that? And then you say, I made it. It's like being an artist, and people come inside your canvas. They come over for dinner inside of your artwork. And that feels really cool. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: And you might be living with that canvas longer than you think, as Amanda and I have both learned. How long have you been renting? POE: Our last apartment, we were there for over 10 years in the same space. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Did you expect to be there for that long? POE: Oh, no. I - (laughter) I first signed, like, a 90-day lease (laughter). GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Oh, wow. (LAUGHTER) POE: Yeah. And when we moved out, it just kept occurring to me if someone had said in that first month, you know, you're going to be here for 10 years - how many more chances I would have taken, how many more times I would have painted the walls or I would have done something that I wanted. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Some of you might still be asking, why bother to fix up a rental? Why build a fireplace or customized shelving or do anything that would threaten your deposit when it's time to leave? POE: I mean, to those people, like, do you spend money on a great dinner? Do you spend money on a concert? These are also things that are not permanent, and they improve our life in so many ways. And to the extent that maybe I'll only love it for a year, that's a really significant amount of time. Life is so short. And I think to the extent that I can decorate a room or paint a wall and make the next six weeks just full of joy every time I walk into my bedroom, I really don't think there's a much better investment. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GYIMAH-BREMPONG: So just to recap. Takeaway one - understand your space, which also means understanding yourself. Takeaway two - don't feel limited by an item's purpose or by what you already have in your home. Imagine what you'd like to see instead, and then figure out how to make it happen. Takeaway three - when in doubt, start with the ugliest thing in your house. Takeaway four - paint is a high-impact way to transform the space. Takeaway five - lighting is the most important part of your home. Turn off the big light and make way for table lamps, sconces and directional light. Takeaway six - get creative with where to find tools and materials. And one last thing. Don't think of yourself as less than just because you rent. POE: The temporariness of a rental is freedom. It's a get - you know, if the wall color doesn't suit you, repaint it, you know? But if the whole apartment doesn't suit you, move. That's not a choice that people that own their home get to do. GYIMAH-BREMPONG: Forever renters, we have our answer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

Economists counter that the idea is not as extreme as it appears—especially given that most Americans don’t stay in a home for 50 years and can refinance. The article highlights that while long-term fixed mortgages reduce monthly payments and offer stability, they also carry risks such as going underwater during market downturns and locking homeowners into long-term debt. It also critiques the broader U.S. mortgage system, noting that government-backed institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac enabled the dominance of 30-year fixed rates, which distort monetary policy and create inequality due to financial literacy disparities. Ultimately, while a 50-year mortgage may help affordability for some, experts agree that building more homes—not just offering new mortgage products—is the true solution to housing affordability.","keyTakeAways":["A 50-year mortgage is not as outlandish as it seems and may offer lower monthly payments, improving affordability for some homebuyers.","The U.S. mortgage system is unique due to widespread 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, largely enabled by government-backed entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.","Long-term fixed-rate mortgages, whether 30 or 50 years, delay principal repayment and increase risk of going underwater during housing market downturns.","Fixed-rate mortgages shield homeowners from interest rate changes, which can distort monetary policy and reduce economic responsiveness during inflation or recession.","Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages face financial lock-in, especially if they are reluctant to move, contributing to high housing prices and market stagnation.","Financial literacy disparities lead to unequal outcomes, with minority borrowers and less-educated individuals often missing refinancing opportunities and paying higher rates.","While 50-year mortgages may help some buyers, they do not solve housing affordability;

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes. \"It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,\"  posted  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). \"In debt forever, in debt for life!\" President Trump \"is creating generational debt,\" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. \"They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'\" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.) The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to  reporting from  Politico . Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea? \"It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,\" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University. \"Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,\" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.\" The 50 vs The 30 First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move. In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages. The typical American homeowner spends  less than 12 years  in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses. \" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,\" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. \"I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.\" In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.  \"I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,\" Zwick says. \"And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.\" And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree. And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than  90% of American mortgage holders  have one! The American mortgage market is weird The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries. We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a  Planet Money  episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates. Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks. A long time ago,  Planet Money  interviewed  financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as \"a financial Frankenstein's monster\" from the perspective of lenders. Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, \"I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,\" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University. \" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,\" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world. The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages  There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them. Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent). Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation! The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much. But there's more. If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth. \" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,\" Gyourko says. \" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.\" Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks. If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, \"your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,\" says Berger, the economist at Duke. \"No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,\" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house. \"And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,\" Gyourko says. \"So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.\" Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession. \" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,\" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says. Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, \"you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,\" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage. \" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,\" Fairweather says. \"But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.\" Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates. One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s. \"The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,\" Gyourko says. Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy). That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy. In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair. Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality. \"A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,\" Campbell says. \"And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers.\" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates. There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move. Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been  stubbornly high  over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years. \" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,\" Fairweather says. \"So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.\" Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move. The real fix for housing affordability So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage. The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out. The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem. \"Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,\" Campbell says. \"Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.\" So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them. Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated! \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5508871","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:38:00-05:00","title":"Trump Makes a U-Turn on the Epstein Files: A Timeline of Shifting Stance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article chronicles a significant shift in President Donald Trump’s stance on the Jeffrey Epstein case, from initially resisting the release of related files to publicly urging House Republicans to vote for their release.

Here's a timeline of his shifting stance \n         By Rachel Treisman, Bill Chappell \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 2:38 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In a major about-face, President Trump has called on House Republicans to vote to release the files of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of refusing to do so and mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in the Manhattan facility where he was being held on charges that he  operated a sex-trafficking ring  preying on young women and underage girls. Officials later concluded he died by suicide. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But public skepticism about his death — and allegations that his wealthy, powerful network helped facilitate and cover up his crimes — persist, dogging the Trump administration in particular. The names of a number of powerful figures have appeared in already-released documents related to Epstein's case, including Trump and former President Bill Clinton, both of whom socialized with Epstein. Appearing in Epstein's flight logs and other records, however, is not an indication of wrongdoing. Trump has long resisted the release of additional files from the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, despite promising on the campaign trail that he would do so if reelected. That unfulfilled promise has been the center of growing public controversy, conspiracy theories and pressure from Congress in the months since he took office. Prominent Republicans from House Speaker Mike Johnson to former Vice President Mike Pence have called for more transparency on the Epstein case, along with influential right-wing conspiracy promoters, including media figures such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And Democrats on the House Oversight Committee continue to apply pressure by subpoenaing and releasing thousands of pages of records from the Justice Department, many of which spotlight Epstein's onetime friendship with Trump. The White House has consistently downplayed that relationship — which Trump says ended before Epstein was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006 — and dismissed the controversy as a hoax pushed by Democrats. But after months of opposing the files' release, Trump  said on Sunday  that \"we have nothing to hide\" and that it was time to move on from what he says is a \"Democrat hoax … to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.\" A House vote is expected on Tuesday, but it would be just the first step in a longer process. The House and Senate would both need to vote to release the unclassified files in order for the matter to reach his desk for a signature. Here's a timeline of the Trump administration's shifting tone and actions on the Epstein case. Feb. 21:  Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Epstein client list is \"sitting on my desk\" in an appearance  on Fox News , in response to a question from John Roberts. \"The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients? Will that really happen?\" Roberts asks Bondi. \"It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,\" the attorney general replies. Bondi later says she was referring to the Epstein files, not a client list. But her remark has echoed through discussions of the Epstein story so far this year. Feb. 27:  The White House gives  binders to far-right influencers  bearing a Department of Justice seal and labels reading, \"Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But much of the information turns out to have been released before, and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets,  calls it \"old info.\" July 7:  The Justice Department  releases a memo  saying it has found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" for Epstein, contradicting Bondi's February statement. The agency says it turned up more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence. It also states that \"Epstein harmed over one thousand victims.\" But the DOJ says those victims' sensitive information is \"intertwined\" in the materials and it concludes \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The memo  addresses several hot topics on social media. In addition to rebutting the notion of a client list, it says there's no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures or that his death was anything other than a case of suicide. July 12:  \"We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening,\" Trump  says on Truth Social  in response to his supporters' criticisms of Bondi. The president accuses critics of trying to hurt his administration, \"all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.\" People should let Bondi do her job, Trump says, \"and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\" July 15:  Bondi  refuses to address questions  about her handling of the Epstein files. Trump voices his support, saying his attorney general has \"really done a very good job.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump also suggests people who are fixated on Epstein should move on: \"He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is, I really don't. And the credible information's been given.\" July 16:  Trump  lashes out at fellow Republicans  for fixating on Epstein, calling it a hoax. \"It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats' work,\" Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office. Trump also  suggests he would approve  of Bondi releasing some Epstein documents if they meet a standard: \"Whatever's credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release.\" As NPR's Dominico Montanaro  later reports , it's one of many instances of Trump emphasizing that \"credible evidence\" from the Epstein records should be shared. July 17:  Trump  slams  The Wall Street Journal  after the  paper publishes what it says  is a risqué birthday note Trump wrote to celebrate Epstein's 50th birthday, stating, \"the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE.\" \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" Trump  writes on Truth Social . July 18:  Trump files a  defamation lawsuit against  The Wall Street Journal   over its coverage of his relationship with Epstein, including the birthday note that Trump says he didn't write. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the same day, the DOJ  files a motion in the Southern District of New York  to unseal grand jury testimony related to Epstein's 2019 indictment charging him with sex trafficking offenses, citing \"extensive public interest\" following the agency's July 6 memo. The DOJ later asks to unseal related exhibits, including a PowerPoint presentation and four pages of call logs. The agency files similar motions in New York regarding the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime partner who was sentenced to a 20-year prison term, as well as in Florida, where Epstein  agreed to a plea deal  with U.S. prosecutors in 2007 over the abuse of minor girls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       July 19:  Trump  posts on Truth Social  about his administration's grand jury request, saying he \"asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.\" July 22:  Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche  says he is talking with Maxwell's   lawyer  and expects to meet with her, at Bondi's direction. Trump  says he thinks the plan  \"sounds appropriate.\" July 23:  The Wall Street Journal  reports  that Bondi and other Justice Department officials told Trump in May that his name \"is among many in the Epstein files.\" The newspaper says the officials feel the files contain \"unverified hearsay\" about hundreds of people, including Trump, who were in the same social orbit as Epstein. The same day, federal judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida  denies release  of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. July 24:  Blanche meets with Maxwell in prison for two days, according to  Democratic senators . The DOJ says it's mulling whether to release transcripts of their meeting. July 29:  Trump says he and Epstein  had a falling out  over Epstein hiring girls from his Mar-a-Lago resort, resulting in Epstein being kicked out. A prominent Epstein accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre,  had said  she was a teenager working at Mar-a-Lago when she first met Maxwell and Epstein. Aug. 1 : The Bureau of Prisons says it has moved Maxwell from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Fla., to a women's minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas. Aug. 5:  The House Oversight Committee  subpoenas the Department of Justice  for records related to Epstein and Maxwell. It seeks \"all documents and communications relating or referring to\" the pair and their respective court cases, setting a deadline of Aug. 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Aug. 11:  Federal judge Paul Engelmayer in New York  denies Bondi's request  to unseal grand jury materials from the Maxwell case, saying most of the records are already public. In a rebuke to the DOJ, the judge adds that an observer \"might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\" Aug. 18:  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.,  says the DOJ will send the first batch  of Epstein documents to the panel on Aug. 22, three days after the committee's original deadline. \"It will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,\" Comer says. Aug. 20:  Federal judge Richard M. Berman denies Bondi's request to unseal records related to the Epstein case in New York, citing longstanding precedents of keeping grand jury proceedings secret and stating that the government did not prove \"special circumstances\" that might justify unsealing the records. Aug. 22:  The House Oversight Committee  receives the first batch  of thousands of Epstein-related files from the Justice Department's investigation, some of which it says will eventually become public. Sept. 8:  House Democrats release a copy of Epstein's 50th birthday book with notes from friends and associates, including the tawdry note — framed by a hand-drawn outline of a woman's body —  that appears to bear Trump's signature , despite his denial in July. The White House again dismisses that claim, calling it \"FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sept. 23:  A  statue of Epstein and Trump skipping  hand-in-hand, above a satirical plaque honoring their friendship, appears on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells NPR that \"it's not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep.\" U.S. Park Police abruptly removed the statue for what the Department of Interior later said was permit noncompliance. The protest group behind the bronze installation has since displayed it two more times,  on the Mall in October  and  in front of a D.C. restaurant  in November. Oct. 6:  On the same day that the Supreme Court declines to hear Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, Trump leaves the door open to potentially granting her a pardon — which he  previously told reporters  he was \"allowed\" to do. \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say that, that I'd have to take a look at it,\"  Trump said . \"I will speak to the DOJ.\" Nov. 12:  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rules out a Trump pardon of Maxwell,  telling reporters , \"It's not something he's talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time.\" That same day, the federal government reopens after a record 43-day shutdown. The House returns to session to swear in Democratic  Rep. Adelita Grijalva  of New Mexico, seven weeks after she won a special election to succeed her late father. Grijalva had promised to support forcing a vote on the Epstein files' release, and became the decisive final signature that same day. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee release  three new emails  from Epstein's estate that specifically mention Trump. In one from 2011, Epstein referred to Trump as \"the dog that hasn't barked\" and says he spent \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex trafficking victims. The White House downplays the emails, with Leavitt saying they were \"selectively leaked\" and \"prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.\" Later that day, Republicans release another 20,000 documents, which include emails from Epstein expressing displeasure with Trump and his presidency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Nov. 14:  At Trump's public urging,  Bondi confirms  that the Justice Department will investigate Epstein's alleged \"involvement and relationship\" with banks and several prominent Democrats, including Clinton. That same day, Trump  withdraws his support  of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a longtime ally of the president who publicly broke with him over the Epstein issue. She was one of three Republican women to sign the petition to force a vote on the files' release. Another, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, had  met with White House officials  earlier in the week,  apparently about Epstein , but was not persuaded to change course. Nov. 16:  In a late-night  Truth Social post , Trump says House Republicans should vote to release the files. He stresses that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of pages of records and opened an investigation into Epstein's links to Democrats, and urges Republicans to get \"back on point.\" \"Nobody cared about Jeffrey Epstein when he was alive and, if the Democrats had anything, they would have released it before our Landslide Election Victory,\" he adds. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611103","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:20:00-05:00","title":"CPB agrees to revive a $36 million deal with NPR killed after Trump's pressure","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has agreed to revive a $36 million multi-year contract with National Public Radio (NPR), reversing a decision made under pressure from the Trump White House.

Folkenflik \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 8:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed Monday to fulfill a $36 million, multi-year contract with NPR that it had yanked after pressure from the Trump White House. The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.  The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award a contract instead to Public Media Infrastructure, a new consortium of public media institutions, was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.  \"The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,\" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR,  said in a statement . \"While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.\" In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration. Instead, in  a statement posted on its website , CPB asserted its side \"prevails\" as a result of the settlement.  \"This is an important moment for public media,\" said Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB. \"We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media.\" The contract with PMI will continue, CPB said. Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line  vote over the summer by Congress , called a rescission. Only a  skeleton crew remains at CPB , which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard. Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had  not made a credible case  for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1. CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts. In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract. The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to \" throw the baby out with the bathwater ,\" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids.   NPR's submission proved unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued  a formal statement  that called their offerings \"radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'.\" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias. On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then  filed suit against the White House , saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.   In the summer, Republican leaders in Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president. Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.   NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for next month.

Saudi Crown Prince with big deals being inked \n         By Aya Batrawy, Steve Inskeep \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 4:59 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         DUBAI  –  President Trump is hosting Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House Tuesday for talks expected to produce deals touching on defense, artificial intelligence and nuclear technology. The visit underscores how a close relationship formed under the president's first term is yielding gains that both leaders can tout domestically. Trump has said he will honor Saudi Arabia and the crown prince on this visit, which will be his first trip back to the U.S. since the killing of a prominent Saudi writer and critic seven years ago, which sparked international outcry. While some pomp and pageantry are expected, it's the personal ties between Trump and Prince Mohammed and transactional deals girded by business that will be on display. The trip also marks a turning point for Prince Mohammed; his last visit seven years ago came just months before his aides killed Saudi critic and Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA  concluded the crown prince approved the operation  that killed Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, but Prince Mohammed maintained he had no knowledge of the attack, which he's called \"heinous\" and \"unjustifiable.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The crown prince oversees the kingdom's vast oil wealth. He's has already  vowed to invest $600 billion , or more, in the United States during Trump's time in office, but he wants a defense pact, access to advanced AI chips and a civilian nuclear deal that may involve enrichment outside the kingdom's territory in exchange for the deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons systems on Saudi soil, according to analysts. Prince Mohammed also wants advanced F-35 jets that only Israel currently flies in the Middle East. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that a deal will be happening, though it's unclear if it will be indirectly linked to Trump's ask for Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel. The current far-right Israeli government, however, rejects Saudi conditions for Palestinian statehood. A return to Washington for the crown prince Prince Mohammed was widely condemned following the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the crown prince and columnist for the  Washington Post . Khashoggi fled Riyadh in 2017 to live in self-exile in Virginia. He was killed in Turkey in October 2018, shortly after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. His body was dismembered and never recovered, according to a  U.N. inquiry . A CIA investigation later determined 15 Saudi agents had flown to Istanbul as part of an operation approved by Prince Mohammed. But a lot has changed in the years since. Prince Mohammed has positioned Saudi Arabia as an increasingly influential regional power, and deepened the kingdom's ties with major world leaders – including in the U.S. Analysts say he's returning to Washington as a partner, not a pariah. \"Today, he arrives not as a promising leader, but as a regional power broker and also a global actor whose role you cannot bypass,\" says Saudi political analyst Hesham Alghannam, speaking on a web panel hosted by the Arab Gulf States Institute days before the visit. Despite a continued clampdown on activists and critics in the kingdom, Trump has hailed the prince a great leader, describing him as an \"incredible man\" and \"great guy.\" Saudi Arabia wants U.S. security guarantees Prince Mohammed, known also as MBS, is said to be traveling to Washington with a 1,000-strong entourage that includes his top ministers, security officials and Saudi business leaders. On the agenda are issues ranging from the war in Sudan to the ceasefire in Gaza. The aim of the prince's visit, though, is to firm up his country's ties with the U.S. which remains the kingdom's most important security partner, despite efforts by China and Russia to grow their influence in the region. Analysts say the most important deal he's eyeing, and which is expected to be signed during his time in Washington, is a U.S. defense pact similar to Trump's recent executive order  signed with Qatar  following Israeli and Iranian attacks on the small Gulf state over the summer. A defense pact does not require Congressional approval, making it less binding than a defense treaty, but it still states the U.S. will defend that country through diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military measures in the event of an attack. Bilal Saab, a former adviser at the Pentagon who's with Trends Research and Advisory, said the Saudi defense pact might have a \"little more icing on the cake\" than what was promised to the Qataris, but he says it will similarly offer \"unilateral security guarantees\" from the Trump administration to help the Saudi leadership feel more protected from a variety of threats in the region. Saab said he's against pacts like this that do not also compel countries to protect U.S. assets and personnel in the region. \"The problem is, I don't think the Saudis are in a position to honor any such terms,\" he said. Personal ties underride the visit  Trump is expected to host a dinner for the crown prince while the Saudis are also hosting a major investment forum on the sidelines of the trip with top U.S. executives of major hedge funds, defense firms and technology firms. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Alongside the flurry of bilateral deals are also billions of dollars from the Gulf flowing into Trump family ventures, from crypto to real estate. Raghida Dergham, chair of the Beirut Institute think tank, says there's a blurred line between Trump's family business and his administration. \"And they don't hide it. They don't make that a secret. They think this is part of what happens anywhere in the world,\" she says. \"But it's very unlike the traditions of the United States, because you separate family from country.\" There are several Trump-branded golf courses and towers being developed across the Gulf, including in Saudi Arabia, by a private Saudi developer. Just months after leaving the White House as adviser in Trump's first term, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also got seed money to start his private equity fund from a sovereign wealth fund overseen by the Saudi crown prince: $2 billion worth,  according to the  New York Times   and the  Wall Street Journal . The White House  says there's no conflict of interest , and that it's \"ridiculous\" to suggest he's doing anything for his own benefit. Ultimately, Tuesday's meeting gives Trump an opportunity to tout big investments – in defense, energy, mining, technology and more – that he says create jobs in the U.S. It also offers Prince Mohammed a chance to solidify ties with the U.S. as he races to transform the Saudi economy from oil dependency and create millions of jobs for young Saudis entering the workforce. \"It's no secret that Trump and his family have a lot of business interests and the Saudis and many around the world have seen that as an opening to deal with the Trump administration and have sought dividends through that mechanism,\" said Paul Salem, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, based in Beirut. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, he says Saudi Arabia has to be careful, like Israel and others, that it does not get too deep into U.S. partisan politics with relations swinging from one party to another \"because the U.S. is a very divided country today.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1060996322","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+08:00","title":"Philippines Establishes New Office of the Ombudsman to Strengthen Good Governance and Public Accountability","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Philippine government has taken significant steps toward enhancing transparency and accountability in public service delivery.

Of course, that's not for the lack of options available. There are countless tools and resources for money transfers or bill sharing, and very little resistance to incorporating Venmo or cash apps into our social lives. But those tools come into play  after  a group has decided on how to settle up. Despite how easy it is to pay for your share, the social nuances of deciding how the check will be split are not so easy to sort out. Some folks want to pay for themselves only. Other folks don't mind an even split to make the server's life a little easier. Others prefer the most chaotic option:  Oh, don't worry about it. You just get the next one. This is just one of many awkward situations that can arise among friends when it comes to wealth and privilege. Because deciding on who pays for the shared appetizer is more than a question of dollars and cents — it's a question of values and a marker of class. It's many social mores and socioeconomic forces all rolled up into one moment in time. So Life Kit   and  The Cut   have teamed up to shine a big ol' spotlight on this issue. I spoke with  Otegha Uwagba , author of  We Need to Talk About Money ,   to figure out what real-life tips and guidelines we can use to find some common ground with our peers without breaking the bank. Bring it up early and set boundaries Let's be honest. Oftentimes, we can sense that tricky conversations around money will arise at upcoming social gatherings. If this sounds like you and you're avoiding that elephant in the room, remember that it's important to make your boundaries clear and create a plan of action  before  accepting an invitation. You can say something like: This sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm keeping a close eye on my spending for the month. So I might order my meal separately from the group. Is that cool? Or: This sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm keeping a close eye on my spending for the month. So I might make dinner at home tonight, but I'll catch you next time! \n       \n      Related Story:  Good conversations take time and attention. Here's how to have better ones  \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  Accept The Awkwardness: How To Make Friends (And Keep Them) \n       This can feel really tough, understandably, because it forces you to be honest about your limitations and expose your vulnerabilities. But the alternatives are harder. Uwagba aptly points out that trying to keep up with your richer friends is an exercise in self-delusion. Eventually, you won't be able to do it anymore, and you'll have to come clean. So don't try to keep up with the Joneses' on this. Set the tone for what you are comfortable with as early as possible. Be transparent, neutral and supportive Remember, if your friendship with someone is important to you, chances are it is also important to your friend. So start conversations around this topic with an open mind and in good faith. It can actually be beneficial to your relationship. Uwagba points out that it can be helpful when both friends are forthright about their wealth and sources of additional financial supports. It was through down-to-earth conversations with her friends that she was able to contextualize her own success, she says. So encourage an environment with your trusted friends where they can feel comfortable being honest about their privilege or lack of it. Break the ice with something specific and neutral like ... I'm curious. How were you able to do so much vacationing and travel last year? What's your secret? Or: Hey, congrats on your new home! Buying a house sounds so stressful. What was your experience like? Being frank about privilege, especially wealth, is hard, but a good close friendship can survive frank conversations. In fact, they depend on them. And when in doubt, proceed with caution. \"I think you kind of just have to go slowly and see how receptive people are to what you're sharing,\" says Uwagba. \"What's their body language? Do they want to know more? Or are they sort of closed off and they don't seem engaged?\" Choose your company wisely So what if you're not so close to someone at the table or don't trust them to engage with you meaningfully? I'm sorry to say that there's no easy solution. But there is a simple one: Don't engage with them at all. Unfortunately, the root of societal tension around money is how divisive it can be. If you've made attempts at good faith conversations and boundary setting with friends but still feel awkward or uncomfortable with this topic, the best course of action may be to limit those friends in your life. \"If I feel like someone is kind of tone-deaf or insensitive or doesn't really appreciate their good fortune ... I have to say that over my 20s, I've kind of phased those friendships out, like not in a deliberate way, but just in terms of thinking who I want to spend my time around and who frustrates me to be around,\" says Uwagba. \n       \n      Related Story:  Friendships Change. Here's How To Deal  \n       Consider how much emotional labor you'd like to devote to your relationships. Does an acquaintance you see occasionally at parties merit the time it takes to have nuanced and trusting conversations? Or would it be easier to stick to small talk and keep it moving? These are tough questions to ask. But at the end of the day, only you can decide whether your friendship is worth the awkward back-and-forths — and disagreements — on economic values.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AGUILERA: There's a complicated dance we all do when it comes to friendships and money. Having friends means going out, doing activities together - in short, spending money. All of my friends are from different backgrounds and make different salaries and have different values when it comes to saving and spending money, so I still don't know what the proper etiquette is when the bill comes. I haven't yet mastered the dance. And to make matters worse, since I moved to New York City, a lot of these insecurities have been turbocharged because this city is home to some super rich people. It's all very confusing, made nearly incomprehensible because we just don't talk about this kind of thing - I mean, not really. And so for this episode of NPR's LIFE KIT, in collaboration with \"The Cut,\" I spoke with Otegha Uwagba, author of \"We Need To Talk About Money.\" She helps us figure out the best way to approach the sticky situations that come up around money and friendships. She's been thinking about money and friendships for quite a while. OTEGHA UWAGBA: I mean, I was working on this book for about three years before it came out, and money and having it or worrying about not having it is something that has really kind of dominated my life for various reasons. And certainly in my 20s, it's something that I gave a lot of thought to. AGUILERA: Otegha says there's a reason why it's so hard to talk about money with friends. UWAGBA: Money becomes shorthand for someone's value as person, and so it kind of isn't surprising that we find it difficult to talk about it openly, that we feel discomfort or shame. The amount of money you have invites judgment. AGUILERA: And she says money conversations can also serve as sort of a compass, pointing you in the direction of people you actually want to spend time with. UWAGBA: If I feel like someone is kind of tone-deaf or insensitive or doesn't really appreciate their good fortune, I have to say that over my 20s I've kind of fazed those friendships out - like, not in a deliberate way, but just in terms of thinking who I want to spend my time around and who frustrates me to be around. AGUILERA: We started out with the basics. When is it appropriate to talk about money with new friends? UWAGBA: I think what's appropriate to ask kind of depends on how close you are as a friend, you know, in the same way that I probably wouldn't ask a total stranger, you know, oh, how did you pay for your apartment? Who pays for your apartment? How did you get on the housing ladder? But if someone - you know, if a friend of yours mentions something that they're doing that requires money and you kind of can't add it up and you don't understand how it fits and OK, we've just bought a second home and that sort of thing, I think it's very appropriate to - just in quite a neutral way, just to say, oh, how have you made that happen? How have you afforded that? You know, I know it's expensive. Like, I think for me, it's about tone and delivery and asking in a nondefensive, nonjudgmental way. And that's what I've found is most effective. I think if people are going to talk about the kind of lifestyles that having money enables them, then I think it's kind of fair to expect that other people might potentially have questions. AGUILERA: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So in that case, what conversations about money should we be having with our friends, and what kind of boundaries should we set with them on the outset? Have you worked out any kind of strategies? UWAGBA: I think the main kind of conversations I have with my friends is kind of in a social context. Like, do you want to go to this restaurant? Do you want to go on a holiday? I mean, just last week, a friend said, hey, a couple of us are thinking of going to Mexico for New Year, and I just said I've had a really expensive year. I also had a really nice holiday over the summer, so I don't think I can afford this one. I'm going to sit it out. And she was totally understanding. And, you know, being honest about your limitations, both with your friends and with yourself - like, I think self-delusion is one of the, like, most expensive habits - trying to keep up with your friends or compete with friends who have more money than you do. And that's, like, kind of, like, on a day-to-day level. But on, like, a broader level, something that I didn't have in my 20s and that I felt quite embittered about and I write about in my book is that I wasn't having a lot of honest conversations with friends whose parents had given them, say, the money to put down a deposit on a flat or maybe were paying their rent. And I, for years, didn't understand how everybody else was going onto the housing ladder, and it just seemed completely impossible for me. AGUILERA: Been there. UWAGBA: Exactly. Like, I think a lot of people have been there. And it was only towards the tail end of my 20s that I found the sorts of friends who, A, were in a similar position to me and, B, were more willing to talk about that even if they had had help. If they said, you know, I've bought a place, they'd be like, yeah, my parents helped me. My parents gave me a deposit. My - and it was just that honesty that I was looking for. AGUILERA: Yeah. Transparency seems to be the way to go and just approaching the topic, trying to be as neutral about it as possible. But let's say that we're in the position of being the privileged ones, you and I, and we need to talk about - you know, with somebody who is not as privileged as we are. Where is the line between, you know, just being transparent about our financial situations and say, like, oh, you know, this turned out to be a very successful book, so now I'm able to do this, and where do you feel like it starts to get into bragging? Because that seems - I'm struggling with that a little bit with my friends back home. And I want them to be proud of me and happy for me, and I want them to know the details. I don't want to omit anything. But I also don't - I don't know where the line is. UWAGBA: That's an interesting question. I think you kind of just have to go slowly and see how receptive people are to what you're sharing. And, you know, is somebody asking questions about it? You know, if you say, OK, I signed this book deal and actually I got paid a decent chunk for it or I've made a decent chunk in royalties, you know, what's their body language? Do they want to know more or are they kind of closed off, and they don't seem engaged in it at all? And I think that can kind of tell you more about it. Like, I think if you are already conscious and worried about bragging, then I think it's highly unlikely that you are. Like, people who brag tend to just not be very self-aware. I have found, from being on both sides of the coin, is that it's incredibly sort of crass to fret about your money worries to a friend whose problems probably outstrip yours. So if you're telling them about these financial successes you've had, now is also not the time to complain about, oh, but so-and-so got more for their book deal or so-and-so, you know, got this cushy new job. I think that is what I find that people tend to get wrong, which is that they don't target, I guess, their complaints and their gripes and their issues at the right audience. So I'm like, go talk to your rich friends about that. Like, they will understand that - you know, why you're annoyed about that. Like, I think you really have to know your audience. But I - you know, I also don't think you should be embarrassed about financial success. But I think, again, it's just about being honest and honest about what it's allowed you to do and honest about what your limitations are, as well. AGUILERA: Yeah. And on the flip side there, let's say that's, like, a one-on-one conversation. Those are very deep conversations. But let's, like, step back to, like, a group of friends and, you know, the things that come up with us in money in groups of friends all the time - splitting checks at dinner. It's always going to be awkward. It's always weird. Nobody addresses it until the check comes. And it's always this, like, awkward, what are we doing? - kind of situation. And in my experience - and this is a very generalized experience - but rich people are kind of cheap (laughter). And I know this from being a waitress myself sometimes. So in a situation where you're in a group setting and somebody wants to split the check evenly, somebody wants to have everyone pay only what they ate, how do you navigate that? UWAGBA: I think it's helpful to be the person who looks out for other people in that situation, and that's kind of what I tend to do. So if I've gone for dinner with friends, and let's say one of my friends isn't drinking or doesn't drink - and obviously that tends to bump the bill up. Like, whether or not it relates to me and my spending, I do kind of tend to look out and say, oh, so-and-so, well, she didn't actually drink, so I think we should, like - she should pay less and that sort of thing. I think that can be a really good thing to do within your friendship circle because then you're kind of advocating for each other. Now when I go out for dinner or I go out for meals, I kind of go out and I'm like, OK, this is going to cost me, and I'm kind of prepared with that. And so I either opt in to the occasion as a whole or I opt out. So, like, I - because I think it can be really tricky to kind of navigate the bill-splitting situation. So I'm either like, OK, well, I'm going out for dinner and this is going to cost me or I can't really afford this at the moment, so I'm going to skip dinner. Maybe I'll meet them afterwards for drinks and just be quite honest about it. It's kind of a muscle, I think, kind of building up the ability to say, hey, this is slightly out of my budget. Do you mind go - do you mind if we go somewhere cheaper or do you mind if maybe one of us cooks at home? You know, I can host you guys at mine. And the more you do it, the easier it gets. And you often find that other people within your group are actually kind of grateful to you for doing that because, like, they also maybe don't want to spend money or they also are kind of feeling a bit strapped or, you know, they're just generally quite sympathetic. AGUILERA: Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm afraid to bring up money to my wealthier friends because I'm afraid that they're going to think that that is the reason I'm friends with them. Like, I can tell that that is, like, a No. 1 fear, is, like - one of my friends, for example, is deathly afraid that people are only friends with her because they, like, assume that she's going to hook it up constantly. And I end up spending more money than I want to just to make things simple when I hang out because I don't want to have that, like, tension hanging in there as, like, am I saying - you know, am I hanging out with you because I want to hang out with you or am I hanging out with - you know, it just - how do I stop that whole section of tension and without making it awkward? How do I convince - like, lay that foundation that I'm not friends with you because, you know, you can get me into these parties or you have this amount of wealth? UWAGBA: Well, I think you kind of have to suck up that it is going to be awkward when you kind of have the initial conversation that I'm going to advise that you have - like, an honest conversation and in, like, a neutral setting. It's not the next time you guys go out and you're at a really expensive restaurant or bar or whatever. But maybe if you're going for a walk or, like, she's over at yours and just saying, hey, you know, do you think we could - like, and kind of suggesting alternative of the things that you can do that are maybe a little bit more in your budget and just say that, like - just be really honest. Like, we are not in the same financial position, and I don't want our friendship to be kind of based around what we can do with each other that involves spending money. Like, I think one of the weird silver linings of the pandemic was I realized how much I could sustain certain friendships without spending money because we couldn't go out. We couldn't go anywhere. And so there were a lot of phone calls and a lot of walks in the park and, you know, when restrictions eased to an extent, a lot of, like, dinners at people's houses. And it made me realize how we'd kind of gotten into this cycle of thinking the only way we could socialize with each other was to go somewhere expensive - you know, service charge and get an Uber home. And actually, that was all periphery to our friendship. AGUILERA: Yeah. That's a great note, too, about the pandemic, like, stripping away all these, like, structures that we put ourselves into. What if you're a guest, like, and you go visit a friend? Is treating them appropriate or polite? UWAGBA: Oh, definitely. Let's say you go and stay with a friend. They put you up for a week or something. It's polite to buy a present on the final night that you guys go out. You take them out to a nice restaurant, and you pay. Like, that to me is just, like, social niceties and politeness. And in a way, I think those things - the need for those things kind of diminishes the longer you've been friends. I will just kind of turn up and, like, just flop on their sofa because it's like, we're kind of beyond the point of those social niceties. So it definitely does kind of depend on the nature of a friendship, but it's always nice to, like, offer a token of gratitude. And I think it's something that I always kind of try to do if I'm - if somebody has been generous with me. It doesn't have to be expensive. I think it's just the thought and the effort that counts. If staying with someone has saved you money - let's say it saved you - let's say you're going to visit a friend in a different country, and instead of having to pay for a hotel and Airbnb for a week, they let you stay in their place. Well, then you kind of have to think about it as, OK, well, I've saved, you know, a thousand dollars, so I can carve off a chunk of the thousand I've saved and maybe buy them, like, a really nice present. AGUILERA: Yeah. Yeah, I'm really glad that you mentioned that the need for those niceties diminishes as you get closer to someone because I definitely have that experience. UWAGBA: Yeah, I'm, I think, way less polite with my, like, very close friends than with people I don't know as well, which - I don't know what that says about me. AGUILERA: Yeah. What do you think the biggest takeaway that you have come away with about this whole topic since writing your book and since thinking about it in such a, you know, deep way? UWAGBA: I think one of the most toxic emotions around money can be shame. And I think that can be the thing that just, like, emotionally stops people from making progress in how they feel about money. I think one of the best ways to alleviate shame is having conversations with people in your life or conversations with therapists. I think we're really conditioned not to talk about money and not to admit to some of our more base instincts and some of our more negative emotions, whether it is jealousy or bitterness or resentment, all these things. And it kind of keeps us trapped, and it keeps us locked, and it stops you from really establishing a healthy relationship with money. So that is the main reason that I think that we need to talk about money because it absolutely can be transformative for how you feel about money.

the midterms loom as states wait for a Supreme Court ruling \n         By Hansi Lo Wang \n        \n           Tuesday, November 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In the congressional gerrymandering fight between Republicans and Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterm election, a number of states are keeping watch for a potential game changer from the U.S. Supreme Court. During the rare rehearing of a Louisiana redistricting case in October, the court's conservative majority  appeared inclined  to weaken the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process. Such a ruling could spark a new wave of congressional redistricting, especially in the South, where voting is often racially polarized and Section 2 has long prevented the dilution of Black minority voters' collective power. Without the current Section 2 protections, Republican-led southern states may undo districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates, who are usually Democrats. This redrawing  could give the GOP a sizable boost , as the party seeks to keep control of the House of Representatives. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When the Supreme Court would release its decision is crucial. Time is running out to redo maps, which have to be finalized ahead of a state's filing deadline for candidates seeking to run in a primary election for the midterms. \"The earlier the decision comes, the more likely the decision is before the date for candidates to declare that they're going to be running, and the more time there is for legislatures to meet and consider maps and redraw their maps,\" says Nick Stephanopoulos, a professor specializing in election law at Harvard Law School. The next batch of filing deadlines arrives in December. Still, Stephanopoulos notes these cut-off dates are \"just products of state law.\" \"If a state legislature that's hellbent on gerrymandering wants to do so, it wouldn't be especially surprising if that same legislature delayed the filing deadline, potentially even change the date of the primary election, in order to give themselves enough time to gerrymander,\" Stephanopoulos says. Last month, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature  shifted  the state's  election calendar , pushing its cutoff date for candidate declarations from January to February, and the spring primary from April to May. The change could take advantage of a possible earlier-than-usual decision from the Supreme Court, which typically releases major rulings in June. Louisiana  had asked  the justices for a decision in the state's redistricting case early next year, given the calendar crunch. In Alabama, which has a  January deadline ahead of a May primary election , a Republican state lawmaker is  proposing to allow  a special primary to be held by August if a change to a voting map is \"made at a time too late to be accommodated during the normal primary election schedule.\" There's no definitive list of districts protected by Section 2 Which other states may rush to respond to a weakening of redistricting requirements under the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is hard to predict, says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. To begin with, Li explains, there is no definitive list of Section 2 districts that could be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling because states usually don't explain their reasoning for drawing the boundaries of a voting district the way they do. To come up with a list, \"you'd have to go district by district and do a case-by-case assessment of whether there actually is Section 2 liability or not,\" Li says. And some states may start claiming a district was drawn to get in line with Section 2 even if the law would not have required an opportunity district for racial minority voters. \"It may just be an excuse to get rid of heavily minority districts even if there's not a legal obligation to do so,\" Li adds. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On the other hand, some Republican-led states may want to try to keep Section 2 districts that are Democratic-leaning in place. \"There are many places in the country where getting rid of Section 2 districts would make neighboring Republican districts much more competitive. And that may not be what Republicans want,\" Li says. \"It's more efficient for Republicans to have a heavily Black, and thus heavily Democratic, district to sop up as many of these high-turnout Black voters as possible.\" Another wild card amid the ongoing mid-decade gerrymandering fight is how Democratic-led states would react in a redistricting world without Section 2's current requirements. \"If blue states elsewhere observe Republicans massively gerrymandering, flipping 10 to 15 minority-opportunity districts and giving Republicans a big structural advantage in the battle for the U.S. House, I think there's going to be enormous pressure to respond to offset those gerrymanders in blue states,\" says Stephanopoulos at Harvard Law School. \"At this point, the only remaining way to do that is by weakening some of the districts that are now held by minority-preferred candidates in blue states.\" Edited by  Benjamin Swasey \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611168","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00-05:00","title":"DOJ Records Show Hundreds of Immigrants Arrested in Chicago Had No Criminal Records","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Department of Justice document reveals that 97% of the 614 immigrants arrested in Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz had no criminal record, directly contradicting the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the raids target 'the worst of the worst' violent criminals.

The document ,  submitted by the agency late last week as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in federal court, contains 614 names of immigrants arrested recently, most of them under the DHS's \"Operation Midway Blitz,\"  which launched in September . The government's own documents contradict the Trump administration's narrative that its ongoing raids are targeting and arresting violent criminals who are in the country illegally or are   what the agency routinely calls \"the worst of the worst.\" It also may violate a  2022 federal consent decree  that put strong conditions on making arrests without warrants or probable cause. Most of these arrests are likely to have violated these conditions, according to lawyers representing the migrants in the consent decree. \"You look at this list and it is very clear they just did a broad sweep of anybody and not a targeted sweep of people who were here unlawfully and that they knew were likely to flee or were criminals as they lead you to believe,\" said Michelle Garcia, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Illinois, one of the groups representing undocumented migrants in the consent decree. Of the 614 people on the list, 598 do not have criminal records. Only 16 — or 2.6%— have a criminal   record. Four of them have criminal convictions that include domestic battery, DUI, indecent exposure and kidnapping. One person was deemed a national security risk, another one was labeled a foreign criminal. No additional information on those two cases was provided. DHS regularly says that it  is taking murders and rapists off the streets . However, none of the people on this list was convicted or arrested for murder or rape. The list was first reported by the Chicago Tribune. Asked to respond to NPR's specific questions about how this list contradicts the government's claims that ongoing immigration sweeps across the country are targeting \"the worst of the worst\" criminals, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, \"Yes. It's basic math. There have been over 5,000 arrests\" in the Chicago area. \"70% of illegal aliens ICE arrested across the country have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S.,\" McLaughlin   wrote in an email. It's not clear where McLaughlin's arrest figure comes from since DHS has not released data on its arrests. The federal judge in Illinois overseeing this case, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, has extended the consent decree until early next year. This means that more and more undocumented immigrants who have been arrested recently could be eligible for release. Judge Cummings has also ordered the government   to provide by Nov. 19 the names and threat levels of the remaining approximately 3,200 people who have been arrested since June 11th. The Trump administration has appealed the judge's ruling. The attorneys for the migrants say their clients were simply swept up in Operation Midway Blitz. Those on the DOJ list are eligible to be temporarily released either on bond or with an ankle monitor or any other monitoring device while their cases continue. The vast majority of the people on this list pose a low or medium safety risk if released, according to the Justice Department. \"These are hardworking people who have families and ties to this country and are members of our community,\" ACLU attorney Garcia said. \"And we are doing everything possible to fight to have them remain with their families and their communities.\" The DOJ's list only includes names of people in detention as of October 22. According to the list, some of them have already been deported to their native countries or voluntarily removed. The Trump administration has recorded many of the operations, including one in the South Shore neighborhood where  masked federal agents rappelled from a helicopter onto a residential building . According to DHS, 37 people were arrested there, but only two of them were accused of having ties to gangs. The other 35 had entered the country illegally. Some had criminal charges. The surge in federal agents have also pushed community members to fight back. During the operation community members  responded with street protests  in downtown Chicago, and  volunteers regularly patrolled the streets alerting residents  of the presence of immigration agents. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Over the weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Department of Homeland Security launched its latest enforcement action targeting undocumented immigrants. DHS calls it Operation Charlotte's Web and says it's going after violent criminal immigrants. This is similar to a crackdown that DHS launched in Chicago in September. However, a recent court filing there shows that hundreds of immigrants arrested in Chicago have no criminal record. NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán has been following this and joins us now. Hi. SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: Sergio, tell us about this court filing in Chicago and its connection to this operation that DHS is calling Operation Midway Blitz. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah. So the Department of Justice late last week submitted a list that contained the names of 614 immigrants arrested recently in Chicago. These are arrests a federal judge says may have violated a 2022 federal consent decree, so this is part of an ongoing legal case. Now, that settlement puts strong conditions on making arrests without warrants or probable cause. The attorneys for these people say their clients were simply swept up in Operation Midway Blitz. This means they are eligible to be temporarily released, either on bond or with an ankle monitor or any other monitoring device, while their cases continue. SUMMERS: Now, the Trump administration says that the surge of federal agents in Chicago has had an impact - that it's decreased crime. Officials repeatedly say that they've taken the worst of the worst, as they say, immigrant criminals off the streets. Does the list submitted by the DOJ contradict that? MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: It does. Out of the 614 people on the list, 598 do not have a criminal record. That's 97% of the immigrants arrested. So per this document, Juana, most of the people in this sample have not committed a crime. Only 16 - or 2.6% - have a criminal history. Of those 16, four of them have criminal convictions. They range from domestic battery to DUI to indecent exposure and kidnapping. One person was labeled a national security risk. Another had a drug arrest. DHS, you know, regularly says that it is taking murderers and rapists off the streets. However, none of the people on this list was convicted or arrested for murder or rape. The list was first reported by the Chicago Tribune. NPR also has access to it. Now, I talked to Michelle Garcia. She's the deputy legal director of the ACLU of Illinois, one of the organizations representing the migrants in the federal consent decree. MICHELLE GARCIA: You look at this list and it is very clear that they just did a broad sweep of anybody and not a targeted sweep of people who were here unlawfully and that they knew were likely to flee or were criminals, as they lead you to believe. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: A DHS spokesperson did not reply to NPR's specific questions about how this list contradicts the government's narrative that they are targeting, quote, \"the worst of the worst\" of criminals. By the way, Juana, the vast majority of the people on this list pose a low or medium safety risk if released, according to the Justice Department. SUMMERS: Now, DHS has said that since Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago launched in September, more than 4,000 undocumented criminal immigrants have been arrested. But the list that you've been talking about, Sergio, it only includes 614 people. So what do we know, if anything, about the rest of those that were arrested there? MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: We are likely to learn more about that in the coming days. This list includes names of people in detention as of October 22. According to the list, some of them have already been deported or their - to their native countries or voluntarily removed. Now, the federal judge in Illinois overseeing this case, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, has extended the consent decree until early next year. This means that more and more undocumented immigrants who have been arrested could be eligible for release. Judge Cummings has also ordered the government to provide the names and threat levels of the remaining approximately 3,200 people who have been arrested since June 11, and the government has already appealed the judge's ruling. SUMMERS: NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, thank you. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611530","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"21:10:00-05:00","title":"Tennessee Judge Blocks Deployment of National Guard in Memphis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Tennessee judge, Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, blocked the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard in Memphis under a directive from President Donald Trump, citing violations of state law that require a local government request or a declaration of rebellion or invasion.

President Donald Trump but also put the order on hold, giving the government five days to appeal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal's decision sides with Democratic state and local officials who sued, contending that Republican Gov. Bill Lee cannot deploy the Tennessee National Guard for civil unrest unless there is rebellion or invasion, and even then, it would require action by state lawmakers. The plaintiffs also said another provision spells out a need for a request from a local government to use the Guard in some scenarios, including a \"breakdown of law and order,\" they said. The state has said Tennessee law gives the governor \"the authority to dispatch the Guard when needed and to determine when that need exists.\" In a statement posted on X, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, a plaintiff in the case, said he is pleased with the decision. \"The injunction does not take effect immediately, and the state has a chance to seek leave to appeal,\" he wrote. \"However, this is a positive step toward ensuring the rule of law applies to everyone, including everyday Tennesseans and even the Governor.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling neighborhoods and commercial areas of Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid in downtown, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say \"military police,\" with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power. The Guard  is part of a task force established by an order from Trump. It also involves a slew of other law enforcement agencies whose officers have patrolling the city now for weeks. For years, Memphis has dealt with high violent crime, including assaults, carjackings and homicides. While this year's statistics show improvement in several categories, including murders, many acknowledge that violence remains a problem. Trump announced in September that the National Guard would be deployed to combat crime in Memphis alongside authorities from a slew of federal agencies as part of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force. The task force, which includes hundreds of personnel attached to various federal and state law enforcement agencies and Memphis police, has made more than 2,500  arrests  since it began operating in Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Arrests have been made on charges ranging from drug and weapons violations to immigration warrants to homicides. Lee has said the National Guard would \"play a critical support role\" for local law enforcement. Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he never requested that the Guard come to his city. But after Trump made the announcement and Lee agreed, Young, who is not involved in the lawsuit, and others has said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders. Young has said operations include some 150 Guard members. Both the plaintiffs and the state acknowledged that the governor did not issue an order to trigger the deployment, but sent a news release. Lee has said that, \"As the the commander-in-chief, Gov. Lee has the authority to authorize the Title 32 strategic mission to Memphis.\" \"Every Memphian deserves to feel safe in their community, and through state, local, and federal partnerships, the Memphis Safe Task Force has created a generational opportunity that is already delivering remarkable results to enhance public safety,\" Lee's spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said after the lawsuit was filed. \"We are confident the court will uphold the Governor's constitutional authority.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5611457","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"How 'defund Planned Parenthood' came to threaten primary care in rural Maine","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In rural Maine, where 72% of residents support abortion access, a federal defunding law passed under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has severely disrupted access to reproductive health care.

5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Ashley Smith arrived to testify before the Maine Legislature during a committee hearing last spring, she was terrified. \"I was shaking like a leaf in the wind,\" she says. She told lawmakers that she was there in support of Maine Family Planning, a 50-year-old network of reproductive health clinics where Smith is a patient. State lawmakers were considering how to make up a funding shortfall from Washington, D.C. where Republicans in Congress aimed to cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion. Smith told the committee that she doesn't have health insurance and that Maine Family Planning's nonprofit clinics were her only source of health care. \"In the last four years I've received care there, not once did I have an abortion,\" Smith  testified . \"I did, however, have access to STD and STI (sexually transmitted disease and infection) testing, referrals for thyroid testing and blood panels, pap smears, breast examinations, referrals for mammograms, and a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis. The last two I listed saved my life,\" she said. Smith, who's 36, says she was inspired to testify and write  an op-ed , because she's worried about what would happen if Maine Family Planning had to close in the face of deep federal funding cuts. \"I can't imagine what would happen to our communities if we lost such a keystone — that's what really fueled my fire,\" she says. Maine Family Planning did get a year of additional funding from the state, but it also lost Medicaid revenue for one year with the passage of President Trump's tax and spending bill — a 20% hit to the organization's funding. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The \"defund\" effort beyond Planned Parenthood In Maine, abortion is legal and widely supported by the electorate. In a poll released by the Pew Research Center this summer,  72% of Mainers  say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The state legislature has moved to expand access to abortion care since the Supreme Court overturned  Roe v. Wade  three years ago. Now, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are using federal funding as a lever to restrict abortion access in states, like Maine, where it is legal and protected by state law. Republicans and anti-abortion rights activists have long sought to end Medicaid dollars flowing to Planned Parenthood for any reason, arguing that federal reimbursement even for unrelated services indirectly supports abortion in clinics that specialize in reproductive health. In July, they were finally able to accomplish that goal. The  provision in the law  blocks federal Medicaid funds from being paid to reproductive health nonprofits that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid payments in a year. It took effect when the bill was signed by President Trump on July 4. (Republican senators  changed the timeline  from a decade to a single year of defunding to comply with Senate rules.) Very few organizations fit the $800,000+ description. Planned Parenthood is one of them, another is  Health Imperatives in Massachusetts , and so is Maine Family Planning. \"Where am I going to go?\" About half of Maine Family Planning's patients are on Medicaid. The organization is no longer reimbursed for their visits. That's about $2 million gone, says George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO. \"That's difficult. You have to make some difficult decisions,\" he says. \"Either you generate more revenue, or you cut costs.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Oct. 1, the organization let patients know they would be  ending primary care  services at the end of the month at three clinics in the far reaches of the state: Houlton, Presque Isle and Ellsworth. That change affected nearly 1,000 patients, including patients on Medicaid and those with private insurance. \"The day that our portal message went out [to patients], the phones just started ringing off the hook,\" says clinical services director Melissa Gray. \"It was the same message over and over again: 'Where am I going to go? You folks have helped me with things that nobody else had helped me with, I never felt like you were judging me. I don't want a different provider, I want to keep seeing you.' \"It was really heartbreaking and a hard couple of days for staff,\" she says. Gray and her team spent all of October trying to connect those patients to new doctors, and making sure they were set up with enough refills of medications to last them when there were long waits before they could be seen by the new practice. Maine has a  health care provider shortage , which made that task harder, she says. \"There already weren't enough providers — we were getting new patient requests all the time,\" she says. \"Now there's less.\" The goal of scaling back primary care was to try to preserve family planning for longer. All 18 of their family planning clinics around the state are still open. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill. \"And our mission is to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\" They're still seeing Medicaid patients for sexual and reproductive health without getting paid for it. A stack of billing sheets, just in case One of their clinics is in Thomaston, Maine, a small town along the coast. Vanessa Shields-Haas is the nurse practitioner there. The clinic is bright and friendly, with colorful \"condom art\" on a bulletin board in the waiting room. Shields-Haas is infuriated by the funding cuts to Maine Family Planning and what they mean for her patients. \"A lot of my patients — maybe they're working at a hotel or they're waiting tables, they're serving lobster rolls to hungry tourists, starting oyster farms,\" she says. \"These are people that are working really hard.\" She does a lot for them: fertility treatments, biopsies, prescription refills, even vasectomies. And she's continued to do all those things for her patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed. \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says. \"I fill out the billing sheets and we stack them up in the event that we could be reimbursed possibly in the future.\" She says patients are confused by what's happening, and many have sent her messages asking if they can still go to her for care. She assures them that they can, although she worries about the future. \"Unfortunately, decision-makers in Washington are having such a profound impact on what we can and can't do,\" she says. \"Not being able to be reimbursed for the visits is really crippling, financially.\" A legal challenge For George Hill, political interference in sexual and reproductive health care is nothing new. \"I've been in the field since 1987, so close to 40 years, [through] several different presidential administrations that have been hostile to the care that we now provide,\" he says. \"This is — by volume and velocity — probably the worst that we have seen.\" Just weeks after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, Maine Family Planning  filed a lawsuit  to challenge the provision that blocks them from getting Medicaid funding. \"The lawsuit was filed essentially because Maine Family Planning says this is unfair and it's wrong and it's unconstitutional to be singling out and targeting certain providers based on this animus against abortion,\" says  Autumn Katz , interim director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the organization in its lawsuit. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The federal government  defended the provision  in a court filing, arguing that it promotes Congress' \"goal of reducing abortion\" and suggesting Maine Family Planning could get its funding back if it stopped providing abortion. (Planned Parenthood filed a separate lawsuit and was able  to secure an injunction . In Maine, the injunction request was denied and so the provision is in effect while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.) Another threat looms Anti-abortion efforts at the federal level may not stop with the Medicaid law. Another 20% of Maine Family Planning's budget comes from the federal government through  Title X  — a decades-old grant program that enables the clinics to see uninsured patients. In October, the Trump administration fired the whole team that works on that program. Those firings were reversed in mid-November as part of the deal to end the shutdown, but the administration could try to end the program in another way. Hill says he isn't sure what's going to happen next with the lawsuit and Medicaid, or Title X, but he says they're not giving up. The state law that patient Ashley Smith advocated for provides short term  funding from the state  to help fill the budget gap. Hill says they're exploring new potential partnerships and new ways to raise revenue they haven't tried before. He quotes Rep. Pat Schroeder, the late Democratic lawmaker from Colorado: \"You can't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you're wringing your hands,\" he says. \"We're going to continue to do the work. We're not going to stop.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   Right now, a network of medical clinics that provide abortion in Maine are staring down deep funding shortfalls because of a new federal law that cuts them out of Medicaid. This is in a state where, according to a recent report from the Pew Research Center, nearly 3 in 4 residents think abortion access should be legal in all or most circumstances. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has this report from Maine. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: It was winter 2020 - the first COVID winter - in Oxford, Maine. Ashley Smith got a phone call from an ex-partner. ASHLEY SMITH: Somebody that I haven't spoken to in a couple of months is like, oh, hey. Hate to reach out and tell you this, but... SIMMONS-DUFFIN: They'd tested positive for a sexually transmitted infection called chlamydia. SMITH: I just quickly did a Google search to see who was going to be in the area that I could just schedule an STI test, and that Google search led me to Maine Family Planning in Norway. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Which was very close by, and they got her in quickly. Smith works in restaurants as a server. She doesn't have health insurance, so she came ready to pay cash. But the test was free. SMITH: They made that process so easy and, like, so painless. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: From then on, that's where Smith went when she needed a doctor. Maine Family Planning has been around a long time - 50 years. They have 18 clinics all over the rural state, so there was still one nearby when she moved. She's gone there for pap smears, breast exams. She once went to get a physical to work at a summer camp. SMITH: I was like, I know that you guys offer primary care. Can you basically just take my weight and tell them that my blood pressure is OK? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She says, most importantly, they diagnosed a chronic condition for her - premenstrual dysphoric disorder. She says getting that treated has improved her quality of life dramatically. SMITH: It's night and day who I am. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Clearly, she is a fan of Maine Family Planning. So much so that the 36-year-old has turned into an advocate. In March, she fought off nerves to testify in the state legislature at a committee hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SMITH: I'm here because these nonprofit clinics are my only source of health care. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: The need for advocacy is because of recent actions by the federal government, and because in addition to cancer screenings and STI testing and all the rest, Maine Family Planning provides abortion care. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, 12 states banned abortion outright and more passed severe restrictions. States like Maine have moved in the other direction - to expand access. Now the Republican-led federal government is moving to restrict abortion access in states where it's legal and protected, using federal funding as its lever. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING) VANESSA SHIELDS-HAAS: Hey. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Hi. SHIELDS-HAAS: Come on in. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: To be specific, Medicaid funding is now unavailable to Maine Family Planning clinics for any services. Vanessa Shields-Haas is the nurse practitioner at the clinic in Thomaston, Maine, a small town along the coast. SHIELDS-HAAS: This is our larger exam room. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING) SHIELDS-HAAS: Here we do most of our yearly wellness visits. We do vulvar biopsies and vasectomies and intrauterine inseminations as well for people... SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Just like Ashley Smith, who needed a basic physical for her summer camp job, many of her reproductive health patients come in needing primary care too. Seventy percent of Maine Family Planning patients only see them as their doctor. SHIELDS-HAAS: I can treat your tick bite or your bronchitis. I tell people, if you cut your finger off or you're having a heart attack, I'm going to send you to the emergency room, but there's a lot of - many other things that can be treated here. And because... SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Clinics like this one were already prohibited from getting Medicaid reimbursement for abortion because of the Hyde Amendment which passed in the 1970s. What's new now is a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congressional Republicans passed this summer, which blocks several health care organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, from receiving any Medicaid funding for any services for one year. SHIELDS-HAAS: So since July 4, since the bill was passed, we haven't been reimbursed for visits for patients who use Medicaid as their insurance. And we've been seeing all of those patients for free. We haven't been turning them away. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: A lot of her patients do seasonal jobs. Half of Maine Family Planning's patients are on Medicaid. SHIELDS-HAAS: Maybe they're working at a hotel or they're waiting tables, they're serving lobster rolls to hungry tourists, starting oyster farms. These are entrepreneurs. These are people that are working really hard. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Shields-Haas tries to be there for them for whatever they need. She's acutely aware that there aren't enough doctors in this rural state. She calls the new law infuriating. SHIELDS-HAAS: Unfortunately, decision-makers in Washington are having such a profound impact on what we can and can't do. Not being able to be reimbursed for the visits is - it's really crippling financially. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: The person tasked with troubleshooting that problem is George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO. He works about an hour's drive away at the organization's headquarters in Augusta. GEORGE HILL: I've been in the field since 1987, so close to 40 years. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Over those years, many presidential administrations have been hostile to their work, he says. HILL: This is, by volume and velocity, probably the worst that we have seen. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit to challenge the law that blocks them from getting Medicaid funding. In its response to the suit, the federal government said the provision furthers Congress', quote, \"goal of reducing abortion,\" and suggested Maine Family Planning could stop providing abortions to get its funding back. For now, while that lawsuit works its way through the courts, Maine Family Planning cannot receive Medicaid funding. That's $2 million - 20% of their budget - gone. HILL: That's difficult. You have to make some difficult decisions. Either you generate more money, more revenue, or you cut costs. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: In the short term, they've had to cut some services. On November 1, Maine Family Planning ended primary care services at three clinics in the far reaches of the state. Staff helped nearly a thousand patients find new doctors. Hill hopes that decision will help preserve the rest of what they do. HILL: We have a mission, and our mission is to make sure that access to sexual and reproductive health care - the full range of sexual and reproductive health care - is available to as many patients as possible. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: They also received some additional funding from the state to help fill the gap, and he says they're exploring new ways to raise revenue. He quotes the late Democratic lawmaker Pat Schroeder. HILL: You can't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you're wringing your hands. We're going to keep doing what we're doing. We're not going to stop. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News, Augusta, Maine.

   Communities are reducing wildfire risk. Will their insurance bills go down? \n         By Lauren Sommer \n        \n           Sunday, November 16, 2025 • 7:48 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         In the rolling hills of Lake County, Calif., residents in Kelseyville are getting home makeovers. The improvements aren't eye-catching: new gutters on the roof, gravel around the exterior walls and wire mesh covering attic openings. Still, those mundane items can make a world of difference in a wildfire. The goal is to make the homes less likely to burn in wildfires that are becoming increasingly destructive. Most structures ignite because of  glowing, red embers  carried by the wind. Making one house ember-resistant is good, but making a whole neighborhood resistant is dramatically better, since fires spread from house to house. It's part of a new program being piloted in California, one that many residents in fire-ravaged Lake County appreciate all too well. In the last 10 years, 70% of the county has burned, according to local officials. It was the wake-up call that led officials to begin a broad range of projects to reduce fire risk and make homes insurable. The problem is getting insurance companies to notice. Across Lake County, insurance premiums are rising, and customers are being dropped. Insurance plan cancellations are  increasing faster there  than almost anywhere else in the country, according to a Senate Budget Committee report. It's part of a nationwide wave of non-renewals from insurance companies contending with increasingly expensive disasters, like wildfires, storms and hurricanes. Homeowners who make their houses more fire-resistant  are eligible for discounts  from insurance companies in California, often around 5-10%. But larger efforts by communities often aren't factored in by insurance companies, like the project to retrofit an entire neighborhood. Insurance industry experts say companies don't have a verified source of information about what's being done across a whole community. New efforts are underway to address that with a  wildfire data commons , a database that aggregates community projects so both insurance companies and communities can get a better view of what's being accomplished. Wildfire experts say insurance could be a critical motivator for spurring unprepared communities to take action. \"Communities want their hard work to be recognized,\" says Nancy Watkins, consulting actuary with Milliman, a risk analysis firm. \"As long as there's a disconnect between what people and communities do to reduce their risk and what they're experiencing from their insurance companies, there's this bias to do nothing. People think: nothing that I do will matter.\" Extreme makeover – wildfire edition For Penny Sidhu, her home makeover started with a tree. Its branches stretched from her house to her neighbor's, and she realized it was time to cut it down. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"You couldn't even see her roof,\" she says, pointing to her neighbor's house. \"it was like our houses were connected. There were huge trees and bushes.\" Sidhu lives alone and was worried about losing her home in a wildfire. She's had to evacuate three times in the last nine years, her adult children urging to leave every time a wildfire broke out. When Sidhu called a local government agency about the tree, she found out she was eligible for a new program that would address her whole house. Lake County is one of six counties in California that's developing home-retrofitting programs through the  California Wildfire Mitigation Program , created by a state law in 2019. The  Lake County Home Hardening  program is funded by the state, as well as a federal grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program provides a home inspection and contractors, covering up to $40,000 dollars of work. At Sidhu's house, the projects quickly added up. The vegetation in her side yard was removed, and the bark mulch directly next to her house was replaced with gravel. Her wooden gate is being replaced with a metal one. The gutters now have covers, which prevent flammable leaves from piling up. The vent openings in her attic also have a mesh covering, which prevents embers from being sucked into her house. \"More than 90% of homes catch on fire due to embers, not direct flame, so that is what we highly focus on,\" says Deanna Fernweh, Lake County Home Hardening program manager. \"When you harden your home, it makes that whole area safer. We call that a resiliency effect.\" The program is clustering the work in the Kelseyville neighborhood to produce that fortifying effect. Even if one home does everything it can to prevent wildfire, it may still be vulnerable if a neighbor doesn't. So far, more than 30 homes have been retrofitted, with plans to reach 350. Sidhu says when her kids visit now, they feel a lot better. \"I feel like I won the lottery,\" she says. \"I would never have been able to afford this. There's just no way I could do it, especially because I'm by myself. There's just no way.\" Growing insurance crisis The home retrofitting program is just one of several efforts underway in Lake County to reduce dangers from wildfires. After losing her home in the 2015 Valley Fire, Jessica Pyska was elected to the Lake County Board of Supervisors. While some California communities have seen one or two catastrophic wildfires, Lake County  has seen nine . She says the fires were an alarm bell for the county, which is much less wealthy than Bay Area counties to the south. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It was very overwhelming to look at what needed to be done,\" she says. \"How do we right the ship for California and the West with the climate changing? But we just started taking one little bite at a time.\" The county put together a  list of projects  and started looking for grants. They improved evacuation routes and worked with state and federal partners to clear flammable vegetation on land surrounding communities. At the same time, as more extreme wildfires broke out around California, insurance started becoming an increasing problem. Residents were seeing premiums rise or were being dropped by insurance companies, leaving only the state-run  FAIR plan  as an option. \"People are trying to do everything they possibly can to get their rates lower, but it's really not helping much,\" Pyska says. \"I know a lot of people that are just going without insurance right now.\" Under new California rules, homeowners  can get a discount on their insurance  if they retrofit their houses against wildfires. Still, for many, discounts around 5% or 10% aren't large enough to offset rising premiums and they're not guaranteed to keep their insurance in the future. The problems have spread to the real estate market, where securing affordable insurance has become a significant hurdle. Sandy Tucker, who owns NextHome In The Valley and is president-elect of the Lake County Association of Realtors, says when a client is interested in a house, her first call is to insurance companies. She says insurance quotes can dramatically change a buyer's budget, or in one deal, even made a mortgage out of reach. \"It was enough of a difference that they didn't qualify for the loan anymore because they were so close to the line,\" Tucker says. \"I have seen deals fall apart. When somebody gets a quote that says it's going to be $10,000, they really rethink whether they want to buy it or not.\" While Lake County will never be out of danger from wildfires, especially as they get more intense with rising temperatures, Pyska is hopeful their work will dramatically decrease the chances that residents will lose homes. Still, she says insurance companies don't seem to be factoring that into their decisions about premiums. \"How do we get to the point where the insurers are saying: there's a much lower risk here community-wide, we'll come back and we'll lower the rates – or maybe not raise the rates quite so much?\" Pyska asks. Creating a data commons Factoring in the efforts of a whole community starts with a data problem. While insurance companies have information about the properties they insure, as well as other factors like fire hydrants, evacuation routes and the larger landscape, they don't necessarily have data about entire neighborhoods. \"To really understand if the risk has been reduced, an insurance company would theoretically need information about what my neighbors have done,\" says Watkins, an actuary at Milliman. \"That's very difficult for an insurance company to know about or to verify.\" Watkins is trying to address that with fire experts by creating the  WUI Data Commons  (WUI stands for wildland-urban interface). The idea is to create a database that aggregates community wildfire projects. That could be vegetation management projects by state and federal agencies, as well as home level projects. Insurance companies could use the data to analyze where risk is being reduced and adjust their insurance decisions accordingly. Watkins says the project is still in development, but she's hoping it will be a public-private partnership so communities can also use the tool to analyze their risk. While several insurance companies are interested, she says there are a lot of issues to be ironed out, like protecting consumer privacy and data-sharing among competing companies. Still, there are no guarantees that better information will make insurance companies reduce their premiums. California's insurance commissioner recently allowed insurance companies to raise their prices, in exchange for offering more policies in areas at risk from wildfires. \"As long as we have inflation going up and labor costs and building materials, if those costs are going to keep going up and people are going to keep building more expensive buildings in climate-risk areas, and we're going to continue to have climate change, those are all going to escalate the cost,\" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. \"Mitigation helps offset that, but it's not going to reverse those prices.\" Still, as California puts more resources into wildfire-prevention projects, Watkins says it's vital that communities get credit for it to incentivize that work. \"It's in California's very best interest to make sure that the insurance industry is aware of it,\" Watkins says. \"Why make them trick-or-treat for data? When we've done all these things to reduce the risk, serve it up on a plate.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   California is no stranger to extreme weather. This weekend, the state was hit by a huge storm system, forcing evacuations. It's these type of weather events and wildfires in particular that are driving up the prices of home insurance. That's especially true in Northern California's Lake County, where many companies are just canceling policies. Now community leaders are working to reduce the risks from wildfires. But as Lauren Sommer from NPR's Climate Desk reports, many of the insurance companies aren't taking note. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Penny Sidhu is getting a home makeover, which she feels like she won out of the blue. PENNY SIDHU: I have no words. I'm just, like, shocked. SOMMER: But it's not a makeover you'd notice standing in her front yard in Kelseyville, California, surrounded by rolling hills. SIDHU: There's screens on top of the gutters. So now I have new gutters with screens on them so the debris can't get in. SOMMER: Sidhu's house has been made over to protect against wildfires. She's part of a new California program to make homes less likely to burn. After evacuating from fires three times in the last nine years, Sidhu got concerned about overgrown brush between her and her neighbor's house. SIDHU: You couldn't even see her roof. Like, it was like our houses were connected. There was huge trees and bushes. SOMMER: She found out she was eligible for the Lake County Home Hardening Program, which uses state and federal funding. Deanna Fernweh, the program manager, set up an inspection to look for vulnerabilities like those bushes. DEANNA FERNWEH: So if those were to combust, it would catch both of their roofs on fire. And so we removed all of the vegetation. SOMMER: It's about protecting the house from embers - tiny bits of burning debris carried by the wind far from a wildfire itself. FERNWEH: More than 90% of homes catch on fire due to embers, not direct flame. So that is what we highly focus on. SOMMER: Fernweh's team removed the bark mulch near the walls of Sidhu's house and put in gravel. She'll get a metal gate in her side yard instead of wood. SIDHU: I would never have been able to afford this. There's just no way I could do it. Especially I'm by myself. There's just no way. SOMMER: Many of Sidhu's neighbors are in the same boat. The county has a lot of lower-income households. But some have gotten wildfire improvements too because the state program is focused on this neighborhood. Wildfire risk goes way down when many homes participate together. Sidhu hopes that insurance companies will notice that. SIDHU: People are having such a hard time getting insurance on their houses right now. My daughter just bought a house in Crescent City, and it was a nightmare to get insurance. SOMMER: But there are no guarantees that companies will keep insuring Sidhu and her neighbors. JESSICA PYSKA: This insurance crisis is hitting everywhere. SOMMER: Jessica Pyska is on the Lake County Board of Supervisors. She says in the last decade, about 70% of Lake County has burned. She lost her own home in 2015. And insurance has become a huge problem. Some residents are seeing rates double or are being dropped by their insurance companies. PYSKA: I know a lot of people that are just going without insurance right now. SOMMER: Pyska says the county is trying to reduce the wildfire risk with a range of projects. They've improved evacuation routes. They worked with federal and state agencies to reduce flammable vegetation in the forests around them. And there's the home improvement program. PYSKA: People are trying to do everything that they possibly can to get their rates lower, but it's really not helping much. SOMMER: Some insurance companies are offering small discounts - 5- or 10% - for homeowners that make their houses safer, but companies don't have to consider the work a whole community does to reduce their risk. PYSKA: How do we get to the point where the insurers are saying, there's a much lower risk here community-wide - we'll come back, and we'll lower the rates or maybe not raise the rates quite so much. SOMMER: That problem comes down to information. Nancy Watkins is a consulting actuary with Milliman, a risk analysis firm. NANCY WATKINS: To really understand if the risk has been reduced, an insurance company would theoretically need information about what my neighbors had done. That's very difficult for an insurance company to know about or to verify. SOMMER: It's something Watkins is trying to change. She's helping start the Wildland Urban Interface Data Commons. It would aggregate all the community wildfire projects into a big database, one that insurance companies can use to see where the wildfire risk is getting better. She says there's a lot to figure out about how it will work, like protecting consumer privacy and getting insurance companies on board. But it could help those companies provide discounts where they don't right now. WATKINS: As long as there's a disconnect between what people and communities do to reduce their risk and what they're experiencing from their insurance companies, if that disconnect persists, there's this bias to do nothing. People think, nothing that I do will matter. SOMMER: Insurance is a key motivation, she says, for incentivizing fire-prone communities to prevent disasters.

We get it. Life is a juggling act — and it can be hard to carve out time and attention to finally start that creative side hustle, clean out the garage or keep writing that screenplay. Here are five helpful ways to improve your focus, from eliminating time-sucking distractions to purposefully letting your mind wander, so you can reach the finish line. For more tips,  listen to our podcast episode . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Take a deep breath   Reported by Malaka Gharib  Stress can cloud our ability to focus, says  Arryn Robbins , a cognitive psychologist at the University of Richmond who specializes in visual search. Think of your attention like a spotlight, she says. You can increase the size of the beam or shrink it down. When you're stressed, your attention narrows, Robbins says. It almost feels like tunnel vision. \"The fight-or-flight response kicks into gear, your heart beats a little faster, and you might get a little sweaty because you're anxious.\" So if something requires your full attention, \"take a breath and calm your body down,\" she says. \"It really is your body's response to that stress that's causing that restriction in attention.\"  Find out how to use your attention to find missing objects . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Allow your mind to wander  Reported by Stephanie O'Neill  If you are finding it hard to focus, take a break and allow your mind to wander into what's called the default mode network, says Dr. Srini Pillay, a psychiatrist and the author of   Tinker Dabble Doodle Try: Unlock the Power of the Unfocused Mind . This network of brain circuitry is where magic happens, Pillay says. It's the place where our minds find innovation and creativity and often make better decisions than the focused mind. Get yourself there with something called positive constructive daydreaming, he says. Try traveling with your mind to someplace enjoyable — maybe it's a stroll through an imaginary forest or sunbathing on a warm, sandy beach.  Pair your daydreaming with some form of low-key activity such as walking, knitting or gardening. Release your mind for about 20 minutes of this fun and watch what happens.

Eliminate distractions  Reported by Mayowa Aina  If you often find yourself wasting time on social media, and it's making you feel stressed and guilty, set some boundaries, says Sammy Nickalls, author of  Log Off: Self-Help for the Extremely Online . Try turning off push notifications and deleting social media apps from your phone to create natural obstacles to accessing them. If that's not enough, use screen timers or app blockers to make it even tougher to log back on.  Are you too online? Take the quiz here. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       4. Get an accountability buddy  Reported by Marielle Segarra  If you're struggling to read more or start an exercise routine, you might benefit from an accountability partner — someone who can help you reach your goals. Research has shown that people accomplish more when they buddy up.  A 2015 study  published in  JAMA Internal Medicin e found that couples were more likely to make healthy behavioral changes, such as working out more or cutting back on smoking, if their partner adopted healthy changes too.  Find out how to find an accountability buddy here . 5. Remember, your time is precious Reported by Andee Tagle  Think about all the people and things you consider most important — your friends, your interests, your hobbies. Then think about who and what you actually spend your time on. Are the lists the same? Are you using up all your brainpower at the office and checking out as soon as you get home to the kids? Do you keep putting off learning to play that new song because social media won't stop calling you? \"If you're just giving away the only precious thing you have, which is the time of your life,\" make sure you spend it wisely, says  Oliver Burkeman , author of  Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals .

Thanksgiving turkeys this year \n         By Lydia Calitri \n        \n           Monday, November 17, 2025 • 12:49 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Americans will likely face higher prices on items for their Thanksgiving dinners this year. Turkey, typically the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, will be one of the biggest sticker shocks for consumers. Wholesale prices for a turkey have jumped 40% from a year ago, according to the  Department of Agriculture . Outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and increased demand have contributed to these higher prices. Those opting for beef instead of turkey should also prepare to pay more. Beef prices are nearly 15% higher than they were last year, according to  data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Canned vegetables are  5% more expensive  compared to last year, due to higher packaging costs from the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration put in place earlier this year. President Trump announced Friday that he would be  rolling back tariffs  he imposed on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities, in an effort to combat high prices at grocery stores. David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, said those   rollbacks won't lower prices completely, as tariffs aren't the only cause of increasing prices. \"By removing the tariffs, what we're doing is we're slowing down the increase in the price of many of these goods,\" Ortega said. \"So while we may not see prices go down for the holidays, it helps in terms of moderating the price increases that we've been accustomed to at the grocery store.\" Some grocery items have seen some price decreases in time for the holiday season.

By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 5:27 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SAN DIEGO — The acting chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency left his job Monday after just six months, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest disruption in a year of mass staff departures, program cuts and policy upheaval at the agency charged with managing federal disaster response. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       David Richardson, who in his brief term remained largely out of public sight, is leaving the post after he faced a wave of criticism for his handling of the deadly Texas floods earlier this year. He replaced previous acting head Cameron Hamilton in May. DHS did not comment on the details of Richardson's departure, but a FEMA employee familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Richardson resigned. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the changes with the media. \"The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security extend their sincere appreciation to the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator, David Richardson, for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector,\" a DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press. The Washington Post first reported the news about Richardson's resignation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A former Marine Corps officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and also led the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office, Richardson had no previous emergency management experience when he assumed the role of \"senior official performing the duties of administrator\" in May. After replacing Hamilton, who was fired one day after telling a House appropriations committee that he did not think FEMA should be eliminated, Richardson vowed to help fulfill President Donald Trump's goal to push more disaster recovery responsibilities to the states and told FEMA employees he would \" run right over \" anyone who tried to obstruct that mission. But Richardson's leadership was questioned by members of Congress and FEMA employees, particularly after remaining largely out of sight after the deadly Texas floods last July that killed at least 136 people. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When asked by a House committee in July why he did not arrive on the ground until one week after the disaster, Richardson said he stayed in Washington, D.C., to \"kick down the doors of bureaucracy,\" but also said he was camping with his sons for the July 4 weekend when the floods first hit and initially helped manage the response from inside his truck. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also kept a tight grip on FEMA programs and spending, requiring that she personally approve any agency expenditure over $100,000. Richardson had denied reports that the approval policy slowed down FEMA's response in Texas. FEMA Chief of Staff and former cybersecurity official Karen Evans will assume the role on Dec. 1, according to DHS. The FEMA administrator is required by law to have emergency management experience, but the Trump administration has circumvented those requirements up to now by appointing temporary leaders. The agency has undergone major upheaval since Trump returned to office in January promising to vastly overhaul if not eliminate the agency. About 18% of the agency's permanent full-time employees had departed as of June, including 24 senior-level staffers, according to the Government Accountability Office. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration also has slashed mitigation funding, placed requirements on preparedness grants that compel recipients to comply with Trump's immigration agenda, and denied several states' requests for major disaster declaration requests. DHS did not respond to questions about whether Richardson will still lead the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. Trump appointed a 12-member review council led by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deliver recommendations on how to reform FEMA and push more responsibility to the states for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. The council is expected to deliver its recommendations in December. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-sexual-battery-investigation-c74be04df1c5bd5cc4f1fc7574e5655f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:17:11+00:00","title":"Los Angeles Sheriff Investigates New Sexual Battery Allegations Against Sean 'Diddy' Combs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a prominent hip-hop mogul serving a four-year prison sentence for prostitution-related convictions, is now facing a new investigation into sexual battery allegations.

2025-11-17T11:31:20+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data — a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump . Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, and the advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period. Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation’s president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too. “There’s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they’re falling behind,” Margetta Morgan said. Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity , and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.

The president spoke about the economy and affordability issues Monday at an event hosted by the McDonald’s fast food company. “We have it almost at the sweet spot and prices are coming down on different things,” Trump said at the event, adding that inflation has been “normalized” at a “low level.” Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue , Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year’s midterm elections. Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills — meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills. The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration’s reputation. “In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,” Trump posted on social media Friday. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems.” Nearly 6 million households have utility debt “so severe” that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation’s analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel. During Trump’s first six months in office, there was a 3.8% increase in households with severely overdue utility bills. “Voters are frustrated and families are hurting because these tech giants are cutting backroom deals with politicians, and it’s causing their power bills to go up,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers. “If the Trump administration doesn’t want to do its job and protect families and make life more affordable, I guess that’s its choice.” Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau. The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy. “Electricity prices are a state problem,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. “There are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.” The new analysis of utility bills by the groups counters that the Trump administration is contributing to higher utility costs “by impeding renewable energy generation” including solar and wind power. While that analysis is a warning sign, other economic analyses on consumers suggest their finances are stable despite some emerging pressures. The New York Federal Reserve has said delinquency rates of 90 days or more for mortgages, auto loans and student debt have each increased over the past 12 months, though it said mortgage delinquencies are “relatively low.” An analysis of debit and credit card spending by the Bank of America Institute showed that consumers’ “overall financial health looks sound.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-98183","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:57:00-05:00","title":"U.N.

Security Council approves a U.S. plan for a Gaza stabilization force \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 17, 2025 • 8:57 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         UNITED NATIONS — The Trump administration's blueprint to secure and govern Gaza won strong approval at the United Nations on Monday, a crucial step that provides international support for U.S. efforts to move the devastated territory toward peace following two years of war. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The U.S. resolution that passed the U.N. Security Council authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in Gaza, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" Trump posted on social media. The vote endorses Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan and builds on the momentum of the fragile ceasefire he helped broker with allies. It marks a key next step for American efforts to outline Gaza's future after the Israel-Hamas war destroyed much of the territory and killed tens of thousands of people. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The proposal calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Trump would head. It also provides a wide mandate for the international stabilization force, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expire at the end of 2027. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that U.N. authorization was essential for their participation. Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote after fears Moscow might use its veto in the Security Council. However, Hamas opposed the resolution, saying in a statement that it does not meet the \"Palestinian people's political and humanitarian demands and rights.\" Stronger language on Palestinian state helps get the U.S. plan over the finish line U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz said the resolution \"represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security.\" It came about following nearly two weeks of negotiations, when Arab nations and the Palestinians pressed the United States to strengthen language about Palestinian self-determination. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the proposal still gives no timeline or guarantee for an independent state, only saying it's possible after advances in the reconstruction of Gaza and reforms of the Palestinian Authority, which now governs parts of the West Bank. The U.S. revised the resolution to say that after those steps, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\" \"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and repeated that position Sunday at a time when his hard-line governing partners have expressed concern about the resolution's endorsement of a \"pathway\" to Palestinian independence. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters before the vote that Israel was grateful to Trump \"for leading peace to the Middle East.\" Algeria's U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, thanked Trump for his instrumental role in bringing about the ceasefire, but said \"genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinian people.\" A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and other Muslim nations that had been critical to the ceasefire and potentially could contribute to the international force. The U.S. mission to the United Nations distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow took note of that support but abstained because the resolution did not include a role for the Security Council or emphatically support Palestinian statehood. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas' surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's offensive has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. What else the U.S. proposal says Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with \"many more exciting announcements.\" The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question has been how to disarm Hamas, which said Monday that giving the force a role inside Gaza that includes disarmament \"strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The resolution authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force. It says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel. As the international force establishes control, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\" These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-palestinians-hostages-investigation-11-17-2025-88673d6966d8ce25ad57b4f73a87b2cb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"13:08:11+00:00","title":"Israeli Settler Violence in West Bank Spikes Amid Political and Diplomatic Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant escalation of violence, Israeli settlers carried out a violent attack in the Palestinian village of al-Jab’a in the West Bank, torching homes and vehicles, amid a broader surge in settler attacks linked to the annual olive harvest.

The violence drew a rare condemnation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top leaders. Israel’s military said soldiers and police were sent to al-Jab’a, a small village southwest of Bethlehem, after reports of fires and vandalism. The attack came hours after clashes between Israeli security forces and settlers defending an unauthorized outpost on a nearby hill facing evacuation and demolition on Monday, according to COGAT, the Israeli military body that deals with civilians in the West Bank. Israeli police said earlier that six suspects were arrested in confrontations during the demolitions, where dozens of Israeli settlers were entrenched and hundreds rioted, throwing stones and metal bars and burning tires. The Monday night attack in al-Jab’a was the latest in a growing wave of settler violence to hit West Bank villages, which has surged this fall as Palestinians take part in their annual olive harvest. Violence carried out by settlers and Palestinian militants have both spiked as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in the occupied West Bank since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war . Related Stories Takeaways from AP’s report on a surge in Palestinian deaths in Israeli custody 4 MIN READ Most of Gaza’s schools are destroyed and hundreds of thousands of children cannot go back to class 4 MIN READ The German government says it’s lifting restrictions on exports of military equipment to Israel 1 MIN READ The U.N. Humanitarian office reported that October saw the highest number of Israeli settler attacks since tracking began with more than 260 incidents causing injuries or property damage. That’s on top of 2,660 settler attacks documented this year through the end of September. Six hundred ninety Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killed this year during the uptick in violence across the territory. ‘A handful of extremists’ Netanyahu called the settlers “a handful of extremists” and urged law enforcement to pursue them for “the attempt to take the law into their own hands.” “I intend to deal with this personally, and convene the relevant ministers as soon as possible to provide a response to this serious phenomenon,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu’s denunciation came at the outset of a busy week of diplomacy for Israel and after U.S. officials warned violence in the West Bank could undermine the month-old ceasefire in Gaza. Yet despite the violence, it appeared to be advancing. The U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. plan for Gaza authorizing an international force to provide security and envisioning a possible path to an independent Palestinian state. The vote was a crucial next step in U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire plan. Israeli leaders did not comment on the resolution but Netanyahu has previously voiced staunch opposition to moves toward establishing a Palestinian state and has long asserted doing so would reward Hamas. Netanyahu’s remarks against settler violence also come ahead of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s arrival in Washington. Trump is expected to lobby him to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords . But the crown prince has insisted he will not take that step without a viable path to statehood for Palestinians. Formal ties with Saudi Arabia would be a major victory for the embattled prime minister, who on Sunday approved the establishment of a government committee to investigate the security failures that allowed Hamas-led militants to storm southern Israel and kill around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu moves to shape inquiry The prime minister’s announcement of the committee angered many in Israel who responded with concerns about its makeup. The Oct. 7 committee approved by Netanyahu’s Cabinet differs from the kind of judge-led independent commission that Israel has convened in the past. Netanyahu, who previously resisted calls for an investigation, will oversee the makeup of the team governing the inquiry, in effect putting him in charge of the probe. In Sunday’s decision, he said the ceasefire that went into effect on Oct. 10 allows the government to start the investigation. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, called the decision insulting to the victims of Oct. 7 and to the hundreds of soldiers who have died in the war. “The government is doing everything it can to run from the truth and evade responsibility,” Lapid said. Survey data based on 1,000 respondents published by the Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute last month suggested nearly three-quarters of the public support a fully independent commission of inquiry. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, which is critical of Netanyahu, said, “This is not an investigative commission, this is a cover-up commission.” More details about the inquiry are to be announced in 45 days. The Israeli military and other security bodies have conducted a number of investigations into their failures on Oct. 7. But the committee will also look at governmental decision-making and assumptions that created the conditions for the attack to occur. In Gaza, flooding compounds woes Flooding has added yet another layer to the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza. The U.N. humanitarian office said 13,000 families were affected by the rain that began late last week. Abdallah Abu Quta, displaced to a tent with his family, called the suffering indescribable. “All night, we and the children were awake, shivering from the cold. We made a channel in the ground to drain the water out,” he said on Sunday. Israel sweeping military offensive has throughout the war killed more than 69,000 Palestinians in the coastal enclave, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. The war, which began with Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies. ___ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

surrounded by rubble and debris, a wasteland that is a common sight across the Gaza Strip . The tiny encampment was yet another makeshift school that has no room for her teenage son Kareem. “Most of the schools are destroyed,” she told The Associated Press. “Every school I go to tells me there is no room.” More than 600,000 Palestinian children in Gaza have missed the past two years of school because of the war between Israel and the militant Hamas group . Instead of studying and socializing, they have been repeatedly displaced, fled airstrikes and shelling and often spent their days scouring for water and food for their families. With a ceasefire reached last month largely holding, humanitarian officials are now working frantically to reopen dozens of makeshift schools. John Crickx, a spokesman for the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, said it’s critical for children to return to classes as soon as possible, not just because of basic education but also for their mental health. “In the weeks to come, if we don’t offer education,” he said, there could be “terrible consequences for an entire generation.” Related Stories 1 Israeli killed and 3 wounded in West Bank attack 4 MIN READ Zelenskyy, US envoy will visit Turkey in a new bid to end the Russia-Ukraine war 3 MIN READ PHOTO ESSAY: Portraits of workers keeping Ukraine out of the dark 4 MIN READ UNICEF estimates that over 630,000 Palestinian children missed out on school during the war. Crickx says that so far, only about 100,000 children have been able to return. Separately, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, is providing some education through their contracted teachers — for about 40,000 students. Most of the UNRWA-run schools, which catered to half of the Gaza children before the war, have since turned into shelters for displaced people. No space for tents Lack of space is a key obstacle: Dozens of schools were badly damaged or completely destroyed. Many are still being used as shelters for Palestinians who have been repeatedly displaced during the enclave’s intense bombardment. “It’s basically tents among the displaced people’s tents or it is some prefabs or shelters, said Crickx. “It’s very much ... the most basic learning.” At one school — a cluster of tents with the UNICEF logo erected on a patch of land amid bombed-out buildings in the southern city of Khan Younis — children huddled closely in one classroom, eagerly listening to their teacher. Crickx said that finding a location to put up the tents has been tricky. Another challenge is getting supplies into Gaza, whether concrete to fix damaged schools or simple pencils, erasers and other basic supplies. Since the Oct. 7, 2023 start of the war with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, these items have not been allowed into Gaza. Israel, which controls the flow of goods into the territory, considers them “non-critical, non-life saving,” Crickx said. COGAT, the Israeli military body that coordinates aid to Gaza, had no immediate comment on allowing in school supplies to Gaza. Even the children who return to makeshift schools were able to enroll carry the psychological burdens that come with war and displacement. “The level of trauma among the people of Gaza, including children, is horrific,” said UNRWA communications director Juliette Touma. U.N. agencies say they are struggling to asses the damages and figure out the costs — with the ceasefire still in its early stages, reconstruction of Gaza has not yet begun and U.N. experts say the process could take years and cost some $70 billion. Schools that turned into shelters Displaced families continue to live in the ruins of damaged schools. UNRWA’s Touma says about 75,000 people still shelter in the agency’s schools. One of the displaced, Tahreer al-Oweini says she feels guilty but that she had no choice. “I live in a classroom that should be in session with a teacher, students, and a blackboard,” said al-Oweini. Around her, damaged walls and ceilings are covered with tarp. Al-Oweini said she is struggling to secure spots for her three daughters and a son who are in elementary and middle school. She even told one school principal that she will search for a chair and desk for her daughter but was still rejected. “The children forgot everything they learned,” she said. “Their life over the past two years has been getting water, running after aid vehicles, war, Hamas, shelling, destruction.” “They have lived in fear or horror,” she added. Even during the most intense fighting, there have been some efforts in displacement camps and communities to keep children from falling behind in school, even as everyone struggled with bombardment, power cuts, and shortages of food, water, and medicine. But lessons were sporadic, and some families say they kept their children close and couldn’t risk letting them attend classes, fearing for their lives. It’s a race against time and UNRWA’s Touma warns of a “lost generation” — the longer the children stay out of school, the tougher it will be to someday catch up with their peers elsewhere. Touma is worried that if children miss out on education, the more likely they are to fall “prey to exploitation, including child marriage, child labor, and recruitment into armed groups.” Al-Oweini, like other families desperate to get their children back to school, is still hopeful. “I want my children to be like their father who finished university,” she said, adding that her daughters want to become doctors or engineers. “They have ambition,” she said. “But if they don’t go to school, they will have no future.” ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

impoverished countries at Monday’s United Nations climate talks to implore the rest of the world to stop talking and start acting. Their message: Our lives are on the line. As high-level ministers from governments around the world took over negotiations at the conference called COP30 , vulnerable nations lined up to say how important it is for countries to cut emissions. They said the world’s current climate plans aren’t strong enough to keep warming below the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set by the 2015 Paris Agreement . In addition, they renewed a longstanding call for rich nations to do more financially to help poor countries deal with warming. “Hurricane Melissa changed the life of every Jamaican in less than 24 hours,” said Matthew Samuda, the country’s economic growth minister. The Category 5 hurricane that hit three weeks ago caused almost $10 billion in damage and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. He called it evidence of “the new phase of climate change.” Matthew Samuda, minister of economic growth and job creation of Jamaica, speaks during a plenary session at the COP30 U.N.

Speakers lament slow progress Other nations reiterated the life-or-death nature of stepping up the fight to cut emissions, calling it “a moral duty” and saying climate damage is their day-to-day reality. “I sit on the roof of the house all night, looking at the neighbors, thinking whether or not the water will swallow us all,” Romanian Environment Minister Diana-Anda Buzoianu said, reading the words of a victim of this year’s floods in her country. “Promises alone will not hold back the rising seas,” Seychelles Environment and Climate Minister Flavien Philomel Joubert said. A ruling earlier this year by the International Court of Justice that climate change is a planetary existential problem that must be fixed is “leverage” that small island countries will use to speed up climate-fighting efforts at COP30, said Tuvalu Attorney-General Laingane Italeli Talia.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More That ruling shows that “the 1.5 target is not just a political aspiration, but a legal obligation informed by the best available science,” Tuvalu Environment and Climate Minister Maina Vakafua Talia said as thunder from a passing storm reverberated through the hall. “We are seeing the 1.5 target disappear before our eyes,” Talia said, adding that for small islands “it is the line between our survival and loss.” But stronger climate plans and saving 1.5 is important for the whole world, not just small islands, he added. COP30, more heavily fortified after a pair of demonstrations disrupted the main venue in the first week, kicked off its second week with foreign and other ministers stepping in for the lower-level negotiators who handled it earlier. They have far more power and leeway to make tough political decisions, and U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told them to use it. “The spirit is there, but the speed is not,” Stiell said. “The pace of change in the real economy has not been matched by the pace of progress in these negotiating rooms. As climate disasters wrecked millions of lives and hammer every economy, pushing up prices for food and other basic needs, we all know what’s at stake.” Other speakers also urged quicker action. “The time for promises is over,” Brazil Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said. “Each additional fraction of a degree of global warming represents lives at risk, greater inequality and greater losses for those who contributed least to the problem.” U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said recent disasters show how much needs to be done. “The climate crisis is unrelenting,” she said. “We saw this when Hurricane Melissa barreled into the Caribbean two weeks ago. We saw it again last week at the Philippines ... near back-to-back typhoons.” ‘Our existence is at stake’ Adding to the pressure, late Sunday the Brazilian presidency of the talks issued a five-page summary on how to proceed on several sticky issues. Those include pressing nations to do more in their new emissions-cutting plans, handling of trade disputes and barriers involving climate and the need to deliver on last year’s $300 billion annual pledge for climate financial aid to poor nations. Those difficult issues weren’t part of the original agenda nor the COP30 presidency’s plans, but several countries pushed for them.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Several countries — especially small island nations — have asked that the talks address the inadequacy of the emissions-cutting plans submitted by 116 nations so far this year. Collectively, the plans come nowhere close to cutting heat-trapping gases enough to prevent breeching the 1.5-degrees Celsius warming limit since the 1800s. That issue may get combined with a call for a plan for phasing out fossil fuels — coal, oil and natural gas, the chief cause of climate change. That phaseout was agreed to after much debate at U.N. climate talks two years ago, but last year, little happened on the issue. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva earlier this month raised the issue anew. “Our very existence is at stake,” Mauritius Foreign Affairs Minister Dhananjay Ramful said. “A decade after the promises of the Paris Agreement, despite our good intentions, we realized that we have not done enough. ...

America is more optimistic about what’s ahead for the U.S., according to a new survey from the American Communities Project. And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities , residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago. Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities. These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities. The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs. “Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.” Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country’s trajectory — even though most aren’t seeing Trump’s promised economic revival. The $15 price tag on a variety pack of Halloween candy at the Kroger supermarket last month struck Carl Gruber. Disabled and receiving federal food aid, the 42-year-old from Newark, Ohio, had hardly been oblivious to lingering, high supermarket prices. But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation’s future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests. “Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we’ll start to see prices come down.” About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark’s classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country’s future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism. Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.” But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said.

Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas’ booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what’s next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump’s effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable. A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities. Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3% , up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty. Engel’s less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It’s not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It’s a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it’s very, very hard.” Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime.

That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America’s Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023. For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump’s claims don’t ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people. “I don’t want to say it’s overblown, because crime is a serious subject,” Gamboa said. “But I feel like there’s an agenda to scare Americans, and it’s so unnecessary.” Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities. Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America. Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work. Not anymore, he said. “Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,” Gamboa said. “They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that’s all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.” Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected. Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.” The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn’t alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year. “It’s not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration’s aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants.

Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024. Maldonado worries that the Trump administration’s policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child’s lifetime and beyond. “My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.” ___ Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington. ___ The American Communities Project/Ipsos Fragmentation Study of 5,489 American adults aged 18 or older was conducted from Aug. 18 - Sept. 4, 2025, using the Ipsos probability-based online panel and RDD telephone interviews.

The U.S. resolution that passed the U.N. Security Council authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in Gaza, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. “This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!” Trump posted on social media. The vote endorses Trump’s 20-point ceasefire plan and builds on the momentum of the fragile ceasefire he helped broker with allies. It marks a key next step for American efforts to outline Gaza’s future after the Israel-Hamas war destroyed much of the territory and killed tens of thousands of people. The proposal calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Trump would head. It also provides a wide mandate for the international stabilization force, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expire at the end of 2027.

Mike Waltz said the resolution “represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security.” It came about following nearly two weeks of negotiations , when Arab nations and the Palestinians pressed the United States to strengthen language about Palestinian self-determination. But the proposal still gives no timeline or guarantee for an independent state, only saying it’s possible after advances in the reconstruction of Gaza and reforms of the Palestinian Authority, which now governs parts of the West Bank.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The U.S. revised the resolution to say that after those steps, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it adds. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and repeated that position Sunday at a time when his hard-line governing partners have expressed concern about the resolution’s endorsement of a “pathway” to Palestinian independence. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters before the vote that Israel was grateful to Trump “for leading peace to the Middle East.” Algeria’s U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama, the Arab representative on the council, thanked Trump for his instrumental role in bringing about the ceasefire, but said “genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinian people.” A key to the resolution’s adoption was support from Arab and other Muslim nations that had been critical to the ceasefire and potentially could contribute to the international force. The U.S. mission to the United Nations distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for “swift adoption” of the U.S. proposal. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow took note of that support but abstained because the resolution did not include a role for the Security Council or emphatically support Palestinian statehood. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza’s fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas’ surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. What else the US proposal says Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with “many more exciting announcements.” The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure “the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip” and “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” A big question has been how to disarm Hamas, which said Monday that giving the force a role inside Gaza that includes disarmament “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” The resolution authorizes the force “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate” in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.

Monday he will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia despite some concern within the administration that such a sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system. The announcement came on the eve of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s highly anticipated Washington visit, his first to the United States in more than seven years. “I will say that that we will be doing that,” Trump said when asked if he would sell the jets to Saudi Arabia. “We’ll be selling F-35s.” The sale of the fighter jets is one of several major deals between the two countries expected to be announced during the visit. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce a multibillion-dollar investment in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, and the two countries are will lay out details about new cooperation in the civil nuclear energy sector, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly ahead of the formal announcement. The crown prince had been expected to arrive with a wish list that includes receiving formal assurances from Trump defining the scope of the U.S. military protection for the kingdom and an agreement to buy U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, one of the world’s most advanced aircraft.

Another long-standing concern, which also derailed a potential similar sale to the United Arab Emirates, is that the F-35 technology could be stolen by or somehow transferred to China, which has close ties to both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, according to three administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations on the matter. The Saudis and China last month held joint naval exercises hosted by the kingdom. And Beijing in 2023 helped mediate an agreement between the Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen their embassies and exchange ambassadors amid ongoing tensions. China surpassed the U.S. last year as Saudi Arabia’s top trade partner, but the United States has remained Riyadh’s favored nation for arms sales. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Congress could press the administration to detail what assurances Riyadh has given the White House about its relationship with China. Questions about Israel He added that the White House is likely to also face questions about plans to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. The announcement by Trump comes at a moment in which he’s trying to persuade Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations. He has talked up his push to extend his first-term Abraham Accords — the project that formalized commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and a trio of Arab nations — as key to his plan for bringing long-term stability to the Middle East as the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to hold. “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords very shortly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday as he made his way to Florida for the weekend. Yet Trump’s optimism that a U.S.-brokered deal could come soon is tempered by more sober internal assessments. The Saudis have made clear that a guaranteed path to a Palestinian state remains a condition for the kingdom signing onto the accords — something Israel vehemently opposes. The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. Still, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to sign on to the accords anytime soon, but there is cautious optimism that an agreement can be sealed by the end of Trump’s second term, the officials said. “Let’s hope that President Trump makes clear that the first F-35 will not be delivered until Saudi Arabia normalizes relations with Israel,” Bowman said. “Otherwise, the president will undercut his own leverage.” The Trump administration formally notified Congress in November 2020 that it planned to sell 50 stealth F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates as part of a broader arms deal worth $23 billion aimed at deterring potential threats from Iran, despite concerns raised by Israel. The UAE announcement came shortly after Trump lost the 2020 election to Democratic Joe Biden and followed the signing of the Abraham Accords between and the UAE. But Biden, soon after taking office in January 2021, put a hold on that sale. Human rights issues Trump’s move is likely to receive scrutiny from human rights activists as Prince Mohammed’s trip marks his first visit to Washington since 2018. On that visit, the crown prince went on a three-week U.S. tour aimed at improving the perception of his nation in the eyes of Americans concerned by the kingdom’s conservative social mores, its unequal treatment of women and the ignominious fact that 15 of 19 hijackers that took part in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States were Saudi citizens. The Saudis’ reputation was further eroded months after Prince Mohammed’s last Washington visit with the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, an operation targeting a critic of the kingdom that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed. The crown prince has denied he was involved. But seven years later, the dark clouds in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have been cleared away by Trump, who has tightened his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. “They have been a great ally,” Trump said. —- AP Diplomatic writer Matthew Lee contributed reporting."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-arrests-federal-agents-trump-0e143aa0161c998997e33fc1f52656d9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-16","timeOfPublication":"18:12:19+00:00","title":"Federal Immigration Enforcement Surge in Charlotte Sparks Widespread Fear and Protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal immigration enforcement surge, dubbed 'Operation Charlotte’s Web,' targeted Charlotte, North Carolina, with hundreds of arrests conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in churches, apartment complexes, and stores.

touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina’s largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores. The Trump administration has made the Democratic city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and downtrending crime rates . Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, took to X to document a few of the more than 80 arrests he said agents had made. He also posted a highly-edited video of uniformed CBP officers handcuffing people. “From border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls,” he posted on X, referring to Charlotte. The effort was dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” as a play on the title of a famous children’s book that isn’t about North Carolina. Some welcomed the intervention, including Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby, who said in a post Saturday that the county GOP “stands with the rule of law — and with every Charlottean’s safety first.” Related Stories 1 Israeli killed and 3 wounded in West Bank attack 4 MIN READ Zelenskyy, US envoy will visit Turkey in a new bid to end the Russia-Ukraine war 3 MIN READ FlyDubai orders 150 Airbus A321neo aircraft, expanding its fleet beyond Boeing for the first time 3 MIN READ Fear and many questions People rally against federal immigration enforcement after agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations across Charlotte. (AP video: Erik Verduzco) The flurry of activity prompted fear and questions, including where detainees would be held, how long the operation would last and what agents’ tactics — criticized elsewhere as aggressive and racist — would look like in North Carolina. On Saturday, at least one U.S. citizen said he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on At Camino, a nonprofit group that offers services to Latino communities, some said they were too afraid to leave their homes to attend school, medical appointments or work. A dental clinic the group runs had nine cancellations on Friday, spokesperson Paola Garcia said. “Latinos love this country. They came here to escape socialism and communism, and they’re hard workers and people of faith,” Garcia said. “They love their family, and it’s just so sad to see that this community now has this target on their back.” Bovino’s operations in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered lawsuits over the use of force, including widespread deployment of chemical agents . Democratic leaders in both cities accused agents of inflaming community tensions. Federal agents fatally shot one suburban Chicago man during a traffic stop. Bovino, head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, and other Trump administration officials have called their tactics appropriate for growing threats on agents. Bovino posted pictures Sunday of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens,” meaning people living in the U.S. without legal permission who allegedly have criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions. “We arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can’t continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino said.

In the Chicago area, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the region from September to last week. U.S. citizens were detained during several operations. Dozens of protesters were arrested. By Sunday, reports of CBP activity around Charlotte were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email. “The past two hours we’ve received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said. City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said federal agents appeared to be focused on churches and apartment buildings. “Houses of worship. I mean, that’s just awful,” he said. “These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people’s right to worship.” DHS says so-called sanctuary policy plays a role in Charlotte operation Two people were arrested during a small protest Sunday outside a DHS office in Charlotte and taken to a local FBI office, said Xavier T. de Janon, an attorney who was representing them. He said it remained unclear what charges they faced. DHS said it was focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents. Most North Carolina county jail operators have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. But some non-cooperation policies have existed in a handful of places in the state, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement. In Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, the sheriff previously did not honor detainers but said the jail now does as required under changes made to state law since last year. Several county jails house immigrant arrestees and honor detainers, which allow jails to hold detainees for immigration officers to pick them up. But Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, does not. Also, the city’s police department does not help with immigration enforcement. DHS alleged that about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored, putting the public at risk. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ___ This story has been updated to correct which of North Carolina’s county jail operators honor immigration detainers. Most have long honored detainer requests, and the Mecklenburg County sheriff says his jail also does so now as required under changes made to state law since last year. The story summary also misspelled the federal operation’s name, which is “Charlotte’s Web,” not “Charlotte’s Webb.” ___ Tareen and Dale reported from Chicago.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday applauded the United Nations’ approval of the Trump administration’s blueprint to secure and govern Gaza , while Hamas rejected the plan as a foreign instrument of control. The resolution that passed the U.N. Security Council on Monday authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in war-devastated Gaza, approves a transitional authority called the Board of Peace to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state. “We believe that President Trump‘s plan will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza,” Netanyahu’s office wrote on X Tuesday. The resolution provides a wide mandate for the international force, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing Gaza. Authorization for the board and force expire at the end of 2027. Hamas rejects plan The U.S. plan calls for the stabilization force to ensure “the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” It authorizes the force “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate” in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force. Hamas said Monday that the force’s mandate including disarmament “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.” It said the resolution did not “meet the level of our Palestinian people’s political and humanitarian demands and rights.” Hamas demanded that any international force be under U.N. supervision, deploy only at Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and operate exclusively with Palestinian institutions. Palestinian Authority welcomes resolution after statehood is included The Palestinian Authority welcomed the resolution and said it was ready to immediately implement it on the ground. It said it would cooperate with the U.S., the U.N., and other Arab and European states. Palestinians largely view the PA, which governs semiautonomous zones in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as weak and corrupt. The authority’s security coordination with Israel is extremely unpopular, and many Palestinians see it as a subcontractor of the occupation. The U.N. vote came about following nearly two weeks of negotiations , when Arab nations and the Palestinians pressed the United States to strengthen language about Palestinian self-determination. The proposal still gives no timeline or guarantee for an independent state, only saying it’s possible after advances in the reconstruction of Gaza and reforms of the Palestinian Authority. The U.S. revised the resolution to say that after those steps, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,” it adds. Resolution gains support from Muslim-majority and Arab countries A key to the resolution’s adoption was support from Arab and other Muslim nations that had been critical for the ceasefire and potentially could contribute to the international force. The U.S. mission to the United Nations distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for “swift adoption” of the U.S. proposal. Both Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, and Turkey said they would work toward a two-state solution, which Netanyahu has opposed. Turkish officials have previously said Turkey is ready to contribute to an international force in Gaza despite Israeli opposition to a Turkish presence. The vote shores up hopes that Gaza’s fragile ceasefire will be maintained following a war set off by Hamas’ surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s offensive has killed over 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Tuesday that the international community needed to “work together to take forward the 20 point plan and to turn it into a just and lasting peace.” Cooper called for “urgent action to open all the crossings, lift restrictions and flood Gaza with aid.” What else the US proposal says Trump said the members of the Board of Peace will be named in the coming weeks, along with “many more exciting announcements.” The plan calls for the stabilization troops to secure Gaza border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted. The force will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance, and should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel. As the international force establishes control, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza “based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization.” These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says. —— Associated Press writers Edith Lederer at the United Nations, Suzan Frazer in Ankara, Turkey and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/worlds-fossil-fuel-obsession-threatens-billions-of-lives-amnesty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"15:41:35+00:00","title":"World’s ‘fossil fuel obsession’ threatens billions of lives: Amnesty","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amnesty International has released a report warning that the global expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure — affecting over 3.5 billion people and located on significant portions of Indigenous lands — poses a direct threat to human health and fundamental human rights.

globe, Amnesty International has said in a new report, urging world leaders to halt an “obsession” with energy sources that fuel the climate crisis.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report found that at least 2 billion people – about one-quarter of the world’s population – live within 5km (3.1 miles) of more than 18,000 fossil fuel infrastructure sites currently in operation.\n\nMore than 3,500 new sites are also being developed that will affect 135 million more people, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard told reporters.\n\n“This ever-expanding industry is endangering billions of lives, irreversibly altering the climate system and destroying  critical natural  ecosystem[s],” Callamard said at a news conference on the sidelines of the COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil, where the report’s findings were unveiled.\n\nLiving near fossil fuel infrastructure – such as oil-and-gas extraction sites and coal mines and plants – has been associated with elevated risks of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems, Amnesty said in its report.\n\nThe industry has also been linked to human rights abuses, including killings and enforced disappearances, particularly against  environmental activists  and Indigenous peoples defending their territories against fossil fuel projects.\n\nWednesday’s report noted that “despite representing less than 5 percent of the global population, at least 16.1 percent of known global fossil fuel infrastructure is sited on Indigenous territories” around the world.\n\n“We are presenting those findings here at COP to warn of the current harm, to warn of the immense damage that the fossil fuel obsession is doing to many peoples and to warn against what they are going to do to future generations,” Callamard said.\n\n“The age of fossil fuel must end now. It is a major source of human rights violations. It may be one of the main source[s] of human rights violations historically speaking.”\n\nWorld leaders, human rights activists, climate experts and others have been gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for COP30, the UN’s annual climate conference.\n\nWhile countries have pledged to tackle the climate crisis, observers have questioned how they plan to  meet their commitments  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fossil fuel projects continue to expand.\n\nIndigenous activists also  stormed the summit  this week to demand that their voices be heard in the discussions.\n\nKumi Naidoo, president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty campaign, called on world leaders to leave COP30 with “a clear statement that you are going to support a roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels”.\n\n“It’s high time that we recognise that, for 30 years … we’ve been mopping up the floor and treating the symptoms of the problem without turning off the tap,” Naidoo said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\n“Let’s be very clear and say it over and over again, that the primary cause of the climate emergency is our addiction and our dependency on fossil fuels.”\n\nAccording to the UN, coal, oil and gas “are by far the largest contributor[s] to global climate change”, responsible for about 68 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 80 percent of people around the globe want their leaders to take stronger action to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, according to a 2024 UN Development Programme  survey .\n\nSeventy-two percent of people also said they supported a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the same survey found."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"13:46:39Z","title":"As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is facing a worsening water crisis, marked by its sixth consecutive year of drought and extreme heat, with only 2.3mm of precipitation recorded in early November—81% below the historical average.

2025-11-12T13:46:39+00:00\n\nTitle: As the dams feeding Tehran run dry, Iran struggles with a dire water crisis\n\nTehran, Iran –  Authorities are scrambling to provide drinking water across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Iranians grapple with the  effects of multiple ongoing crises .\n\nIf there is no rain by next month, water will have to be rationed in Tehran; in fact, the city of 10 million may even have to be evacuated, President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a speech on Friday.\n\nWhile experts say evacuating the city is a last resort that will likely not come to pass, the president’s stark warning is indicative of the mammoth burden facing the country of more than 90 million, its ailing economy reeling under sanctions.\n\nIran is now grappling with its sixth consecutive year of drought, while heatwaves  pushed temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius  (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the summer.\n\nThe past water year, ending in late September 2025, was one of the driest on record, with the current year shaping up to be worse, with Iran receiving only 2.3mm (0.09 inches) of precipitation by early November, down by 81 percent compared with the historical average of the same period, the Meteorological Organization said.\n\nA whopping 19 dams – up from nine three weeks ago – are on the verge of drying out, filled to less than 5 percent capacity. Dozens of others are not faring much better, according to data from the Water Resources Management Company.\n\nMost of the five  major dams feeding Tehran  from nearby mountain ranges, the Lar, Latyan, Karaj (Amir Kabir), Taleqan and Mamloo Dams, are at extremely low capacity, with an average of about 10 percent capacity.\n\nA swimmer went viral last week with a video from the Karaj reservoir, showing that the water level was so low that he could walk in parts of it.\n\nAll eyes are on the skies as authorities are left with very limited options.\n\nFarshid Vahedifard, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Tufts University, said the situation will deteriorate unless the country receives substantial rain and snowfall in critical regions.\n\n“Otherwise, the human toll, both economic and social, will be severe,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Water scarcity is already fueling local tensions and protests, which could escalate into broader social conflict, especially as major economic hardships [rising inflation, unemployment, housing issues, and the high cost of living] further erode people’s capacity to cope.”\n\nEnergy Minister Abbas Aliabadi told reporters on Saturday that the state will imminently start rationing water, even fully shutting it off at night across the country if necessary.\n\nEven before the announcement, people online and some media reported that water stopped at night in Tehran. Millions suffered the effects of  unannounced water  cut-offs during the summer, as well.\n\nAliabadi blamed some of the strain on infrastructure damage from the  12-day war with Israel in June  and said high-consuming urban users will be penalised. He urged people to buy water storage tanks.\n\nAuthorities have long put the onus on people, urging them to consume less. But even if Iranians reduce usage by 20 percent, as authorities demand, household consumption is believed to be less than 8 percent of all use, nearly all the rest going to agriculture.\n\nLocal newspapers this week offered a mix of criticism and despair.\n\nThe moderate Etemad newspaper said “unqualified” managers in key positions are a root cause of the issue, while reformist daily Shargh wrote that the environment is being “sacrificed for the sake of politics”.\n\nIran is far from the only country in the region, or the world,  feeling the ramifications  of a warming climate. But it is doing worse than most big countries in the region.\n\nKaveh Madani, director of the UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health and a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment, said that despite Iran not being a water-rich nation, a mix of bad management, lack of foresight and overreliance on technology created a perception of water availability.\n\n“For example, Tehran is a dry place, but you keep bringing water to it, building dams, thinking you can always supply more water to it,” Madani said, adding that, as a result, Iran is now “water bankrupt” – among other things.\n\n“We are not only seeing water bankruptcy … but also energy bankruptcy, natural gas bankruptcy … All of these are signals that tell us how limited resource growth is.\n\n“But I think with the first rain or flood, people could forget about the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe first time Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly called on Iranians to consume less water was almost 15 years ago.\n\nBut things have gotten chronically worse since, and no government,  reformist, moderate or hardline , has managed to ward off water insecurity as Iran pursued development with little regard to sustainability.\n\nSix years of drought can paralyse any nation, but this does not justify the current lack of water resilience, Madani said, adding that Iran could use this period of focus on water to implement meaningful change, which would require long-term policies that do not yield results in the short run.\n\n“So it requires a real patriot to be willing to be crucified by the general public but bring a collective win for Iranians in the long term. I don’t think that person currently exists, and the things we see in Iran don’t make a radical reform plausible.”\n\nIranian law stipulates that 85 percent of domestic food be produced locally, Morad Kaviani, professor of geography and hydropolitics at Iran’s Kharazmi University, told state television last week.\n\nHowever, he added, Iran does not have the water and soil capacities, and nearly 30 percent of agricultural produce is wasted due to a lack of infrastructure, outdated irrigation practices and misguided crop selection.\n\nModernisation and rapid industrial growth were straining water resources before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and the agricultural self-sufficiency policy that came after made things worse.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Iran’s water supply is devoted to agriculture, which only accounted for about 12 percent of Iran’s GDP and about 14 percent of employment in the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2025, according to the Statistical Center of Iran.\n\nBut people working in the relatively small sector are also suffering as water sources rapidly dry up.\n\nPost-revolution governments, often through the construction arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), built hundreds of dams and wells, over-interfering with rivers, while many reservoirs sat partially empty.\n\nAuthorities have been tapping groundwater reserves at unchecked rates, too, leading to widespread land sinking and ecosystem collapse in areas like Isfahan in central Iran and Sistan and Baluchestan to the southeast.\n\nTehran and many other cities have outgrown their supplies, forcing reliance on water transfers from distant aquifers via outdated infrastructure.\n\nIran is also unable to attract foreign investment to save its ailing infrastructure due  to the devastating sanctions for years  that have been in place for years.\n\nUnder the sanctions, Iran cannot diversify modes of employment in rural areas where most people engage in water-intensive agriculture, forcing continued water allocation to agriculture out of fear that threatening those farm jobs could cause protests and even create a national security risk, the UN university’s Madani said.\n\nAbout a third of all water in Iran is wasted or spent without yielding returns, state media cited the Water and Wastewater Company of Iran as saying in late September.\n\nThat includes about 15 percent in physical losses, and more than 16 percent classified as illegal consumption, free public use, and meter error.\n\nVahedifard, the professor, pointed out that the government has launched short-term measures such as desalination and inter-basin transfers, but the water system is already in “an almost unrecoverable state” after decades of mismanagement and ignored warnings by experts.\n\n“Planning must now focus on managing the reality of scarcity … shifting from supply-oriented engineering to resilience-based management, centred on groundwater recharge and aquifer restoration,” Vahedifard said, adding that Iran also needs infrastructure investment, transparent data sharing, integrated water–energy–agriculture planning, and genuine community participation.\n\nHe said different communities across Iran face different risk thresholds based on socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and there are deep disparities between urban and rural areas and central and peripheral provinces in terms of being prioritised in national water and infrastructure policies.\n\n“Ultimately, equitable water management is not just about fairness,” he said. “It’s fundamental to Iran’s environmental stability and social cohesion.”"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5464815","dateOfPublication":"2025-07-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Transformative Power of Keeping a Daily Journal","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Suleika Jaouad, a mental health advocate and author, shares her transformative experience with daily journaling, especially during her battle with leukemia and the pandemic.

    \n        \n      \n\n         Writer  Suleika Jaouad  has been keeping a journal for as long as she could hold a pen. It got her through her battle with leukemia at age 22, life after treatment and then the pandemic. But at a certain point, \"I was starting to get bored of the sound of my own voice and grievances,\" she says. So she began reading the diaries and journals of her favorite writers for inspiration:  Isabelle Eberhardt ,  Audre Lorde ,  Sylvia Plath  and  Susan Sontag . Jaouad would pick a passage at random to read before journaling and found it had a \"kaleidoscopic effect\" on her writing, she says. It allowed the \"light to fall differently,\" changing her perspective and creating new ways of thinking. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She expands on this approach to journaling in her latest book,  The Book of Alchemy: A Creative Practice for an Inspired Life , published this spring. It's a collection of essays and writing prompts from 100 writers and artists, including poet and essayist Hanif Abdurraqib, writer and director Lena Dunham and illustrator Oliver Jeffers. She hopes the book \"ignites a little spark if you're feeling like you don't know what to say or you've been saying something the same way,\" she says. Jaouad, 37, who runs  The Isolation Journals , an online journaling community that she started during the COVID-19 pandemic, talked to NPR about the transformative power of writing, favorite prompts and how to build a journaling practice. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. You talk about journaling as a form of alchemy. What does that mean?  It   was   the closest I have felt to finding a direct line to my subconscious and arriving at a place of alchemy. By the end of writing my way through a journal, I felt some small shift had been enacted. Even if I had nothing of interest or import to say that day, some kind of transmutation had taken place. So \"alchemy\" feels apt when it comes to keeping a journal. In taking a moment each day to write your thoughts, show up and write your way back to yourself, you take the grist of everyday life and transform it. Do you think there's value in journaling during the difficult moments of our lives? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The journal is the space where I go to make sense of what has happened to me. [It gives me] the opportunity to reflect and figure out how I'm going to choose my response. In those moments in my life when I felt most laid bare, the journal has been a hiding place and a fighting place. Can you share some favorite journal prompts from your book? One of my favorite prompts is called \" Just Ten Images \" by [memoir writer and photographer]  Ash Parsons Story . When her adopted son was [born prematurely and] in the neonatal intensive care unit, she was exhausted and did not have time to do much of anything, much less journal. So she decided to record 10 images from the last 24 hours, and she did this every day in list form. I love the prompt because it's straightforward and always yields something unexpected. It has just enough structure that you don't have to think too hard. Another prompt I write to a lot is called \" A Day in the Life of My Dreams \" by  Hollye Jacobs , a pediatric hospice nurse. Write a day, from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep, in the life of your dreams a couple of years out. But do so in present tense. I like this prompt because it forces me not just to imagine myself in the future but to articulate what I want for myself in that future. What advice do you have for someone who is just starting out with journaling and isn't sure where to start? Set a specific duration of time you plan to do it daily. It could be five days, a week or 30 days. Only by doing it consistently do you start to write through the fog and get somewhere unexpected and interesting. Fold it into some nonnegotiable part of your routine. For me, my nonnegotiable is my first cup of coffee in the morning. I sit down at my kitchen table each morning and write in my journal with that first cup. It always happens because the coffee always happens. Keep the barrier to entry low. I was hosting a journaling club, and I asked this man, \"Why not journal in the Notes app on your phone?\" He said, \"Well, that just seems like the wrong way to journal. I feel like it has to be in a notebook with a pen.\" We have all of these expectations we bring that hinder our enjoyment of it. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to keep a journal.

2025-11-15T16:17:00+00:00\n\nTitle: Thousands march for climate action outside COP30 summit in Brazil\n\nThousands of people have marched through the streets of the Brazilian city of Belem, calling for the  voices of Indigenous peoples  and environmental defenders to be heard at the United Nations COP30 climate summit.\n\nIndigenous community members mixed with activists at Saturday’s march, which unfolded in a festive atmosphere as participants carried a giant beach ball representing the Earth and a Brazilian flag emblazoned with the words “Protected Amazon”.\n\nIt was the first major protest outside the conference, which began earlier this week in Belem, bringing together world leaders, activists and experts in a push to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nIndigenous activists previously  stormed the summit , disrupting the proceedings as they demanded that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva take concrete action to ensure their territories are protected from growing threats.\n\nAmnesty International warned in a recent report that  billions of people  around the world are threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel projects, such as oil-and-gas pipelines and coal mines.\n\nIndigenous communities , in particular, sit on the front lines of much of this development, the rights group said.\n\nBranded the “Great People’s March” by organisers, Saturday’s rally in Belem came at the halfway point of contentious COP30 negotiations.\n\n“Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed,” Benedito Huni Kuin, a 50-year-old member of the Huni Kuin Indigenous group from western Brazil, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We want to make our voices heard from  the Amazon  and demand results,” he said. “We need more Indigenous representatives at COP to defend our rights.”\n\nYouth leader Ana Heloisa Alves, 27, said it was the biggest climate march she has participated in. “This is incredible,” she told The Associated Press. “You can’t ignore all these people.”\n\nThe COP30 talks come as  the UN warned  earlier this month that the world was on track to exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark of global warming – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said UNEP chief Inger Andersen.\n\nDespite that urgency, a nalysts and some COP30 participants have said they don’t expect any major new agreements to emerge from the talks, which conclude on November 21.\n\nStill, some are hoping for progress on some past promises, including  funding to help

built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/at-least-2-dead-21-missing-in-landslides-in-indonesias-java-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-14","timeOfPublication":"05:54:13+00:00","title":"At least 2 dead, 21 missing in landslides in Indonesia’s Java island","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A landslide in Cilacap district, Central Java, Indonesia, on Thursday evening killed at least two people and left 21 missing, as heavy rainfall from the ongoing monsoon season triggered the disaster.

Asiatic bear attacks are more frequent, but brown bear attacks are more dangerous.\n\nShota Mochizuki, associate professor at Fukushima University, told Al Jazeera: “This is largely because black bears are widely distributed across Honshu and Shikoku, where many people live, while brown bears inhabit only Hokkaido, resulting in fewer opportunities for encounters with humans.”\n\n“However, attacks by brown bears are far more severe. Brown bears are significantly larger and stronger, and their attacks much more often lead to serious injuries or fatalities,” he added.\n\nBut why is there an increase in bear attacks this year and how is Japan responding?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nAccording to Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, the country’s northern prefectures – districts under the control of a prefect or governor – have been the worst affected by bear attacks.\n\nEarlier this week, NHK said five people had been killed in Iwate, two in Hokkaido, one each in Nagano and Miyagi, and four in Akita so far this year.\n\nBear sightings in Akita prefecture have risen sixfold this year, and bears have attacked more than 50 people since May. Most of the attacks in Akita have been by Asiatic black bears and have taken place in residential areas.\n\nAccording to NHK, on November 9, a bear assaulted a 78-year-old woman in Gojome Town and then attacked a 50-year-old woman who came to help when she heard the older woman screaming. Both were admitted to a hospital in Akita City and are still alive. An elderly woman in Akita city was killed after encountering a bear while working on a farm in late October.\n\nIn an Instagram post last month, the Kenta Suzuki, the governor of the mountainous region, said that “the situation has already surpassed what the prefecture and municipalities can handle on their own”.\n\n“Exhaustion on the ground is reaching its limit,” he added.\n\nIn an interview last month, Billy Halloran, who is from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently lives in Japan, told CNN about a serious black bear attack he had experienced in the woods of Myoko in northern Japan when he went for a run in early October.\n\nHe said he saw two bears staring at him from bushes nearby and, when he tried to back away, one bear started moving towards him. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he told CNN.\n\nHe held up his arm in front of his face, but the bear seized it and pushed him to the ground. “Then in one bite, my arm was done,” he said.\n\nThe bear attack has left him with a broken arm and an injured leg, Halloran said. He has required three surgeries, and metal plates have been inserted into his arm.\n\nAttacks have also taken place in central Japan. Last month, a bear entered a supermarket in Numata city and attacked shoppers, according to NHK. While nobody was killed, police officials said some people sustained injuries, although they did not say how serious they were.\n\nThe surge in attacks has prompted some countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, to issue travel advisories to citizens living or travelling to Japan.\n\nIn a “wildlife alert” issued on Wednesday, the US Department of State said: “Bear sightings and attacks have increased in parts of Japan, especially in municipalities close to or adjacent to populated zones.\n\n“In Sapporo, authorities closed Maruyama Park in Sapporo, which is adjacent to the US Consulate General, for two weeks following a bear sighting in the park.\n\n“Although the Consulate is located outside of the park, we encourage all visitors for routine or other services to be diligent and aware of your surroundings.”\n\nIn late October, the UK’s Foreign Office warned British travellers not to venture alone into forest areas and to avoid leaving litter and food waste if they do.\n\nMochizuki said one reason is a food shortage for bears in the mountainous regions of the country. He said bears mainly feed on acorns and beech nuts, which have not been abundant this year.\n\n“In years when natural food is scarce, bears are more likely to venture into human settlements in search of food,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, there was a surge of attacks in 2023 following poor acorn yields. Some experts say climate change is a reason for the low production.\n\nMochizuki noted that bear populations have also expanded in the country “due to long-term conservation and reduced hunting pressure” and said that this factor has increased bears’ “contact zones with humans”. According to the government, the overall bear population is currently more than 54,000.\n\nIn 2012, the Environment Ministry’s biodiversity centre said the number of black bears was about 15,000, while brown bear numbers have doubled since 1990, although it did not give numbers.\n\nMochizuki said that another reason bear attacks are rising is rural depopulation, caused by young people leaving their villages and moving to cities for better job opportunities.\n\n“As rural areas age and decline, unmanaged fields and village edges create easy access routes for bears,” he added.\n\nLast week, Japan’s military and riot police were deployed to the scenic mountainous region of Akita to try to contain the surge in bear attacks.\n\nBut while riot police are authorised to shoot the bears, military personnel are not and must work alongside private hunters.\n\n“The Japan Self-Defense Forces are legally restricted to national defence and disaster relief, and therefore have no legal authority to kill wildlife,” Mochizuki said.\n\n“Hunters, by contrast, hold official hunting licences and firearm permits under Japan’s Wildlife Protection and Management Law. They can be formally authorised by prefectural governments to conduct nuisance control, including the shooting of bears when necessary,” he added.\n\nSo the military has been helping the region’s local community by setting up bear traps or removing carcasses of the bears shot by hunters they are working with.\n\nResidents of affected areas, especially Akita, have been using AI-surveillance systems and drones to alert them to the presence of bears, according to Akita’s mayor.\n\nNHK reported that people have also been advised not to leave food around when they go on picnics in the forest, and also to cut down any nut-bearing trees that may attract bears.\n\nMochizuki said three main measures can prove effective.\n\n“Firstly, food sources around human settlements should be eliminated,” he said. “Proper management of garbage, abandoned fruit trees, and garden produce is the most effective preventive measure.”\n\nHe added that physical barriers such as electric fencing around farms or village perimeters “can significantly reduce bear entry”.\n\n“Thirdly, early detection through camera traps, sensors and GPS data, rapid communication through mobile alerts can help communities respond quickly to bear presence,” he said.\n\nMochizuki acknowledged that while the military and police have been deployed to assist bear hunters, the country faces a shortage of hunters and wildlife personnel due to its ageing population.\n\n“Recruiting younger members and increasing municipal staff capacity is essential,” he said.\n\nLast, Mochizuki highlighted the importance of educating residents and tourists about the bears.\n\n“Many people, including international visitors, are unfamiliar with bear behaviour and safety practices and need better guidance,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/ex-harvard-president-larry-summers-apologises-over-epstein-emails","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:59:33+00:00","title":"Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers apologises over Epstein emails","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury secretary, has apologised for maintaining email correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, from 2017 to 2019.

apologised and says he will be stepping back from public life after his email exchanges with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.\n\n“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement published by CBS News on Monday.\n\n“While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me,” he said.\n\nThe emails were among the 20,000 pages of documents obtained from Epstein’s estate and released last week by the United States House Committee on Oversight amid ongoing questions about the ex-financier’s relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was previously convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor, but he served a light 13-month sentence. Before his downfall in 2019, Epstein was in constant contact with world leaders, celebrities, and high-profile figures like Summers.\n\nThe emails between Epstein and Summers span from at least 2017 to 2019 and cover a range of topics, including US foreign policy to Trump’s first presidency, as well as personal matters.\n\nIn one email from 2017, Summers advises Epstein that his “pal”, billionaire Thomas Barrack Jr, should stay out of the press following a Washington Post story about Barrack Jr’s relationship with both Trump and political lobbyist Paul Manafort.\n\n“Public link to manafort will be a disaster,” he wrote. “This is a staggering [expletive] show.”\n\nIn another December 2018 email, Summers asks Epstein for help securing an invitation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which Epstein appears to turn down.\n\nSummers previously served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and as an adviser to President Barack Obama. He also served as the president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006, when he was forced to resign over remarks suggesting that women were less adept at maths and science than men due to biological differences.\n\nHis recent posts include board member at OpenAI and distinguished senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress, according to NBC News. He remained a tenured professor at Harvard after stepping down.\n\nIn his emails with Epstein, Summers appears to have held on to his beliefs about women more than 10 years later. In one October 2017 email to Epstein about an event that included “lots of slathering to Saudis”, he wrote that he “yipped about inclusion”.\n\n“I observed that half the IQ in world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of the population …,” he wrote in the email to Epstein.\n\nIn another email the same month, written at the height of the #MeToo movement, Summers appeared disenchanted with the wave of resignations over sexual and personal misconduct by US public figures.\n\n“I’m trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank,” he said in the email to Epstein.\n\nIn another email exchange between late November and early December 2018, he and Epstein discuss his relationship with a female colleague at length and how Summers – who was then in his mid-60s – should handle the situation.\n\n“Think for now I’m going nowhere with her except economics mentor. I think I’m right now in the seen very warmly in rearview mirror category. She did not want to have a drink cuz she was ‘tired.’ I left the hotel lobby somewhat abruptly. When I’m reflective, I think I’m dodging a bullet,” Summers wrote to Epstein.\n\n“Smart. Assertive and clear. Gorgeous.

What we know\n\nScientists have issued alerts for approaching solar or geomagnetic storms, which are set to hit Earth this week and will produce bright, stunning displays of light known as auroras over parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, while also temporarily disrupting some communications.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said significant geomagnetic disturbances had been recorded in the past few days, specifically in the form of several “coronal mass ejections” (CMEs), which occur when the sun issues bursts of energy. The agency issued a “G4” geomagnetic storm watch signal on a five-level scale, implying that severe storms could be expected.\n\nSome US residents have already shared videos online of northern lights – also known as aurora borealis – which will continue to appear over several US states on Wednesday.\n\nDid you catch the light show between the breaks in the clouds this evening?  #NorthernLights\n\nSpace Weather Center:  https://t.co/M5cIvJxUr1   pic.twitter.com/RiDXgF3BqI\n\n— NWS Reno (@NWSReno)  November 12, 2025\n\nHere’s what we know about the geomagnetic storms and why they occur.\n\nSolar storms occur as a result of sudden, eruptive disturbances on the sun.  A solar storm becomes a geomagnetic storm when it reaches the Earth.\n\nSolar storms can occur in two ways. One way is in the form of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are sudden swellings of gases on the sun that burst from the sun and travel at more than 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h) towards Earth. Depending on how fast they travel, these can reach the Earth anytime between 15 hours and several days.\n\nSolar storms can also emerge in the form of solar flares, which are sudden eruptions of electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth from the sun. These travel at the speed of light, reaching Earth in approximately eight minutes, and can last for several minutes or even hours.\n\nBoth phenomena happen when magnetic fields on the sun realign. They often, but not always, occur together.\n\nWhile CMEs can appear through solar telescopes as immense clouds of particles being hurled in a single direction, solar flares appear as bright flashes of light moving in multiple directions. As NASA describes it, think of it as the difference between a cannonball shot in one direction and the flash of a muzzle.\n\nThe NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center said on Tuesday that at least three CMEs would pass over Earth, most likely between Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nIn an update early on Wednesday, the agency noted that two of the CMEs, which first erupted on November 9 and 10, had already impacted Earth. They “packed quite a punch”, Shawn Dahl, a scientist with the agency, said in a video update posted on X.\n\nDahl said the storms were “profoundly more strong than we anticipated” and that while the agency had initially forecasted a G2-level storm, the storms were two levels stronger, at G4.\n\nA third, energetic CME, moving faster than the others, is now set to hit Earth on Wednesday, approximately at midday Eastern Time (17:00 GMT), the space agency said. That one erupted early on November 11 and caused temporary radio blackouts across Africa and Europe, according to Space.com, a leading space exploration publication.\n\nWhen strong bursts of energy erupting from the Sun’s surface as solar flares or CMEs hurtle towards Earth, the highly charged particles they carry collide with gases in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and transfer energy to them, causing the gases to glow and resulting in stunning displays of colourful lights, from emerald greens to intense pinks.\n\nKnown as aurora borealis, those displays can be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, hence the term “northern lights”. “Southern lights” or aurora australis are displays which can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere, although far fewer people inhabit the areas from which they are visible. The lights are only visible close to the poles because the Earth’s magnetic fields, which are strongest at the poles, guide the sun’s charged particles towards them.\n\nLight displays have become more common in recent months because the sun is currently at the maximum phase of an 11-year activity cycle.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun’s poles swap places, causing intense magnetic activity. This period, called solar maximum, can last for several months. Scientists speculate that the end of the current cycle began last year and will continue at least through to the end of this year.\n\nIn May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades hit Earth and caused dazzling light displays across the US, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe northern lights shot with my iPhone (just this second) in Boulder, Colorado. This is a very impressive event!  pic.twitter.com/vkHS00PMLt\n\n— Dr. Ryan French (@RyanJFrench)  November 12, 2025\n\nSeveral countries have issued aurora alerts, with some residents already reporting brilliant colours in the sky on Tuesday night.\n\nBrightness and visibility usually depend on what time of day the solar bursts arrive in the Earth’s atmosphere and how they interact with it. Experts recommend leaving brightly-lit areas to see the lights better.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the lights have already appeared or are likely to appear above several areas in the US, including the states of Illinois (Chicago), Colorado, Massachusetts (Boston), Washington (Seattle), California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Dallas), Georgia (Atlanta), North Dakota (Bismarck), New York, Wyoming (Cheyenne), North Carolina (Raleigh) and Iowa.\n\nJust keeps going and these are just holding phone in long exposure mode of 3 seconds.

The intense activity could also temporarily disrupt power grids.\n\nOn rare occasions, solar eruptions can be damaging. A severe solar storm in September 1859 caused sparks and fires in telegraph stations across Europe and North America. Known as the Carrington Event, those storms were the most intense in recorded history.\n\nIn August 1972, powerful geomagnetic events caused widespread electric and communications disruptions in the US and accidentally detonated US naval mines positioned in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Dahl of the NOAA, the agency has alerted US air traffic officials, and a planned space launch, the details of which have not been disclosed, is likely to be cancelled. Power grid officials have also been alerted, he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:46:54+00:00","title":"China suspends Japanese film releases amid diplomatic row over Taiwan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has suspended the release of two Japanese anime films in mainland China amid a sharp diplomatic row over Taiwan, following Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s suggestion that Tokyo could intervene militarily if China attempted to take control of Taiwan.

people suspected of being in the United States illegally have been detained in Charlotte, North Carolina, authorities said, as President Donald Trump’s nationwide deportation push intensifies. The raids took place over just two days.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nFederal agents swept into Charlotte, North Carolina, on Saturday, escalating Trump’s widening immigration crackdown and turning the city into the latest focal point for large-scale arrests in Democratic-led areas. Charlotte is a Democratic-leaning city of about 950,000 people and a financial services hub.\n\nOfficers were seen outside churches, around apartment complexes, and along busy shopping corridors as the operation unfolded.\n\n“We are increasing the presence of DHS law enforcement in Charlotte to keep Americans safe and remove threats to public safety,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Homeland Security officials, 44 of the  detainees  have criminal records, including two described as gang members. The alleged offences include driving while intoxicated, assault, trespassing, larceny and hit-and-run. One arrested person, according to the commander leading the raids, is a registered sex offender.\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary Noem will not back down from their mission to make America safe again.\n\nNorth Carolina sanctuary politicians are protecting the nearly 1,400 criminal illegal aliens in Charlotte’s jails by REFUSING to turn them over to ICE, ultimately releasing these…  pic.twitter.com/rM2kt3gLuB\n\n— Homeland Security (@DHSgov)  November 17, 2025\n\nThe DHS has labelled the raids Operation Charlotte’s Web, playing on the title of the famous children’s book, which is not about North Carolina.\n\nThe book, Charlotte’s Web, follows a pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of being killed, Charlotte writes messages in her web to try to save him.\n\nBut in Charlotte, the city, the web is not a saviour — it is the dragnet to catch immigrants.\n\n“Wherever the wind takes us. High, low. Near, far. East, west. North, south. We take to the breeze, we go as we please,” Gregory Bovino, the DHS commander leading the raids, said on X on Saturday, quoting from the iconic book.\n\n“This time, the breeze hit Charlotte like a storm. From border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls.”\n\n‘Wherever the wind takes us. High, low. Near, far. East, west. North, south. We take to the breeze, we go as we please.’ — Charlotte’s Web\n\nThis time, the breeze hit Charlotte like a storm. From border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls. #DHS   #CBP …  pic.twitter.com/de0nqHn3vR\n\n— Commander Op At Large CA Gregory K. Bovino (@CMDROpAtLargeCA)  November 16, 2025\n\nYet the DHS decision to use a popular children’s book title for a campaign that is expected to break up several families has also faced criticism, including from the granddaughter of EB White, the author of Charlotte’s Web.\n\n“He believed in the rule of law and due process,” Martha White said in a statement, referring to her grandfather. “He certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”\n\nOfficials insist the surge is aimed at tackling crime, arguing — as the Trump administration has in other cities that have been targeted in similar raids — that local authorities have failed to ensure law and order.\n\nHowever, local leaders have objected to the raids and pointed to police data, which shows that crime has been declining.\n\nAccording to  data  released by the city, crime has dropped 8 percent from last year, with violent crimes down 20 percent.\n\nHowever, Charlotte nevertheless grabbed national and global attention this summer when Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on a light-rail train, in an attack captured on video. The suspect is a US citizen, but the Trump administration repeatedly emphasised that he had been arrested more than a dozen times before.\n\nThe DHS also said the Charlotte raids happened because local officials did not honour nearly 1,400 requests to hold people for up to 48 hours after their release, which would have allowed immigration agents to take them into custody.\n\n“I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said in a statement, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a part of the DHS that has been leading anti-immigrant raids in multiple urban areas across the country. Charlotte falls in Mecklenburg County.\n\nTensions remain high. “Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,” state Republican chairman Jason Simmons said on Monday, even though ICE agents have also arrested several visa holders and permanent residents — all living legally in the US — during the raids.\n\nGregory Bovino is a senior US Border Patrol official who has become a central figure in Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdowns in big cities. He has led the high-profile enforcement campaign in Chicago since September and has also been involved in operations in Los Angeles and now Charlotte.\n\nBovino has frequently served as the public face of these efforts — holding press briefings, giving interviews, and promoting arrest numbers as signs of success.\n\nHis approach has drawn controversy. Civil rights groups, local officials, and legal experts have criticised tactics used under his command, including aggressive arrests, the use of chemical agents against detainees, and the use of Border Patrol troops far from the US border. Several operations have faced legal challenges, and judges as well as local leaders have questioned whether federal agents are acting within their jurisdiction.\n\nRegarding the use of chemical agents, Bovino told The Associated Press news agency that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what his agents encounter. “We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.” CS gas is a tear gas commonly used by federal agents.\n\nLocal reporting shows that Charlotte’s immigrant neighbourhoods felt the impact immediately. The Charlotte Observer described how a baker, Manuel “Manolo” Betancur,  shut down  his bakery on Saturday afternoon — the first closure in its 28-year history — after learning that Border Patrol agents had arrived in the city.\n\nHe said he has no idea when he will reopen.\n\n“The amount of fear that we have right now is no good,” Betancur said, outside Manolo’s Bakery on Central Avenue, a major hub for the city’s immigrant community.\n\n“It’s not worth it to take that risk,” he said. “We need to protect our families and [prevent] family separation.”\n\nThe bakery was not the only one. Businesses along Central Avenue shut their doors as masked federal agents conducted arrests, prompting anger and anxiety in the community.\n\nPisco Peruvian Gastrolounge posted on Saturday that it would be temporarily closing. “We cannot wait for the moment we can safely welcome you back and continue sharing our culture, our food, and our vibes,” the restaurant shared on Instagram.\n\nFederal immigration officials are preparing to widen their activities in North Carolina, with Raleigh expected to be included in the enforcement effort as soon as Tuesday, the city’s mayor said.\n\nRaleigh Mayor Janet Cowell noted on Monday that she had received no details about how large the operation would be or how long it might last, and immigration authorities have yet to make any public statements.\n\n“I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,” Cowell said in a statement.\n\nRaleigh, with a population of more than 460,000, is North Carolina’s second-largest city after Charlotte, and is part of a region known as the Research Triangle that is home to several leading universities, including Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe possible expansion of immigration raids comes as nationwide detention figures reach historic levels. ICE held 59,762 people in custody as of September 21, 2025, according to TRAC  Reports , a nonpartisan data-gathering platform. This is the highest number of ICE arrests ever recorded. Roughly 71.5 percent of those detained had no criminal conviction, and many of those with convictions had only minor offences, such as traffic violations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/philippine-president-marcos-rejects-sisters-accusation-of-chronic-drug-use","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:45:03+00:00","title":"Philippine President Marcos rejects sister’s accusation of chronic drug use","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has rejected claims by his sister, Senator Imee Marcos, that he has been a long-term cocaine user dating back to their father’s era, dismissing the allegations as baseless and recycled.

rejects sister’s accusation of chronic drug use\n\nPhilippine President  Ferdinand Marcos Jr  has rejected accusations by his estranged sister, Senator Imee Marcos, that he has been a long-term drug user, at a time when the country is witnessing mass protests against corruption.\n\nOn Monday, the senator alleged that her brother had developed a cocaine dependency that affected his governance, contributing to corruption and poor decision-making.\n\nCommunications Undersecretary Claire Castro, the president’s spokesperson, dismissed the claims as baseless, describing them as recycled accusations that have long been disproved.\n\nSpeaking to a large crowd at a Manila park rally organised by a religious group, Senator Imee said her brother’s drug use began during the presidency of their father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr — who ruled from 1965 to 1986 — and continues to this day.\n\nWithout providing evidence, she claimed the president’s addiction became the cause of a “flood of corruption, the lack of direction and very wrong decisions, the absence of accountability and justice”. She also alleged that the president’s wife and children were involved in drug use.\n\nCastro criticised the senator for not addressing former President Rodrigo Duterte, who has acknowledged past fentanyl use and, according to critics, may be linked to corruption along with his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\nWhen Marcos Jr was campaigning for the presidency in 2021, his spokesperson released reports from a private hospital and the national police laboratory showing he tested negative for cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\nCastro has labelled Imee’s statements as a distraction from ongoing investigations into a  corruption scandal  involving flood control projects that may implicate some of her Senate allies.\n\n“Sen Imee, I hope you’ll be a patriot and help in the investigation that your own brother has been doing and condemn all the corrupt,” Castro said. “Don’t side with them, don’t hide them. Let President Marcos work to stop all the corruption.”\n\nMarcos’s administration is investigating alleged corruption linked to ghost flood-control projects that cost taxpayers billions of pesos. Officials are accused of pocketing kickbacks from contracts to construct thousands of flood defences, many of which were either made with substandard materials or never built.\n\nThe Department of Finance estimates that the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2bn) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood-control projects. The country’s economic planning minister has said up to 70 percent of public flood-control funds may have been lost since the scandal surfaced.\n\nThe crisis comes as the Philippines has faced more than 20 storms this year. Most recently, Typhoon Kalmaegi killed at least 269 in early November, followed days later by Typhoon Fung-wong, displacing 1.4 million people and killing 28.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters  gathered in Manila on Sunday, demanding accountability from authorities, including allies of Marcos. The three-day rally organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), or Church of Christ – a powerful Philippine religious group – drew hundreds of thousands of participants and disrupted schools, roads, and offices.\n\nMarcos has promised that officials involved in the scandal would face legal action by the end of the year. “They’ll be jailed – there’s no merry Christmas for them,” he said.\n\nThe INC had endorsed the candidacies of Marcos and Sara Duterte in 2022. However, after a  falling-out  between Marcos and Sara Duterte, the INC has shifted its support towards Duterte, the vice president.\n\nDespite setting up a panel to investigate alleged corruption, no notable arrests have been made nearly 100 days into the inquiry. Marcos, whose father faced accusations of widespread corruption, framed the crackdown as part of a broader campaign for transparency and accountability.\n\nA recent poll from the social research institute Social Weather Stations, however, indicated that more than 80 percent of Metro Manila residents believe corruption has worsened under Marcos’s administration."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/ukraines-zelenskyy-headed-to-turkiye-in-bid-to-resuscitate-peace-talks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"11:33:38+00:00","title":"Ukraine’s Zelenskyy headed to Turkiye in bid to resuscitate peace talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is traveling to Turkiye to revive peace negotiations with Russia, aiming to re-engage the United States and other allies in ceasefire talks.

motion to begin debating his first federal budget – a result that avoids the prospect of a second election in less than a year.\n\nThe House of Commons voted 170-168 to advance study of the fiscal plan. While further votes are expected in the coming months, the slim victory signals that the budget is likely to be approved eventually.\n\nTonight, the House of Commons has voted to pass Budget 2025.\n\nIt’s time to work together to deliver on this plan — to protect our communities, empower Canadians with new opportunities, and build Canada strong.\n\n— Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney)  November 18, 2025\n\n“It’s time to work together to deliver on this plan – to protect our communities, empower Canadians with new opportunities, and build Canada strong,” Carney said on X, arguing that his spending blueprint would help fortify the economy against escalating United States tariffs.\n\nCarney has repeatedly cast the budget as a “generational” chance to reinforce Canada’s economic resilience and to reduce reliance on trade with the US.\n\nThe proposal includes a near doubling of Canada’s deficit to 78.3 billion Canadian dollars ($55.5bn) with major outlays aimed at countering US trade measures and supporting defence and housing initiatives. The prime minister has insisted that higher deficit spending is essential to cushion the impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. While most bilateral trade remains tariff-free under an existing North American trade agreement, US levies on automobiles, steel and aluminium have struck significant sectors of the Canadian economy.\n\nAccording to Carney, a former central banker, internal forecasts show that “US tariffs and the associated uncertainty will cost Canadians around 1.8 percent of our GDP [gross domestic product]”.\n\nThe Liberals, a few seats short of a majority in the 343-seat House of Commons, relied on abstentions from several opposition members who were reluctant to trigger early elections. Recent polling suggested Carney’s Liberals would remain in power if Canadians were sent back to the polls.\n\nCarney was elected to a full term in April after campaigning on a promise to challenge Washington’s protectionist turn. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party, the official opposition, has been wrestling with internal divisions since its defeat, and leader Pierre Poilievre faces a formal review of his performance early next year.\n\nPoilievre has sharply criticised the government’s spending plans, branding the fiscal package a “credit card budget”.\n\nThe left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) has also expressed concerns, arguing that the proposal fails to adequately address unemployment, the housing crisis and the cost-of-living pressures faced by many Canadian families.\n\nNDP interim leader Don Davies said the party accepted that blocking the budget would push the country back into an unwanted election cycle, explaining why two of its MPs ultimately abstained.\n\nIt was “clear that Canadians do not want an election right now … while we still face an existential threat from the Trump administration”, he said.\n\n“Parliamentarians decided to put Canada first”, Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said.\n\nPolling before Monday’s vote suggested Canadians broadly shared this view.

House of Representatives approached a potential vote about  releasing  the Epstein files, President Donald Trump pivoted on the hot-button topic.\n\nTrump and members of his administration had sought to undermine efforts to release the files related to convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein . And Trump has been dismissive of the push to make the files public, calling the case “pretty boring stuff” in July and repeatedly referring to it as a Democratic “ hoax .”\n\nThen, on November 16, he told House Republicans to  vote  in favour of the release.\n\nHis shift came after lawmakers cleared a significant hurdle on November 12, netting 218 signatures on a petition to force a vote on a bill to release the files within 30 days. The House is expected to vote on that bill this week. Previously, it was considered unlikely the legislation would pass in the Senate; it remains to be seen whether Trump’s latest statement will cause senators to reconsider.\n\nEpstein moved in the same social circles as Trump in the  1990s , including attending parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private Palm Beach, Florida, club. The two were photographed together in social settings multiple times. They later had a falling out, a rift that some reporters dated to late 2007.\n\nPalm Beach County prosecutors investigated Epstein after reports that a 14-year-old girl was molested at his mansion. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges related to soliciting prostitution from someone under 18. He received preferential treatment during the criminal investigation and served about a year in jail, largely on work release.\n\nIn 2018, The Miami Herald published an extensive investigation into the case, and the next year, Epstein was arrested on federal charges for recruiting dozens of underage girls to his New York City mansion and Palm Beach estate from 2002 to 2005 to engage in sex acts for money. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, and investigators concluded he died by suicide.\n\nWe asked the White House why Trump changed his stance on releasing the files. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, “President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years – by releasing tens of thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request” and calling for investigations into “Epstein’s Democrat friends”.\n\nHere’s what Trump has said in 2024 and 2025 about releasing the Epstein files.\n\nIn June 2024, Fox and Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy asked Trump if he would declassify various files, including those related to 9/11 and former President John F Kennedy.\n\n“Would you declassify the Epstein files?” Campos-Duffy said.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I would,” Trump said.\n\nThe clip spread on social media, and Trump’s campaign account also shared it.\n\n🚨 President Trump says he will DECLASSIFY the 9/11 Files, JFK Files, and Epstein Files  pic.twitter.com/JalLWFkRDZ\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)  June 3, 2024\n\nDuring the same interview, Trump also said, “I guess I would.” He added, “You don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phoney stuff in there because there is a lot of phoney stuff with that whole world, but I think I would.”\n\nOn a September 2024 episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, during a discussion about releasing some of the Epstein documents, Trump said, “Yeah, I’d certainly take a look at it.” He added that he’d be “inclined” to do it and said, “I’d have no problem with it.”\n\nEarly in the second Trump administration, Trump officials –  including Attorney General  Pam Bondi  and Kash Patel, who became the FBI director – said they supported releasing the files.\n\nIn late February at a White House event, Bondi released what she called the “first phase” of “declassified Epstein files” to conservative influencers. It largely consisted of documents that had already been made public.\n\nIn a July 12 Truth Social post, Trump expressed frustration about the Epstein files. Speaking to reporters on July 15 on the White House lawn, Trump said the files “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\n\nTrump said the FBI should focus on investigating other issues, such as voter fraud, and that his administration should “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about”.\n\nIn a July 16 interview with Real America’s Voice, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I think in the case of Epstein, they’ve already looked at it and they are looking at it and I think all they have to do is put out anything credible. But you know, that was run by the Biden administration for four years.”\n\nOn August 22, a reporter asked Trump if he was in favour of releasing the files.\n\n“I’m in support of keeping it open,” he said. “Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn’t care less. You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be, people – because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don’t know anything about that, but I have said to Pam (Bondi) and everybody else, give them everything you can give them because it’s a Democrat hoax.”\n\nOn September 3, a reporter asked Trump a question about efforts to release the Epstein files and if the Justice Department was protecting any friends or donors.\n\nTrump said it was a “Democrat hoax that never ends” and “we’ve given thousands of pages of files”.\n\nTrump came out in support of releasing the files after it became clear the House was headed in that direction.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee, on November 12, released about 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate.\n\nTrump directed prosecutors to investigate Democrats and told Republicans to vote in favour of releasing the files.\n\nTrump has often noted Epstein’s ties to former President Bill Clinton. In a November 14 Truth Social post, Trump asked the Justice Department to  investigate  Epstein’s involvement with Clinton.\n\nTypically, prosecutors do not release files during an ongoing investigation, so Trump’s announcement raised questions about whether the Justice Department will withhold certain files even if Congress votes to release them.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump on November 14 about releasing the files, he said, “I don’t care about it, released or not.”\n\nTwo days later, in a November 16 post, Trump said, “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’’"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/trump-says-us-may-strike-mexican-drug-cartels-next-after-boat-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:04:57+00:00","title":"Trump says US may strike Mexican drug cartels next, after boat attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has announced the possibility of expanding military strikes against drug cartels into Mexico, following previous actions in the Caribbean and Pacific.

It’s OK with me. I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand,” he told reporters at the Oval Office on Monday. “We’re losing hundreds of thousands of people to drugs. So now we’ve stopped the waterways, but we know every route.”\n\nTrump did not say how or when such strikes could take place. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has previously stated her opposition to any such attacks on her country’s soil.\n\nJeff Garmany, an associate professor of Latin American studies at the University of Melbourne, told Al Jazeera opposition from Mexico City may fall on deaf ears. “There are several legal hurdles standing in the way, some of which are domestic and others of which are international. There are also basic protocols of international diplomacy that, while perhaps not bound by law, are generally respected by UN member states,” he said.\n\n“But nothing about Trump’s second presidency suggests he would adhere to these laws and protocols. So, no, I’d be surprised if Trump would wait for President Sheinbaum’s sign-off if he really wants to carry out strikes in Mexico,” he continued.\n\nTrump’s remarks came two weeks after NBC, quoting two government officials, reported that the White House was preparing for the early stages of a ground operation in Mexico that would be jointly run with US intelligence agencies. The report said the operation would focus on drone strikes against drug labs in Mexico and cartel members.\n\nIn his remarks on Monday at the White House, Trump suggested the US already has a shortlist of targets. “We know every route. We know the addresses of every drug lord,” Trump told reporters. “We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them.”\n\nHe described the situation as “like a war” because cartels were killing “hundreds of thousands” of Americans with drugs like  cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and fentanyl.\n\nGarmany told Al Jazeera that US strikes in Mexico could likely amount to very little due to the strength of the drug cartels there. The Mexican government has itself been embroiled in a long-running and deadly conflict after declaring a “war” on drugs 20 years ago.\n\n“Mexico’s cartels are some of the strongest and most organised criminal organisations in the world. They have extensive resources and occupy a unique geographic position, lying between the US and the rest of Latin America. Carrying out targeted military strikes would be more of a PR stunt than anything else. It won’t stop one of the world’s most lucrative illegal supply chains,” he said.\n\nSince retaking office in January, Trump has used executive orders and legal loopholes to justify military action against drug cartels without the approval of Congress. They include designating six drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations”, which means the White House can justify military strikes as a matter of national security.\n\nSince September, the White House has launched at least 20 strikes on boats that it said were transporting drugs in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 80 people, although it has yet to provide public evidence of their ties to drug cartels like Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe Trump administration says the strikes are a “non-international armed conflict” aimed at “narcoterrorists” and “unlawful combatants”, reviving a controversial concept first coined during President George W Bush’s “war on terror” to justify actions against groups like al-Qaeda."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/18/israels-war-on-gaza-live-hamas-says-un-resolution-does-not-meet-demands","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:43:00+00:00","title":"UN resolution does not meet Palestinians’ rights and demands: Hamas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas and other Palestinian factions have rejected a UN Security Council resolution that supports a Gaza stabilization plan backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, arguing that it fails to meet the political and humanitarian demands of Palestinians, including rights to self-determination and justice.

‘axe murderer’\n\nProsecutors have called for a life sentence for a Sudanese militia leader convicted of committing crimes against humanity during the East African country’s previous civil war more than two decades ago.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened a sentencing hearing for Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman (also known as Ali Kushayb) on Tuesday.\n\nThe previous day, prosecutor Julian Nicholls had demanded the maximum penalty for the “enthusiastic, energetic and effective perpetrator of abuses carried out in the western Darfur region”.\n\nProsecutors say that among his crimes, Abd-Al-Rahman killed two people with an axe.\n\n“You literally have an axe murderer before you,” Nicholls told the judges in The Hague, as Abd-Al-Rahman looked on. “Only a life sentence will serve the interest of retribution and deterrence.”\n\nAbd-Al-Rahman’s defence lawyers, who are asking for a seven-year jail term, will present their case during Tuesday and Wednesday’s hearings.\n\nLast month, Abd-Al-Rahman was  convicted of 27 counts , including mass murders and rapes, for leading government-backed Janjaweed militia forces in the Darfur region in western Sudan on a campaign of killing and destruction from 2003 to 2004.\n\nIt was the first time the ICC had convicted a suspect of crimes in Darfur, a region that is once again seeing mass atrocities amid a  vicious civil war .\n\nAbd-Al-Rahman has consistently denied being a high-ranking official in the Janjaweed militia, a largely Arab paramilitary force armed by the Sudanese government to kill mainly Black African tribes in Darfur.\n\nHe has insisted since the opening of his trial in April 2022 that he is “not Ali Kushayb” and that the court has got the wrong man – an argument rejected by the judges.\n\nAbd-Al-Rahman fled to the Central African Republic in February 2020 when a new Sudanese government announced its intention to cooperate with the ICC’s investigation.\n\nHe said he then handed himself in because he was “desperate” and feared authorities would kill him.\n\nFighting broke out in Sudan’s Darfur region when non-Arab tribes, complaining of systematic discrimination, took up arms against the Arab-dominated government.\n\nKhartoum responded by unleashing the Janjaweed, a force now known as the Popular Defence Forces and drawn from among the region’s nomadic tribes.\n\nThe United Nations says 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million more were displaced in the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.\n\nICC prosecutors are hoping to issue more arrest warrants related to the current crisis in Sudan.\n\nTens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the war between the government-linked Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which traces its origins back to the Janjaweed militia.\n\nThe conflict, marked by claims of atrocities on all sides, has created the  “worst humanitarian crisis in the world” , according to

to meet United States President Donald Trump in his first trip to Washington in eight years.\n\nThe agenda for the MBS-Trump meeting reportedly includes US-Saudi security ties, weapons deals, trade and investment and Trump’s ambition to have Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords and normalise relations with Israel.\n\nThe high-profile visit could shape Saudi-US ties and the region for years to come. Here’s all you need to know:\n\nThe meeting will take place on November 18 in the US capital, Washington, DC.\n\nTrump is reportedly pulling out all the stops to impress the crown prince, with a lavish welcome ceremony to greet him when he steps off the plane.\n\nA sit-down meeting with Trump at the Oval Office tops the agenda, followed by a ceremony where agreements made between the two countries will be signed, and a formal luncheon.\n\nMBS will also speak with members of Congress and American business tycoons who have been invited to the White House, likely at a black-tie dinner in the East Room of the White House on Tuesday evening.\n\nTrade and investment, weapons deals, and defence cooperation, mainly.\n\nTrump announced on Monday, a day before MBS’s arrival, that he would approve the sale of US F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, something the kingdom has long sought.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar deal is reportedly for up to 48 jets and would make Saudi Arabia the first Arab country to own the advanced weapon.\n\nSaudi Arabia has hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US and is expected to announce more on this trip, likely in artificial intelligence and civilian nuclear energy.\n\nBin Salman will likely be seeking security guarantees that Saudi Arabia feels the US has not adequately met, as Israel’s increasing regional aggression, with US support, has put the region on edge.\n\nTrump has prioritised Saudi investments in the US for years, so that is likely to be high on the agenda.\n\nHe also speaks often of wanting Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, a series of Trump-brokered agreements that saw Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates normalise relations with Israel in 2020.\n\nSaudi Arabia has maintained that it would not consider such a move until a credible path to a Palestinian state has been established.\n\nOn Monday night, a US-sponsored resolution passed in the United Nations Security Council that referred to conditions the Palestinian Authority had to fulfil, at the end of which “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.\n\nSaudi-US ties date back nearly a century and are mostly centred around oil and defence.\n\nUS company, Standard Oil of California – later part of Chevron – was the first international company granted exploration rights in Saudi Arabia in 1933, a year after Saudi Arabia’s independence, culminating in the establishment of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco).\n\nIn 1951, the Saudi-US Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement entered into force, outlining US military protection to Saudi Arabia in exchange for a reliable oil supply.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1972, Saudi Arabia’s arms purchases from the US increased from $14.8m to $459m, according to a 1977 report carried out by the US General Accounting Office.\n\nThe spike in weapons sales coincided with a boom in Saudi oil exports, from $655m in 1965 to $26.7bn in 1975, according to the Baker Institute at Rice University.\n\nSaudi weapons purchases from the US have continued to rise, with a commitment this year to buy $142bn worth of arms and defence equipment.\n\nThe close relationship frayed during former US President Joe Biden’s administration, after the assassination of Saudi critic and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. MBS denied ordering the assassination but took responsibility as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader.\n\nBut after Russia invaded Ukraine and fuel prices rose, Biden had an about-face, visiting Saudi Arabia and giving MBS a widely covered fist bump.\n\nIn recent years, Saudi Arabia has diversified trade partners and hedged bets through  closer relations  with China.\n\nBut Trump and MBS have a warm relationship. During Trump’s tour of the Gulf in May, Saudi Arabia announced a $600bn investment in the US.\n\nHowever, Saudi Arabia may still be hedging its bets. In September, shortly after an Israeli attack on Qatar, Saudi Arabia  signed a defence pact  with Pakistan.\n\nThe move was significant because for most of its existence, Saudi Arabia relied heavily on the US for its defence.\n\nTrade between the two countries is soaring in multiple sectors after Saudi Arabia expanded investments and trade with the US to $600bn in January.\n\nAccording to an  official statement and breakdown  from the White House, Saudi Arabia will be investing $20bn in artificial intelligence (AI) and AI data centres in the US.\n\nIn addition, US companies such as Hill International, Jacobs and Parsons have won bids to build huge infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThese projects include the King Salman International Airport as well as other mega infrastructure projects that amount to $2bn.\n\nHowever, Saudi Arabia is still pursuing a comprehensive security pact with the United States, a deal that would require the US to come to the active defence of the kingdom if it is ever threatened.\n\nThis trip signals that Saudi Arabia is welcome in the White House and is an important ally for the Trump administration.\n\nSaudi Arabia is still hedging its bets in terms of security and trade, but the United States remains an important partner and protector for the kingdom.\n\nThe US is unlikely to wrangle normalisation out of the Saudis, while the Saudis may not get the full security agreement they are seeking, either.\n\nHowever, MBS’s visit could have an impact on the Middle East. Trump sees MBS as an ally, and his influence contributed to Trump’s decision to remove sanctions on Syria, meaning MBS could again shift the dial on regional issues such as Palestine, Lebanon and, of course, Syria."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/18/israels-war-on-gaza-live-hamas-says-un-resolution-does-not-meet-demands?update=4114784","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:43:00+00:00","title":"UN resolution does not meet Palestinians’ rights and demands: Hamas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas and other Palestinian factions have rejected a UN Security Council resolution that supports Donald Trump’s Gaza stabilisation plan, arguing that it does not adequately address the political and humanitarian needs of Palestinians.

is tension in the air in  Zaporizhzhia , the southeastern Ukrainian city that straddles both banks of the Dnipro River.\n\nIn recent weeks, the front line on the left, eastern bank, moved closer and is raging about 40km (25 miles) away from the city that also serves as the administrative capital of the Zaporizhia region.\n\nThree-quarters of Zaporizhia have been occupied since 2022, the year Moscow also declared to have officially annexed all of it, along with three more regions – Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson.\n\nRussia has added earth-shattering glide bombs to its arsenal of drones and missiles that keep the city’s 700,000 residents up and afraid at night.\n\nThe heavy bombs, which are out of reach of Ukrainian air defence, can glide for dozens of kilometres and destroy entire apartment buildings.\n\nThe front line itself is more audible.\n\n“It’s louder, we hear it from across the river,” Tetiana, a psychologist whose patients feel increasingly alarmed and depressed, told Al Jazeera.\n\nShe withheld her last name for security reasons.\n\nEven though life in the city seems to go on – swimming pools and medical centres are open, for instance – Tetiana feels that she and her family may have to pack up and flee soon.\n\n“There’s a feeling that maybe at some point we’ll have to leave,” she said. “There’s a readiness.”\n\nMilitary analysts are also far from optimistic.\n\n“[Russia] deployed resources more than a month ago to activate their advance on the western flank,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.\n\nTens of thousands of troops keep advancing, seizing several villages and closing in on the town of Huliaipole in eastern Zaporizhia.\n\nThe town’s name means “a field to walk around” and reflects its centuries-old importance for defending central Ukraine from invaders from the south – mostly nomadic horsemen from the steppes north of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\n\nThese days, Huliaipole serves as a crucial logistical hub – and Russian forces are mere kilometres away.\n\n“The situation became dire, [Russian forces] moved forward and shortened the distance to the town to 4km [2.5 miles], they can even strike it with mortars,” Romanenko said.\n\nOf Huliaipole’s 20,000 residents, only hundreds remain – mostly the elderly who cannot part with their houses, cattle and pets.\n\nWhat helps the Russian advance in Zaporizhia is an open landscape with sparse trees and villages – unlike in Donetsk up north, where Ukraine has well-fortified strongholds on hills and plenty of villages and towns to hold on to, he said.\n\nRussians also use “couriers”, or wheeled robots topped with smoke bombs that create a dense smokescreen – concealing Russian ground forces from Ukrainian reconnaissance drones, he said.\n\nThe fall of Huliaipole may be “fast, possibly without much fighting”, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University.\n\nThe fall “will be a rather strong public-relations blow for Ukrainian forces”, he told Al Jazeera.\n\nMoscow’s forces keep implementing their tactic of narrow, but deep breakthroughs of up to 15km (9.3 miles) into Ukrainian territory wherever they find weak spots in Ukrainian defences, he said.\n\nIf the breakthroughs are not eliminated within days – something that often requires only one regiment of Ukrainian storm troopers and auxiliary drone operators – the front line can be maintained, Mitrokhin believes.\n\nIf not, he said, within a week or two, each breakthrough becomes a front-line curve as Russia starts to deploy drones, mortars and tanks, build trenches, amass manpower and weaponry.\n\nThe problem is not about the lack of Ukrainian reserves but about the slow decision-making by Ukraine’s leaders, top brass and the entire military apparatus, he said.\n\nAfter patching up yet another breakthrough in the north or the east, Ukrainian commanders keep troops on the ground for weeks fighting for hamlets where Russian forces have firmly entrenched.\n\nThe Ukrainians keep losing manpower and resources, while Russians are breaking through elsewhere, he said.\n\n“I’m afraid, with Huliaipole, things will be the same,” Mitrokhin said.\n\nBy mid-December, Huliaipole may be encircled by two-thirds, and then Ukrainian forces will start an operation to save it “with convulsions to save the garrison”, Mitrokhin predicted.\n\n“And yet, what was needed in the beginning was just a deployment of a regiment to a necessary place,” he said.\n\nSome Ukrainian observers agree with him, accusing top Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Syrskii of sluggishness and incompetence.\n\nHuliaipole is “yet another victim [of] the chaos of military management and President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s] desire to keep Syrskii,” lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla wrote on Facebook on Friday. “Say goodbye to the town … It’s being razed to the ground, bypassed from the sides, but soon the fighting will be in Huliaipole itself.”\n\n“In recent weeks, the enemy has significantly sped up its advance and is not going to slow down,” military analyst Konstantin Mashovets wrote on Telegram on Friday.\n\nAnother observer warned of a much larger disaster.\n\n“We’re moving towards a catastrophe of strategic scale that could lead to the loss of our statehood,” Serhiy Sternenko, a popular nationalist blogger, wrote on Telegram on Sunday.\n\nBut according to DeepState, a group of Ukrainian military analysts who verify Moscow’s gains and Kyiv’s losses by geolocating photos and videos, things are not that bad.\n\nRussia currently controls some 19 percent of Ukraine’s territory, a mere percentage point up from the fall of 2022.\n\nThe point cost Moscow tens of thousands of servicemen, according to Western intelligence, amid  economic  pressure caused by Western sanctions and Ukraine’s strikes on oil refineries and military infrastructure."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/18/israels-war-on-gaza-live-hamas-says-un-resolution-does-not-meet-demands?update=4114804","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"05:43:00+00:00","title":"UN

scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix and recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine, has died at the age of 97.

Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41Z","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/18/us-house-votes-on-releasing-epstein-files-what-to-expect","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:06:35+00:00","title":"US House votes on releasing Epstein files: What to expect","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. House of Representatives is voting on releasing all remaining files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender linked to high-profile figures.

expect\n\nThe United States House of Representatives is set to vote on Tuesday to release all the remaining files related to the late accused sex trafficker and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSeveral tranches of files relating to the prosecutions of Epstein –  first  for sexual offences against a minor and later for sex trafficking – have already been released to the public, but many more remain sealed.\n\nEpstein was known for socialising with celebrities and politicians and the content of these files has become a source of huge speculation in the US – not least among US President Donald Trump’s own MAGA support base.\n\nTuesday’s vote was scheduled after Trump,  shifting his position  on the issue, urged House Republicans to vote in favour of releasing the documents.\n\nHere is what we know about the upcoming  House vote .\n\nAccording to the website of House majority leader, Republican Steve Scalise, the House will convene on Tuesday at 10am (15:00 GMT). The first votes are expected to take place at 2pm (19:00 GMT) and the last votes are expected at 8:15pm (01:15 GMT on Wednesday).\n\nThe House is voting on this bill now because Trump said he will not veto it if it passes in Congress.\n\nLate on Sunday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “We have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.”\n\nOn Monday, Trump doubled down, telling a reporter in the Oval Office that he would sign the bill if it got through the Senate. “Sure, I would. Let the Senate look at it. Let anyone look at it, but don’t talk about it too much,” he said.\n\nThis is a  divergence from Trump’s earlier position  on the Epstein files. Trump has previously called the Epstein files a “Democratic hoax” and advised Republicans not “to fall for it”.\n\nOn November 12, during the recent 43-day  government shutdown , Trump posted on Truth Social: “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”\n\nYes. While some agreed with Trump’s earlier stance that the Epstein files were a distraction by the Democrats, many Republicans have joined the Democrats in pushing for all of them to be made public.\n\nOn November 12, Democrats and some Republicans gathered 218 signatures in favour of releasing the files within 30 days, enough to force a floor vote on a bill.\n\nOn the same day,  email records  from Epstein’s estate were released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which has been charged with investigating Epstein. Some of these mentioned Trump’s name, and some emails gave the impression that Trump had known about Epstein’s sexual misconduct with young girls – something he denies.\n\nRepublicans on the committee said Democrats had “cherry-picked” information, deliberately painting Trump in a bad light. So, in turn, they released 20,000 documents from Epstein’s estate, they said, to provide balance. Many of the Republican documents also mention Trump, but generally in relation to his political career rather than about any misconduct.\n\nThe Republicans who have joined the Democrats in pushing for a bill to release all records relating to Epstein are Thomas Massie of Kentucky,  Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia , Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Massie was the sponsor of the bill alongside Democrat Ro Khanna of California. They first introduced the discharge bill in July.\n\nA simple majority of 218 votes is required to pass a measure in the House, where there are currently 219 Republicans, 214 Democrats and two empty seats.\n\nThe Epstein documents began to create a rift among the Republican party in July when the Justice Department and the FBI released a memo stating that a government review had found no evidence that Epstein had a specific “secret client list”.\n\nThat memo also reaffirmed that Epstein had died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell – another focus of great speculation online in the US.\n\nThis angered right-wing activists and influencers who have pushed conspiracy theories that Epstein did not actually die by suicide, but was instead silenced by unknown people. Attorney General Pam Bondi also  came under fire  for appearing to state earlier that a list of Epstein clients was sitting “on her desk”.\n\nEpstein was a millionaire financier born and raised in New York who was known for socialising with celebrities and politicians.\n\nHe was accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 2005 after her parents reported it to the police. The police interviewed other girls who made similar allegations.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor in relation to a single victim. He spent 13 months in prison on a work-release programme, which allowed him to leave jail to go to work during the day and return at night. In 2019, federal prosecutors charged him with sex trafficking, but he  died  by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell before that case could be heard.\n\nThe US attorney in Manhattan also prosecuted Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was accused of being Epstein’s  co-conspirator  in his sexual abuse scheme. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is currently serving a  20-year prison sentence  that she received in 2022.\n\nTrump and Epstein were  friends  in the 1980s,1990s and early 2000s, when they mingled in the same social circles and attended the same parties.\n\nIn 2004, the two fell out over a foreclosed oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach. The Washington Post reported that Trump had outbid Epstein on the property. Since that date, there has been sparse public evidence of the two men interacting.\n\nIn January 2024, about  950 pages of court documents  associated with Epstein’s prosecutions were publicised. These  documents  contained accounts by Epstein’s victims saying that they saw prominent figures, including musicians, academics and politicians, in Epstein’s company, from Michael Jackson to  Bill Clinton .\n\nThe mention of someone’s name in these testimonies does not mean that they are guilty of any wrongdoing – only that they were seen in the company of Epstein or were somehow linked to him or people he knew. Trump was mentioned in these documents, but not accused of anything.\n\nThere was no sign of an Epstein “client list” and rumours of the existence of this have continued to mount.\n\nThis year, The Wall Street Journal published a letter, allegedly written by Trump to Epstein on his birthday in 2003. The letter, which Trump denies writing, featured a drawing of a woman’s breasts and was signed “Donald”. In July, Trump launched a $10bn lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal’s parent company Dow Jones and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over the story.\n\nIn a 2011 email – one of those released by Democrats last week – Epstein told Maxwell that Trump had “spent hours” at his house with one victim, whose name had been redacted from the release by the Democrats.\n\nHowever, in the  documents  cache released by the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, the name is shown as  Virginia Giuffre , who sued disgraced Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (formerly Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom, before he was stripped of his royal titles last month) for rape and sexual assault before she died by suicide in April this year.\n\nThe White House then confirmed the victim was Giuffre in a  statement  sent to US media on November 12.\n\nMassie told US media on Sunday that “there could be 100 or more” votes from Republicans in favour of releasing all the remaining files relating to Epstein. “I’m hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote.”\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he also believes the House will reliably back the bill.\n\n“We’ll just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has also flip-flopped his position on releasing the Epstein files, however. In July, he called for the Justice Department to release all its files on Epstein. However, later that month, he cut a House session short to avoid a vote on the release. Last month, he said he would not block a vote on making the files public.\n\nKhanna has also voiced hopes that Republicans will back the bill, but his estimates were more modest than Massie’s. He expects some 40 Republicans to do so.\n\nIf the House passes the vote on Tuesday, it will move to the Senate for approval. Once passed by the Senate, it will go to Trump for his signature."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1211-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-11:11","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of science and technology developments, including a G4 geomagnetic storm alert from the U.S. weather agency, Amazon's recent layoffs, and false public health claims by former President Trump.

trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0vekq12ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:20:53.664+00:00","title":"Brazil creates new Indigenous territories during protest-hit COP30","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brazil has announced the creation of 10 new Indigenous territories during COP30, including one overlapping with the Amazon National Park, to protect Indigenous cultures and ecosystems.

by protests in recent days.\n\nThe designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.\n\nThe move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree.\n\nIt comes as thousands have protested at the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\".\n\nEarlier last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security.\n\nSecurity around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.\n\nMore than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\".\n\nPast recognition of Indigenous reserves  banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming , in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation.\n\nExpanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.\n\nThe new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.\n\nOne area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.\n\nThe Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.\n\nUntil the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.\n\nUnder his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.\n\nLula's government  has previously taken action  to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.\n\nCurrently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory.\n\nHundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is already at risk  of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.\n\nCarbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.\n\nCountries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C.\n\nThe UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has announced a ban on children under 16 from accessing major social media platforms, including Reddit, Kick, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube, effective December 10, 2025.

under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3eplgwdwdko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"22:52:18.501+00:00","title":"Will Trump's tariff rollback lower food prices?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration recently rolled back tariffs on key food items like coffee, spices, and bananas, signaling a shift toward addressing cost-of-living concerns that have impacted public approval and election outcomes.

rollback lower food prices?\n\nWhen President Donald Trump last week removed tariffs on more than 200 products, it represented something of a political earthquake, and marked a significant concession on a hallmark White House policy\n\nThe decision, which critics said was long overdue, came as the president returned his attention to cost-of-living issues, after polls suggested affordability concerns were weighing down White House approval ratings and hurting Republican candidates in recent elections.\n\nA top lobby group for the food industry, FMI, the Food Industry Association, hailed the tariff rollback, which affected popular items like bananas and coffee, as a \"critical step\" toward affordability, as other business groups also praised the move.\n\nBut in the end, the practical relief may not feel as monumental as the political gesture.\n\nIn October, the Budget Lab at Yale projected that Trump's tariffs this year - currently a baseline tax of 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would drive up food prices 1.9% in the short run.\n\nThe impact would be significant, given that US grocery prices historically have been relatively stable, rising an average of only 2% a year between 2013 and 2021.\n\nThe White House order did not eliminate tariffs on all food, but it removed levies on some items, such as coffee, spices and tropical fruit like bananas, for which US production is negligible or non-existent.\n\nFor those kinds of goods, economists and businesses said they expected the order would help bring down prices - and relatively quickly.\n\nAnthony Serafino, president of the New Jersey-based fruit importer and distributor EXP Group, said he expected to drop his prices in the coming weeks, after raising them earlier this year to cover millions of dollars in new tariff costs.\n\nHe said it might take a few weeks for shoppers to see the difference, since he has to sell items he brought in before the change. But he expected the decision to be a \"big help\".\n\n\"We were just passing through costs. We're not going to keep prices elevated just to keep prices elevated,\" he said.\n\nThe overall impact on household grocery budgets, however, may still end up feeling relatively modest.\n\nThough the US is heavily dependent on foreign supplies in certain categories, such as fresh fruit and seafood, imports typically account for less than 20% of overall food and beverage purchases by Americans, according to USDA.\n\nAnd many food imports from Mexico - America's single biggest foreign food supplier - were already spared tariffs, due to White House exemptions for goods covered by a US, Mexico and Canada free trade agreement.\n\n\"You will certainly see it on certain products,\" said Sean Cash, a professor of food economics at Tufts University.  \"I don't think we're going to see a lot in terms of the average price of groceries coming down.\"\n\nFood companies are still facing higher costs from tariffs on materials like aluminium, used to make canned foods; items like wine, cheese and palm oil did not make the list.\n\nRecent jumps in food prices also reflect factors unrelated to tariffs, like rising labour costs and droughts, which hit coffee and cattle supplies.\n\n\"If we got rid of trade barriers on food items and food commodities, would that make food cheaper in the US? Yes, a little bit, but not that much, because most of what we're buying are services,\" said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, noting costs like border inspections, washing, trucking fees and supermarket workers.\n\nOverall, grocery prices climbed 2.7% over the 12 months to September.\n\nThat is still significantly lower than the huge jumps in 2022 and 2023, when grocery prices surged 11.4% and 5% respectively.\n\nTrump administration officials have cast high food prices as a mess they inherited from the Biden administration, and warned it will take time to correct the problem.\n\nIn a briefing for reporters last week about new tariff exemptions, they acknowledged the effects might be limited, saying reducing prices in grocery aisles was the goal and not a guarantee.\n\nWalmart, Target and Kroger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFood prices tend to fluctuate more than other kinds of goods, meaning some relief is likely, especially given attention on the issue, economists said.\n\nBut Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Canada, warned today's high prices are likely to inform future decisions, comparing the dynamic to the \"tide\".\n\n\"The tide goes up, it leaves a mark on the dock and that line remains,\" he said. \"If tariffs disappear, you will see that mental mark remaining and industry tends to work with that mark.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has clarified that planned nuclear tests are 'noncritical' and will not involve nuclear explosions, countering claims by President Donald Trump that the U.S. would restart explosive nuclear weapon testing.

2025-11-03T12:27:39+00:00\n\nTitle: How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with over 5,000 cases and two deaths reported across all provinces and territories.

Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"02:03:30.771+00:00","title":"Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN Security Council has approved a US-drafted resolution endorsing Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, marking a significant diplomatic step.

of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.\n\nIncluded   in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute.\n\nThe resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.\n\nAdopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire\", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands.\n\nThe Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\n\n\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.\n\nUnder the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.\n\nUntil now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.\n\nMike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".\n\nThe Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.\n\nFinancing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution.\n\nUnder the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.\n\nTrump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board.\n\n\"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nUnlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.\n\nIsrael strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.\n\nThe UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution\".\n\nThe US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".\n\nRussia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.\n\nBoth Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.\n\nThe initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".\n\nTrump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.\n\nMore than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"23:01:18.831+00:00","title":"A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since 2000, China has invested $2.1 trillion globally in both developing and wealthy nations, with state-backed financial institutions directly funding strategic acquisitions in sensitive sectors such as semiconductors and intelligence services.

2025-11-17T23:01:18.831+00:00\n\nTitle: A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree\n\nSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.\n\nBut the rules weren't always so strict.\n\nIn 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\n\n\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"\n\nIn 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.\n\nUS concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.\n\nWright USA wasn't an isolated case.\n\nThe BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.\n\nBut on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"\n\nThe Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.\n\nStein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.\n\nFosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nHigh-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.\n\nVery few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\n\n\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"\n\nAidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.\n\nA four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the  first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.\n\nAidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.\n\n\"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds.\n\nThat size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\n\n\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"\n\nSome of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.\n\nIn it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year.\n\nBeijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.\n\nGlobal alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\n\n\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"\n\nAt a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.\n\nAidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how  the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company .\n\nThe United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.\n\nAidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\n\n\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"\n\nHowever, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\n\n\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\n\n\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"\n\nChina's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.\n\nIn the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.\n\nIt shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.\n\nNexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.\n\nThat bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.\n\nNexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions.\n\nThe company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.\n\nXiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\n\n\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"\n\nXiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\n\n\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says.\n\n\"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"\n\nIf China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\n\n\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\n\n\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot.\n\n\"They're going to move from defence to offence.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8drzv37z4jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:37:33.989+00:00","title":"Don't blindly trust what AI tells you, Google boss tells BBC","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (parent company of Google), warns that people should not blindly trust AI tools, emphasizing that current AI models are prone to errors.

trust what AI tells you, Google boss tells BBC\n\nPeople should not \"blindly trust\" everything AI tools tell them, the boss of Google's parent company Alphabet has told the BBC.\n\nIn an exclusive interview , chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are \"prone to errors\" and urged people to use them alongside other tools.\n\nMr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology.\n\n\"This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate

reliable.\n\nWhile AI tools were helpful \"if you want to creatively write something\", Mr Pichai said people \"have to learn to use these tools for what they're good at, and not blindly trust everything they say\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.\"\n\nThe company displays disclaimers on its AI tools to let users know they can make mistakes.\n\nBut this has not shielded it from criticism and concerns over errors made by its own products.\n\nGoogle's rollout of AI Overviews summarising its search results was marred by criticism and mockery  over some erratic, inaccurate responses .\n\nThe tendency for generative AI products, such as chatbots, to relay misleading or false information, is a cause of concern among experts.\n\n\"We know these systems make up answers, and they make up answers to please us - and that's a problem,\" Gina Neff, professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"It's okay if I'm asking 'what movie should I see next', it's quite

awaiting the latest launch of Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT.\n\nFrom May this year, Google began introducing a new \"AI Mode\" into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot which is  aimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert .\n\nAt the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a \"new phase of the AI platform shift\".\n\nThe move is also part of the tech giant's bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google's online search dominance.\n\nHis comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answers  contained \"significant inaccuracies \".\n\nIn his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects.\n\nFor Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being \"bold and responsible at the same time\".\n\n\"So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,\" he said.\n\nThe tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added.\n\n\"For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,\" he said.\n\nAsked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI's founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI \"dictatorship\", Mr Pichai said \"no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI\".\n\nBut he added there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today.\n\n\"If there was only one company which was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p3x7vr34o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"03:54:09.273+00:00","title":"Shelters plea for Gazans as winter rains raise fears of more disease and death","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on an urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza as winter rains exacerbate existing conditions, with over 260,000 families lacking basic shelter.

death\n\nAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\n\n\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\n\n\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"\n\nWith a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.\n\nThey have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday.\n\nThere are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\n\n\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\n\n\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"\n\nThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\n\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.\n\nHer family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.\n\n\"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"\n\nA recent UN report found that across Gaza  more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City .\n\nAccording to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.\n\nThe NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.\n\nThey say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.\n\nJan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up.\n\nIn March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.\n\nHowever, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.\n\nMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.\n\nCogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\".\n\nIt said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\".\n\nOn Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"\n\nIt said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".\n\nInternational aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.\n\nWith a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\n\n\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.\n\n\"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"\n\nPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.\n\nThey say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.\n\nThere are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\n\n\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\n\n\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\n\nIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.\n\nHe said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\n\n\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"\n\nLike all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\n\n\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"\n\nCorrection 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza.

The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.\n\nSummers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.\n\nClinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.\n\nThe department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.\n\nHoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted \"any association\" it had with Epstein, and added that it \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".\n\nTrump was  also mentioned in the emails , which do not imply any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\n\n\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"\n\nThe emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".\n\nIn a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".\n\nDue to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\" and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".\n\nA representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein\" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity.

airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear.\n\nTens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nOn Sunday the US military confirmed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, had arrived in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Trump administration argues the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US.\n\nThey have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region.\n\nPresident Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets.\n\nIn a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".\n\nBut little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon.\n\nIn at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year.\n\nIt is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.\n\nThe US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.\n\nBBC Verify has identified 15 warships in the region based on ship-tracking data, satellite imagery and announcements by US authorities.\n\nThis includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".\n\nThe deployment also includes a range of guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops.\n\nAdditionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that he authorised  the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela , although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.\n\nBetween 2 September and 16 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific.\n\nThe majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nUS Southern Command announced on Sunday that its latest strike, conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board.\n\n\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Southern Command wrote in a post on X, alongside a video showing the boat exploding in a massive fireball.\n\nCollectively, at least 83 people have been killed.\n\nWhile US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\".\n\nOne investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss.\n\nThe Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.\n\nIn a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".\n\nBut some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that  he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity .\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.\n\nIn October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\n\n\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"\n\nThe build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially to try to topple the left-wing socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOn 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered.\n\nAsked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nThe Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.\n\nIn response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country.\n\nMaduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace.\n\n\"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Edgington"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l1zxekp3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"00:18:39.700+00:00","title":"Is phubbing ruining your relationship?

Here's how to fix it\n\nWe all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.\n\nThat's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.\n\nThis can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.\n\nRather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.\n\nDr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.\n\nEvery time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.\n\nIt sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr  tells Woman's Hour  that this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.\n\nWhat matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"\n\nBy naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\n\n\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\n\n\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"\n\nDoing this could help improve your relationships too.\n\nDr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton,  led a study  which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\n\n\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\n\n\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"\n\nEvery time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd0m874g05o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"01:32:24.793+00:00","title":"Bihar: India's politicians are dishing out election freebies - but are they affordable?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In India, political parties—including those led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi—are increasingly relying on election freebies, such as cash handouts to women, to secure voter support.

freebies - but are they affordable?\n\nFreebies are powering election victories in India, but can its states afford them?\n\nOver the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to  bicycles  and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.\n\nIn recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.\n\nA sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of  Bihar  - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.\n\nSimilar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.\n\nEconomists like  Jean Drèze  have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.\n\nOn the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023.\n\nWhile there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.\n\nAccording to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nDespite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development.\n\nIt is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.\n\n\"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.\n\nSome estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have  crossed  this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.\n\nThe fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.\n\nIndia's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.\n\nAccording to the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) , while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.\n\n\"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.\n\n\"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\"\n\nThis warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.\n\nBut with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.\n\n\"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:38:40.202+00:00","title":"When is the Epstein files vote - and why does Trump now say he wants them released?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has reversed his earlier opposition to releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, urging Republicans in Congress to vote in favor of a House bill that would require the Justice Department to make all Epstein-related records—potentially including those involving Ghislaine Maxwell and government officials—public within 30 days.

say he wants them released?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has urged Republicans in Congress to vote to release more files relating to Jeffrey Epstein - a sudden reversal in his position after having previously opposed efforts to make the documents public.\n\nTrump had been facing a potential revolt after a growing number of Republicans signalled they would vote in favour of releasing the files despite his opposition.\n\nWhile the measure is likely to pass in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, it is far from certain that it would pass in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nAnd even if it does pass in the Senate, it remains unclear when the files could be released and whether they would satisfy ardent campaigners.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on a measure that would compel the justice department to make publicly available \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" all files pertaining to Epstein within 30 days.\n\nProcedural votes and debates are expected to begin at 10:00EST (15:00GMT) and continue for many hours.\n\nSeveral victims of Epstein are also expected to spend the day on Capitol Hill, to advocate for the bill's passage and to hold news conferences with reporters.\n\nThe releases could, in theory, also include files pertaining to imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as people - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.\n\nThe vote will come just  two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure . In the post, he argued that \"we have nothing to hide\".\n\nThe measure is likely to pass. Even before Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour.\n\nShould it pass, it still faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is under no obligation to even pick up the measure.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune will do so - but the Republican is under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum.\n\nHe had previously suggested that while he was \"not hearing\" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that.\n\n\"I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,\" Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie told ABC News over the weekend.\n\nAnother Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, only told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Senate will \"take a look\" at the bill if it passes the House.\n\n\"We'll see what it says,\" Barrasso said. \"We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.\"\n\n\"This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,\" he added. \"And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"\n\nOnly after the Senate passes the bill would it head to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.\n\nSpeking to reporters on Monday night, he said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\". \"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he claimed. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"\n\nTrump went on to argue the Epstein scandal was a \"hoax\" distracting from \"the greatness of what the Republican Party had accomplished over the last period of time\".\n\nThere are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill.\n\nThe text of the document that will go before the House, for example, notes that the attorney general could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\n\n\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\n\n\"There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,\" he added.\n\nThe proposed House bill also notes that the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\".\n\nThat could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump said in his post that he would be calling for an investigation into Epstein's alleged links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\n\n\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Prof Entin said. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\"\n\nDoing so, he added, \"might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation\" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought.\n\nFor those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in a public row with Trump over the files, told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,\" Greene added. \"But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"12:16:04.197+00:00","title":"Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, acknowledges that while AI investment has been extraordinary, there are 'elements of irrationality' in the current boom, drawing comparisons to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.

2025-11-18T12:16:04.197+00:00\n\nTitle: Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality'\n\nEvery company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom.\n\nIt comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry.\n\nAsked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning.\n\n\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" he said.\n\nIn a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment,  the accuracy of his AI models , and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs.\n\nThe interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense.\n\nAlphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI.\n\nA particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation.\n\nAs valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment.\n\nIt has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed.\n\nThis led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.\n\nIn comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of \"irrational exuberance\" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can \"overshoot\" in investment cycles like this.\n\n\"We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,\" he said.\n\n\"I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\n\nHis comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry  would \"probably be lost\" .\n\nBut Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own \"full stack\" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was  investing in UK artificial intelligence , committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years.\n\nMr Pichai said Alphabet will develop \"state of the art\" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London.\n\nFor the first time, he said Google would \"over time\" take a step that is being pushed for in government to \"train our models\" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI \"superpower\" after the US and China.\n\n\"We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,\" Mr Pichai said.\n\nHowever, he also warned about the \"immense\" energy needs of AI, which made up  1.5% of the world's electricity consumption last year , according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure.\n\n\"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,\" he said.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies.\n\n\"The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,\" he said.\n\nAI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it \"the most profound technology\" humankind had worked on.\n\n\"We will have to work through societal disruptions,\" he said, adding that it would also \"create new opportunities\".\n\n\"It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,\" he said. Those who do adapt to AI \"will do better\".\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

an early election.\n\nThe fiscal plan, which raises Canada's deficit to a projected C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), was passed thanks to crucial support from   opposition MPs, including Green Party leader Elizabeth May.\n\nMany opposition lawmakers have sharply criticised the fiscal plan - the second largest in history. The plan passed with 170 votes in favour and 168 against.\n\nCarney, who served as the former central banker for both Canada and the UK, has defended the budget as a \"generational investment\" to help Canada strengthen its economy.\n\nThe vote was crucial for Carney's Liberal government, which currently sits two seats short of a majority.\n\nIt meant that if all 169 Liberal MPs voted in support, the budget would need the backing from either two opposition MPs, or have four opposition MPs abstain.\n\nTwo NDP MPs abstained along with House Speaker Francis Scarpaleggia, who casts a vote in the event of a tie. Conservative MPs Shannon Stubbs and Matt Jeneroux  - who announced earlier this month that he was resigning - also abstained.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May's support also proved crucial. May told reporters she voted in favour of the plan based on commitments made by Carney that he would support Canada's climate targets.\n\n\"Without what I heard from the prime minister today, I would have voted no,\" she said.\n\nThe Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, and the Quebec nationalist bloc Québécois both voted against the budget, accusing Carney's government of failing to address affordability concerns.\n\nPoilievre labelled the budget a \"credit card budget\", arguing it did little to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"The prime minister's costly deficit gambles our future on the national credit card,\" Poilievre said in the House of Commons on Monday ahead of the vote.\n\nLiberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who supported the budget, raised concerns of his own, suggesting that while the plan offered much-needed investment, it fell short in addressing Canada's housing crisis and stalled progress on climate action.\n\nThe budget proposes C$140bn of new spending over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\".\n\nIt includes money to update ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade.\n\nAdditionally, the plan allocates direct support for businesses hurt by US tariffs on Canadian goods, with Carney's government projecting the initiatives will attract C$1tn in private sector investment over the next five years.\n\nTo balance the fiscal plan, Carney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10% over the coming years - a move that has drawn strong criticism from public sector employees, who cautioned that a leaner federal workforce would slow government operations.\n\nThe budget was first put forward in early November and has already survived two votes.\n\nDebate around it had been partially eclipsed by partisan drama between Carney's Liberals and the Conservative opposition, who lost a member of their caucus to the Liberals shortly after the fiscal plan was proposed.\n\nChris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia said he defected over what he believed was Poilievre's \"negative\" style of politics. He added that the Liberal budget \"hits the priorities\" of his constituents.\n\nAnother Conservative lawmaker, Matt Jeneroux of Alberta, later resigned from parliament that same week, saying he did so to spend more time with family.\n\nThe departures fuelled questions about Poilievre's leadership. On Wednesday, he told reporters that he planned to stay on as leader.\n\n\"My plan is to continue to lead and be the only leader that's fighting for an affordable Canada where our people who work hard can afford a home and food,\" Poilievre said."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17pj0gr75lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"00:32:33.387+00:00","title":"KPop Demon Hunters star on how her life mirrored main character Rumi's journey","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Arden Cho, the voice actress behind the character Rumi in Netflix’s animated film KPop Demon Hunters, shares how her own journey as an Asian-American growing up in Texas—marked by struggles with identity, cultural alienation, and racism—mirrored the character’s internal conflict.

because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.\n\nIn the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\n\n\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.\n\nThese were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\n\n\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\n\n\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"\n\nWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.\n\nCho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\n\n\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.\n\nBut the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\n\n\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.\n\nSo, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.\n\nThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, which sparked protests in many states.\n\nAs an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"\n\nKorean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.\n\nAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\n\n\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.\n\nBecause of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\n\n\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"\n\nThe growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.\n\nCho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\n\n\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"\n\nKPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.\n\nCho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\n\n\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp97ggrnn35o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"06:10:18.136+00:00","title":"Major AI project to tackle drug-resistant superbugs","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK is launching a £45 million artificial intelligence (AI)-driven project, led by the Fleming Initiative and pharmaceutical company GSK, to combat the rising threat of drug-resistant superbugs.

superbugs \n\nThe UK is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle the rising numbers of infections that have become resistant to treatment.\n\nThe project - a collaboration between the Fleming Initiative and the pharmaceutical company GSK - is a battle between superbugs and supercomputers.\n\nIt aims to speed up the discovery of fresh antibiotics and deliver new ways of killing other threats, including deadly fungal infections.\n\nOverusing antibiotics drives bacteria to evolve resistance to infections, which means new drugs are a priority.\n\nDrug-resistant infections are a growing problem – one known as \"the silent pandemic\".\n\nSuperbugs are now thought to directly kill around  one million people a year  worldwide and contribute to the deaths of millions more. Those figures are predicted to continue to grow.\n\nThe collaboration will spend £45m on six fields of research.\n\n\"This represents the single biggest investment in a UK antibiotic project I'm aware of,\" says Dr Andrew Edwards from Imperial College London.\n\nHe will be targeting AI at a tricky group of infections, called Gram-negative bacteria, that includes well known bugs such as  E. coli  and  Klebsiella pneumoniae .\n\nThese species have an extra outer layer they use to control what gets in and out of a bacterium. Gram-negative species can block antibiotics from getting in and rapidly pump out those that penetrate the bacterial defences – making them tough to treat.\n\nThe team will be performing experiments using molecules with different chemical structures and recording what can get inside and stay inside these bacteria.\n\nThis data will then be fed into the AI so it can learn what it takes for an antibiotic to persist inside a Gram-negative bacterium.\n\n\"The sort of AI that people are using routinely today is built on the sum total of information on the internet - it doesn't just produce answers out of thin air,\" Dr Edwards told the BBC.\n\n\"If you want to make progress, you have to have data,\" he says.\n\nThe aim is to convert years of research, if done by hand, into a simple job for a computer.\n\nThen once the chemical code has been cracked, it will guide scientists on how to modify potential antibiotics to bypass the organism's defences.\n\nDr Edwards said there were cases coming out of the conflict in Ukraine now where infections could not be treated with any antibiotic.\n\n\"That means that limbs have to be amputated. I would say it's a glimpse into the future, but it's happening right now, it's a pretty horrific thought.\"\n\nSo can AI outpace bacterial evolution?\n\n\"That's a very good question, I think what we've seen is that if we can get a few good antibiotics, then we'll be back on on the front foot and then I think we can keep things in check,\" says Dr Edwards.\n\nThe Fleming Initiative is named after Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928 and started the antibiotic age.\n\nEven by the time he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 80 years ago,  he had warned of the dangers of resistance .\n\nAlison Holmes, the director of the Fleming Initiative, said antibiotics were \"one of the greatest health resources that has been squandered\" and we should all think of how much we owe to antibiotics.\n\n\"Whether it's that time we stepped on a nail and or got cellulitis following an insect bite or our C-section wound, or our UTI, or our STI - we all depend on them,\" she said.\n\nThe collaboration will also use AI like a weather forecast to predict how superbugs emerge and spread.\n\nAnd the project is also looking beyond bacteria to use AI to tackle the rise of deadly fungal infections, starting with Aspergillus mould.\n\nIts spores are normally harmless, but can become deadly in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nTony Wood, the chief scientific officer at GSK, said: \"We will open up new approaches for the discovery of novel antibiotics as well as anticipate and outpace the development of resistance to transform the treatment and prevention of serious infections.\"\n\nResearchers in the US and Canada have already started using AI to shortlist drugs or even design antibiotics from scratch to target drug-resistant bacteria like gonorrhoea.\n\nData for the UK  suggests nearly 400 new antibiotic-resistant infections are being detected every week."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7erx7440mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:24:06.025+00:00","title":"Trump: India's US exports jump despite 50% tariffs as trade tensions ease","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"India's goods exports to the US rose 14.5% in October, marking the first increase in five months despite the continuation of 50% US tariffs.

US and Trump exempted many  farm goods  from reciprocal tariffs that could benefit India.\n\nTrade deal negotiations between the two countries are under way, with an Indian  official  saying that key

October, erasing more than $2.5bn in monthly export value,\" Mr Srivastava added.\n\nBut trade tensions between the two countries appear to be gradually letting up after months of uncertainty.\n\nOn Monday, India said it had concluded a first-ever major deal that will see its state-run oil companies sourcing some 10% of the country's annual LPG needs from the US.\n\nPetroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri described the decision as a \"historic development\" and said the world's largest and fastest growing LPG market has now opened up to the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has been urging Delhi to ramp up its purchase of US petroleum products and reduce its dependency on Russian oil.\n\nIndia became one of the biggest markets for Russian oil as Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow after the Ukraine war started in 2022.\n\nLast year, India bought $52.7bn of Russian crude -  37% of its oil bill  - but Trump has reiterated time and again, that the country has agreed to reduce its purchases, something India has not officially confirmed.\n\nDelhi is walking a diplomatic tightrope on energy imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit Delhi early next month to finalise several agreements and projects, local reports say.\n\nYet trade talks between India and the US - stalled for months over Delhi's refusal to cut Russian oil imports - now appear to be moving quickly despite this.\n\nOn Monday, a senior government official told The Hindu newspaper that the  first phase of the trade deal  is \"more or less near closure\".\n\nIndia is also set to benefit from the US's decision to roll back reciprocal tariffs on certain agricultural products such as tea, coffee and spices - a move that,  analysts say , would effectively exempt about $1bn worth of India's agricultural exports to the US from duties.\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   Twitter  and  Facebook

is Marshall B Mathers III – filed a petition to the US Patent and Trademark Office, calling for it to cancel a trademark that was granted to the company. US law requires the company  to respond to the petition by next week.\n\nThe 53-year-old rapper's lawyers accused the Sydney-based brand of creating a \"false association\" with Eminem.\n\nSwim Shady told the BBC in a statement that it would \"defend our valuable intellectual property\".\n\nThe company's name was registered in September 2023, according to Australia's business regulator, having originally launching under the name Slim Shade. It officially launched in 2024.\n\nThe brand sells portable beach umbrellas, swim bags and other beach accessories.\n\nEarlier this year, the brand filed a trademark in the US for the term \"Swim Shady\", which was granted. Shortly afterwards, Eminem's team filed a petition to cancel the trademark.\n\nEminem has also filed an opposition to the brand's name in Australia.\n\n\"Swim Shady is a grass roots Australian company that was born out of a desire to produce stylish and effective sun shades and other items to protect from the harsh Australian sun,\" the company said, adding that it could not comment further due to the ongoing legal case.\n\nCourt documents show Eminem trademarked the name Slim Shady in the US in 1999 with the release of the eponymous album. However, he only filed a trademark for the Slim Shady name in Australia in January 2025.\n\nEminem shot into fame in 2000 with the release of his hit single The Real Slim Shady, which earned him a Grammy for best rap solo performance.\n\nHis lawyers said the name has become \"distinctive and famous\" and exclusively associated with his rap career.\n\nSydney intellectual property legal specialist firm Meyer West IP is listed as Swim Shady's legal representative.\n\nLast year, an Australian court overturned an earlier ruling that  US pop star Katy Perry infringed on the trademark of Australian designer Katie Perry .\n\nThe Australian designer sold clothes under her birth name and had accused the California Girls singer of trademark infringement when she sold merchandise during her 2014 Australian tour.\n\nKatie Perry compared the legal clash at the time to a David and Goliath showdown."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j86xydjpro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"07:23:07.874+00:00","title":"Australian murderer sues for right to Vegemite behind bars","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A convicted Australian murderer, Andre McKechnie, is challenging a 2006 ban on Vegemite in Victorian prisons, claiming the restriction denies him the right to enjoy his Australian cultural identity.

a property developer to death in Queensland in the 1990s.

ever\", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.\n\nThe miniature two-storey thatched cottage was  gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932  by the people of Wales.\n\nIt was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.\n\nBut with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?\n\nY Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.\n\nDesigned by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.\n\nIt was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.\n\nIt even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.\n\n\"It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,\" said historian Dr Elin Jones.\n\n\"It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,\" said Dr Jones.\n\nAt the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.\n\nCustody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.\n\nPrincess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.\n\n\"Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,\" she said at the time. \"We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.\"\n\nBut with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.\n\nBuckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.\n\n\"Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,\" said Dr Jones.\n\n\"But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.\n\n\"The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.\"\n\nBut those ties are \"weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society\", the historian said.\n\nDr Jones added: \"I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.\"\n\nRoyal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.\n\n\"It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?\" she said.\n\n\"What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it. It's only going to be forgotten about, dilapidated, unless Prince William lets his kids play there.\"\n\nIf that were not the case, she too would like to see it return to Wales.\n\n\"It was a gift so it belongs to them,\" she said. \"I'm not sure really if you can ask for a gift back.\n\n\"But, historically, I'd love to see it, the public have never seen the inside.\n\n\"I would suggest bring it back to St Fagans museum and we can all have a look at it, even if you need to demolish it brick by brick and put it back together.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw119ynlxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-18","timeOfPublication":"10:02:10.806+00:00","title":"French energy giant Total faces war crimes allegations over Mozambique massacre","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"TotalEnergies, a major French energy company, is under investigation for war crimes allegations related to a 2021 massacre in northern Mozambique, where local security forces allegedly tortured and executed dozens of civilians detained in shipping containers near its gas facility on the Afungi peninsula.

Today is a victory for truth, and accountability,\" Perry told the BBC.\n\nThe BBC has contacted TotalEnergies for comment.\n\nThe British government initially offered financial guarantees for UK companies seeking to take part in what was heralded as an unprecedented opportunity for economic development in Mozambique.\n\nBut after suspending support following the bloodshed in Palma, Britain is now being urged to walk away by environmental campaigners, who say the gravity of the allegations against Total must be a \"red line\" for the financial backers of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.\n\nTotal continued to \"demonstrate that it has learned nothing from the past: it just announced the lifting of the force majeure on its gas project, despite the dramatic security and humanitarian situation\", Lorette Philippot from Friends of the Earth France said.\n\nThe UK and Dutch governments must \"refuse to renew their financial support and withdraw from Mozambique LNG\", she added, like French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole.\n\nSupporters of TotalEnergies' determination to proceed with the vast project in Cabo Delgado say it is a bold investment that could bring huge rewards to a neglected region of Africa.\n\nBut critics say it is an environmental, ethical and financial disaster. They draw links between Total's actions and struggles and those of another giant French company, Lafarge, which went on trial in France this month, along with eight former employees, over allegations that it  paid jihadist groups in Syria to keep a cement plant there in operation ."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/harvard-larry-summers-epstein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"21:25:43-05:00","title":"Larry Summers to Step Back From Public Commitments Over Emails With Epstein","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Larry Summers, former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury Secretary, has stepped back from public commitments following the release of private emails showing a prolonged and intimate relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Reality in Epstein Reversal, Beating a Rare Retreat\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T17:44:03-05:00\n\nPresident Trump denounced calls for the release of the Epstein files as a Democratic hoax. He dispatched aides to warn Republicans that backing it would be seen as a “hostile act.” He placed personal calls to those who dared to do so, and even dispatched his attorney general and F.B.I. director to meet with one in the White House Situation Room in efforts to get her to flip.\n\nIn the end, none of it worked. And on Sunday night, Mr. Trump did something he has rarely been forced to do: He caved in the face of pressure from his party and called on House Republicans to go ahead and back a bill that would order his Justice Department to release all of its investigative files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBy Monday, he was saying, “Sure,” he would sign the legislation he has spent months trying to kill.\n\nIt’s not clear that doing so would have any concrete impact; Mr. Trump could have ordered the release of the files without an act of Congress, and has not. And it remains to be seen whether his Justice Department will ultimately release the files.\n\nBut his reversal has opened the floodgates of Republican backing for the bill, which is expected to come to a vote in the House as early as Tuesday and appears likely to pass unanimously. It has also raised questions about Mr. Trump’s ability to impose his will on Republicans and the nation, suggesting a slip in his iron grip on his party amid his falling polling numbers, rising prices and rifts within his political coalition.\n\nFor the first 10 months of his presidency, Mr. Trump has steered the narrative and bullied Congress into doing whatever he wanted with almost no pushback. But as Republicans gear up for midterm elections and some begin to plot a future after Mr. Trump, the Epstein episode is a rare instance in which he has lost control.\n\nFor months, House Republicans had dreaded the prospect of a vote on releasing the Epstein files. Such a moment would leave them torn between pressure from a fervent base demanding that they support the release of the files and a vengeful president who was demanding the opposite.\n\nMr. Trump’s about-face was a bow to the inevitable that came after it had become clear that many, if not most, Republicans were planning to support the measure, wary of appearing to aid in a coverup for a sex offender.\n\n“As long as Democrats and President Trump both are calling for the release, I can’t imagine anyone not voting to release,” Representative Lance Gooden, Republican of Texas, said in a text message. “I predict 100 percent will vote to release.”\n\nEven Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, was now on board, just days after he wrote on social media that he would be a hard “no” on the release of the “Epstein hoax,” designed by Democrats to “distract us from the winning of President Trump and his administration.” He said in a text message on Monday that he would vote to release the files.\n\nMr. Trump’s turnabout came after private conversations with Republicans, who warned him that they would have to vote to release the files because of pressure from their constituents. In those conversations, according to a person briefed on them who insisted on anonymity to discuss them, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the vote was now an inevitability, and that if they needed to support it they should do so. And he listened to Republicans who told him that his opposition was making it seem like he had something to hide.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump did not want to lose.\n\nSo on Sunday night, the president drafted a post for Truth Social while flying aboard Air Force One from Florida to Washington, reversing course.\n\n“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files,” he wrote, “because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.”\n\nMr. Trump was forced to make the pivot because he failed to sway three Republican women who had signed onto a petition that would force a vote on the bill, which would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on Mr. Epstein within 30 days. After the petition received 218 signatures, a House majority, the rules required an eventual vote, and Speaker Mike Johnson said he would call one this week.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who is a co-sponsor of the measure, said that the vote would be an extraordinary example of a unique coalition standing up to Mr. Trump, with the backing of his MAGA base.\n\n“In 48 hours, we went from the president threatening to un-endorse Republicans and hauling them into the Situation Room to his surrendering to math,” said Mr. Khanna, who also predicted a unanimous vote.\n\nThat is in part because the measure has the backing of Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, who is often the lone dissident who breaks with his party to oppose legislation that Mr. Trump urges the conference to support. In this case, Mr. Massie is running the show: He and Mr. Khanna are co-sponsors of the Epstein transparency bill.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has tested not only norms, but also rules and laws, taking a metaphorical wrecking ball to institutions that have often bent to his will. The Epstein files have become the unusual case in which a bipartisan pair of lawmakers, with support from a tiny group of hard-right Republicans, found a way to use House rules to make it impossible for him to get his desired outcome. So on Sunday night, he changed his desired outcome.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump sounded eager to move past the episode and worried about the impact it could have on him and his party.\n\n“Let anybody look at it, but don’t talk about it too much, because honestly I don’t want to take it away from us,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, calling the Epstein files “a Democrat problem.” “The whole thing is a hoax, and I don’t want to take it away from really the greatness of what the Republican Party has accomplished over the last period of time.”\n\nAsked whether he would sign the measure, he told reporters, “Sure I would.”\n\nThat raised renewed questions about whether Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and majority leader, would bring the bill to a vote in that chamber. Mr. Thune had previously hinted that moving ahead with a vote was not a priority.\n\nBut a unanimous House vote — or even a lopsided one — in favor of releasing the files would place enormous pressure on him to allow the bill to be considered in the Senate.\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen, Democrat of Nevada, wrote to Mr. Thune last week urging him to quickly schedule a vote.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/us/politics/trump-epstein-files-congress.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"20:48:49-05:00","title":"Trump Has the Power to Release the Epstein Files, With or Without Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has reversed his previous opposition to a congressional bill that would require the Justice Department to release more materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

political pressure, President Trump has reversed his position on whether he supports a congressional measure that would compel the Justice Department to release more materials from the investigation into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said he would sign the bill if it reached his desk.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s sudden reversal raises a question: If the president agrees that more investigative materials in the Epstein case should be released, why is he waiting for the passage of the so-called discharge petition to do so? Why doesn’t he immediately order Attorney General Pam Bondi to make the documents public?\n\nThe fact is that if Mr. Trump chooses to, he can indeed order more files released — with or without legislation — much as he did in other cases of intense public interest, including the killings of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President John F. Kennedy.\n\nDemocrats have accused the president of trying to cover up embarrassing material by hiding files related to Mr. Epstein, his former friend who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking minors.\n\nBut the White House contends that it has already made public tens of thousands of pages of documents tied to the Epstein investigation and that nothing will satisfy Mr. Trump’s critics.\n\nIn February, Ms. Bondi released a few hundred pages of documents in the Epstein case, including an evidence list, flight logs, a contact book and a heavily redacted masseuse list.\n\nIn September, House Republicans released more than 30,000 pages of documents provided to them by the Trump administration in response to a subpoena; and then another 20,000 last week from the Epstein estate.\n\n“We’ve already given 50,000 pages,” Mr. Trump complained on Monday, adding, “No matter what we give, it’s never enough.”\n\nBut a federal judge has said there are more than 100,000 pages of files and materials related to the Justice Department’s investigation into Mr. Epstein, and the Justice Department has confirmed that it possesses more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence, including files that must be withheld.\n\nOn Monday, a White House official said the administration was releasing documents in conjunction with the House Oversight Committee’s continuing investigation.\n\nFor years, the allegations of sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein — and his close connections to the rich and powerful — have fueled a desire for the release of more documents about his case to expose any other potential abusers.\n\nBut Trump officials, including Ms. Bondi, repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered what they would make public, angering the president’s supporters.\n\nWhen Ms. Bondi released binders full of documents titled “The Epstein Files, Phase 1” just a month into Mr. Trump’s new term, they were widely panned as a disappointment.\n\nAnd there was never a “Phase 2.”\n\nInstead, the Justice Department released an unsigned memo in July informing Mr. Trump’s base that its review of the files “revealed no incriminating ‘client list.’”\n\n“There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” the memo stated. “We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n\nBy this time, Ms. Bondi had already informed Mr. Trump that his name appeared in the files.\n\nThen Congress became involved.\n\nUsing a maneuver known as a discharge petition, Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, have been able to circumvent Republican House leadership.\n\nTheir legislation calls on the Justice Department to make public certain records related to the investigations into Mr. Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring to sexually traffic minors.\n\nSpecifically, the Justice Department must publicly disclose “all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials,” including “records relating to Epstein’s detention and death; flight logs of aircraft owned or used by Epstein; individuals named in connection with Epstein’s criminal activities, civil settlements, or immunity or plea agreements; immunity deals, sealed settlements, or plea bargains of Epstein or his associates; entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal Justice Department communications concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.”\n\nThe legislation also calls for the Justice Department, within 15 days of turning over the documents, to provide Congress with a list of all categories of records released and withheld, all redactions made and their legal basis, and “all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials.”\n\nThe legislation contains a list of exceptions that are very similar to the reasons Ms. Bondi initially cited in her decision to withhold many of the documents.\n\nIn withholding the files, the Justice Department said many contained images of victims, downloaded videos of illegal child sex abuse or materials that had been ordered sealed by a court. The seal served to protect victims but also to ensure the case did “not expose any additional third parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.”\n\nIn the legislation, the Trump administration may withhold records that are classified, identify victims or include images of child sexual abuse, or that would jeopardize an active federal investigation. The Justice Department “may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity,” it adds.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump demanded that the Justice Department investigate a list of powerful men mentioned in some of the emails turned over by the Epstein estate — singling out only Democrats. Ms. Bondi said she had started the investigation.\n\nAfter the president’s order to open an investigation into Mr. Epstein’s Democratic associates, it was unclear on Monday whether the administration intended to argue that the new investigation permitted it to deny requests for documents from previous Epstein investigations.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/business/fed-bowman-bank-oversight.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"17:26:37-05:00","title":"Wall Street’s Top Cop Ushers In Lighter-Touch Oversight of Banks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve, under the leadership of newly appointed vice chair Michelle W.

The way the central bank had long monitored and addressed risks across the financial system was in for a drastic overhaul.\n\nThe memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, contained a list of directives for Fed examiners and supervisory staff across the country that significantly curtailed how closely they scrutinized lenders. It followed a host of changes made by Michelle W. Bowman, a Fed governor, who since becoming vice chair for supervision at the start of the summer had been providing regulatory relief to banks. One day after the memo was sent, Ms. Bowman announced a 30 percent cut in staff across her division in Washington.\n\nCurrent and former policymakers and legal experts were already worried that those changes would encourage exactly the kind of risk-taking that could sow the seeds for the next crisis. But the sweeping nature of the plans outlined in the memo is likely to further fan fears that supervisors will be less equipped to spot such a crisis in advance, risking deeper damage to the economy.\n\n“As a guiding principle, staff should not assume that our current or past operating practices should continue going forward,” the memo said. Staff “should take note of the significant shift in direction and implement the changes necessary to align our supervisory work and messaging with this new approach.”\n\nThe memo was sent by Mary Aiken, acting director of the Fed’s division of supervision and regulation, and Julie Williams, acting deputy director, who stepped into those roles recently after the departure of several Fed veterans. But it was clear they were acting on orders from above.\n\nMs. Bowman, who was appointed to the role by President Trump, has long argued that banks across the country face far too much red-tape and should be allowed to operate which much lighter-touch oversight — views that align with other Trump-appointed financial regulators, the administration and industry lobbyists. In her first speech as vice chair in June, Ms. Bowman said the “task of policymakers and regulators is not to eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and effectively managed.”\n\nWith these changes, Ms. Bowman says she is trying to make the Fed more efficient and effective in safeguarding the financial system — something the Fed struggled with as recently as 2023. Back then, the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank rattled regional lenders across the country and led to a string of bank closures.\n\n“There is no sign that a financial crisis is imminent, but these changes in the aggregate might set the stage for another one,” said Kathryn Judge, a financial regulation expert at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe three-page memo was expansive in its reach.\n\nNo longer would examiners and supervisory staff focus on anything other than a “material financial risk” to a lender’s “safety and soundness” or the financial system. They should not become “distracted” from that priority by “devoting excessive attention to processes, procedures and documentation” of activities that did not reach that threshold. Nor should they devote as many resources to “smaller, less complex and less systemic organizations.”\n\nIn a shift from the past, examiners were given stricter rules about issuing warnings known as “matters requiring attention” or “matters requiring immediate attention,” which have helped to flag risks across the financial system. The memo made clear that the standard for those warnings was changing, and it ordered reserve banks to only independently verify whether an issue was resolved if the company’s internal audit was deemed insufficient.\n\nExaminers should also ensure that warnings were not written in “vague or overbroad language.”\n\nThe memo also outlined changes that sought to limit the oversight power of two groups created by the Fed’s board after the 2008 financial crisis. Those programs — the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee and the Large and Foreign Banking Organization — have aimed to assess risks across the biggest institutions to allow for more comprehensive coverage. But now, those group were directed to avoid conducting such assessments, known as a “horizontal reviews,” unless authorized by the Fed’s deputy director of supervision.\n\nA shift in tack is not unusual when a new vice chair for supervision takes over. Changeovers for that position, which was created after the financial crisis, tend to track election cycles more closely than any other role at the politically independent Fed.\n\nMs. Bowman’s predecessor, Michael S. Barr, a Biden administration appointee who pushed for stringent bank regulations, announced his departure in January to avoid a legal fight with Mr. Trump. Randal K. Quarles, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, resigned at the end of the first year of the Biden administration, having loosened the regulatory reins on Wall Street.\n\nIn addition to setting policy, the Fed’s division in Washington oversees the reserve banks, which carry out the board’s orders and interact with lenders.\n\nUnder Ms. Bowman’s leadership, the Fed has already announced a number of regulatory changes. These include loosening a rule dictating how much easy-to-access money lenders need to set aside against their leverage and making annual tests gauging banks’ ability to withstand shocks less onerous. Both were approved by a majority of the seven-person board of governors, including the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\nMs. Bowman has spearheaded those efforts amid a raft of departures from the top ranks of her division, which she wants to shrink from around 500 employees to roughly 350 by the end of next year.\n\n“This is dismantling supervision and regulation in a much more public way than we’ve seen in the past,” said Ellen Meade, who served as a senior adviser at the Fed until 2021. “Cutting bodies at some point can result in cutting functions and competency.”\n\nThe Fed is not the only financial regulator undergoing upheaval to align with the Trump administration’s vision. The president wants more sway over how the central bank and other independent institutions, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, oversee Wall Street. In January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing more authority over rule changes.\n\nAnother regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees lenders that are not banks, including payday lenders and debt collectors, has already been gutted. Non-bank companies are especially prevalent in the mortgage market, where they originate more than half of all new loans.\n\nAfter becoming acting director in February, Russell T. Vought, the director of the White House budget office, immediately ordered C.F.P.B. employees to halt their work.\n\nBefore Mr. Vought arrived, the bureau’s supervision department was its largest division, with nearly 500 analysts and examiners. The group scrutinized financial companies’ handling of products like checking accounts, car loans, mortgages and credit cards, and exposed improper fees, charges for services never provided, errant auto repossessions and wrongful foreclosures. The agency forced banks and other lenders to return nearly $20 billion to customers.\n\nMr. Vought stopped all exams. He also ordered all outstanding regulatory issues to be resolved by the end of the year. The bureau’s examiners have been instructed to accept financial companies’ claims and close issues without further verification, according to two employees involved in the work.\n\nMr. Vought wants to close the agency, which cannot be done without congressional approval. The agency recently told a federal court that it would run out of operating cash early next year.\n\nThe F.D.I.C. and the O.C.C. are scaling back their examination processes and have cut their supervisory teams through buyouts and attrition. The agencies are gathering public comments on a proposal to stop flagging potential problems that do not pose the threat of “material harm” to an institution.\n\nBecause the biggest banks handle trillions of dollars, even issues affecting large numbers of customers or big markets might not rise to that level. After a sham accounts scandal came to light at Wells Fargo, the O.C.C. acknowledged that its examiners had overlooked years of warning signs.\n\nThe Fed and the F.D.I.C. declined to comment. The C.F.P.B. did not respond to a request for comment. An O.C.C. spokesman said the agency’s proposed changes would reinforce a “risk-based” approach to supervision.\n\nDaniel K. Tarullo, a former Fed governor, said that bank supervision could be made more efficient, but that he was apprehensive about the recent changes.\n\n“The whole point of supervision is to fill in the many blanks that are left by quantitative metrics,” he said. “If your regulations on capital are less restrictive, then you should be more focused on making sure that any shift in bank activities is not creating problems.”\n\nPeggy L. Twohig, who led the consumer bureau’s supervision department until 2021, added that supervision is effective because examiners can flag risks to financial institutions confidentially, allowing lenders to address problems before they get too big. “People don’t know what problems were stopped before they had a chance to hurt them,” she said.\n\nAnother former regulator worried about the rules being applied unevenly, leading to inconsistent standards for a healthy bank. Fewer supervisors could mean less capacity to track risks that may appear small but could become more significant.\n\n“When you create blind spots like this, you limit what your range of visibility is,” said Peter Conti-Brown, an expert on Fed governance at the University of Pennsylvania. “Why does the drunk look for his keys under the light post? Because that’s where the light is. But we want to be able to find our keys where they are.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/health/measles-us-elimination-status-outbreaks.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-17","timeOfPublication":"19:25:15-05:00","title":"C.D.C.

Links Measles Outbreaks in Multiple States for the First Time\n\nPublished: 2025-11-17T19:25:15-05:00\n\nHealth officials on Monday linked for the first time the measles outbreak that began in Texas with another in Utah and Arizona, a finding that could end America’s status as a nation that has eliminated measles.\n\nThe news came in a phone call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, among officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments.\n\nThe chain of transmission began in January, in a conservative Mennonite group on the western edge of Texas, and spread to Oklahoma and New Mexico.\n\nCountries lose their elimination status after 12 months of sustained transmission. If the outbreak cannot be extinguished by January, the anniversary of the first cases in Texas, the United States will lose what is known as “elimination status” as determined by the World Health Organization, which it has had for 25 years.\n\n“I wouldn’t call the code yet, but I think the patient’s not looking real good,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nCanada lost its status last week, ending a 27-year run, after failing to control an outbreak that began at a Mennonite gathering in October 2024.\n\nLosing elimination status may not lead to tangible changes, such as travel restrictions. But experts have called the possibility “deeply embarrassing” for a wealthy country with the medical resources of the United States.\n\nA representative from the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThis month, the C.D.C. presented its outbreak information to the Pan American Health Organization. As of Nov. 13, the C.D.C. had confirmed 1,723 measles cases nationwide, 87 percent of which were associated with a record 45 outbreaks so far this year. By contrast, 16 outbreaks were reported in 2024.\n\nAbout 92 percent of the reported cases this year are among people who are either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status.\n\nThe subtype of measles that is circulating, identified by the number 9171, first took hold on Jan. 20 in Gaines County, Texas, and “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” said Dr. David Sugerman, who leads the C.D.C.’s measles response, on the call.\n\nThe country’s measles elimination status is “very much still under threat if we see that same sequence transmitting in current outbreaks ongoing through the end of January,” he said, when the outbreak will have been going on for a year.\n\nThe C.D.C. is working with health authorities in Canada and Mexico to share best practices and collaborate on decoding the genetic sequences of the measles virus, he added.\n\nThe outbreak in Utah and Arizona is currently the largest in the country, with more than 180 cases. Most new infections are among household members of infected individuals, but roughly one in four across both states have an unknown origin, suggesting that officials are missing some sources of exposure. About 7 percent of infections were contracted at congregate events, including weddings and other festivals.\n\nLocal public health officials in Utah said efforts to encourage vaccinations in the area have had “limited” impact. While there was an initial spike in vaccination rates when the outbreak first took root, progress has fallen off.\n\n“It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months,” said Dr. David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review.\n\nAnother large outbreak in two schools in South Carolina is close to being contained. Rockland County, N.Y., has four reported cases, the first since a massive outbreak in 2018 that lasted 10 months. That outbreak raced through Orthodox Jewish communities, some of which had vaccination rates below 70 percent.\n\n“Overall, the risk of widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low,” Dr. Sugerman said. But the virus may quickly move through close-knit communities where vaccination rates are low, he warned.\n\nThe infections in New York this year stem from two people traveling from Israel. In total, the United States has had 152 importations from at least 47 countries, including eight new ones just in the last two weeks.\n\n"}]}
