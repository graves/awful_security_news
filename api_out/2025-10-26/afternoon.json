That might sound a bit extreme, but bad things can happen in there,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to die in the cage. I definitely don’t want to. But it’s a dangerous sport. The idea is to hurt the other person.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s them or me, one of us has to get beat up, and it’s going to have to be them, it’s as simple as that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The “other person” on Saturday was  Ciryl Gane , himself a former interim heavyweight champion. And though the fight was much anticipated, representing Aspinall’s first defense of the undisputed title he claimed when former holder  Jon Jones  retired in June, it ended prematurely and controversially.\n \n\n   \n  Gane accidentally poked Aspinall in the eye at the end of the first round and, when the Brit was unable to continue, the referee declared the fight a no-contest.\n \n\n   \n  That meant Aspinall retained his title, albeit in bizarre circumstances, and he was taken to hospital after the fight.\n \n\n   \n  Despite not defeating a reigning champion to gain his title, Aspinall has established himself as the dominant figure in the heavyweight division. The Englishman is 8-1 in the UFC, with his only loss coming when he sustained an unfortunate non-contact injury 15 seconds into his 2022 fight against Curtis Blaydes.\n \n\n   \n  Having claimed all but one of his wins in the first round, Aspinall also holds the record for the shortest average fight time in UFC history.\n \n\n   \n  Aspinall does not believe he is the dominant name in the sport just yet, but is clearly proud of his ascent to the top of his division.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if I’m the face. I think that’s a bit unfair on a couple of other people to say that I’m the face,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “But I keep telling myself that this is where I wanted to be, the first time I put the gloves on. And all these years later, this is where we are.”\n \n\n   \n  Aspinall’s status within the sport would make him a strong candidate to feature in President Donald Trump’s proposed  UFC fight on the White House lawn , and the 32-year-old would not turn down the opportunity were it to come his way.\n \n\n   \n  “If it was offered to me, yeah. Absolutely I would. I’d fight anywhere in the world,” he said. “If I’m still the champion by then, whoever the number one contender is, that’s who I’ll fight.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think any time a big name like (Trump), or somebody else of his stature, is involved with the sport and they’re attached to it, there’s more eyes on the sport,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/us/lincoln-university-shooting-homecoming-pa-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00Z","title":"1 Dead, 6 Injured in Shooting During Homecoming at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A shooting at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania during its Homecoming weekend on October 25, 2025, left one person dead and six injured, with gunfire occurring near the International Cultural Center during a celebratory crowd gathering after a football game.

Lincoln University Saturday night, during the historically Black university’s Homecoming weekend, according to officials.\n \n\n   \n  A total of seven people were hit with gunfire after shots rang out near the school’s International Cultural Center, where Homecoming crowds were celebrating after that afternoon’s football game, authorities said at news conference early Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “That festivity was interrupted and decimated by gunfire. It was a chaotic scene, and people fled in every direction,” Chester County District Attorney Christopher de Barrena-Sarobe said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials did not give details on the conditions of the six injured.

John Fetterman.\n \n\n   \n  “My position has been from Day 1 — open up the government. That’s where Sen. Fetterman, my counterpart, Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, has been,” McCormick told CNN’s Manu Raju in a wide-ranging interview for “Inside Politics Sunday,” adding that he would take the same tack if he were a member of the minority party.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman has now voted 12 times with Republicans on a short-term bill to extend current government funding levels through November 21.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s had the courage to stand up for what he believes in. We have found common ground, and when we find it, we work together,” McCormick said of Fetterman, whom he calls “an extraordinary partner.”\n \n\n   \n  He dodged repeatedly when asked whether he thinks Fetterman, who hasn’t yet said he’ll run for a second term in three years, should be reelected.\n \n\n   \n  “I trust him. Can’t always say that about people in Washington these days. I trust John Fetterman to do what he thinks is right and what he thinks is right for Pennsylvania,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  McCormick emphasized that Fetterman, who insists he’ll remain a Democrat despite mounting disagreements with his caucus, is “not a conservative by any stretch” and said he hasn’t urged him to change parties.\n \n\n   \n  “What we agree on is that where we can find common ground, we’re going to work together for Pennsylvania. And that’s, unfortunately, more rare these days than it should be,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  He made clear he’s less interested in finding common ground right now with most of Fetterman’s fellow Democrats, who are demanding assurances that Republicans will work with them to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t negotiate with a terrorist,” he said, calling the minority party’s asks “extremely unreasonable.”\n \n\n   \n  “You can have any negotiation, discussion you want about extending health care benefits, but you can’t start with you’re going to shut down the government to get them,” he continued, aligning himself with the stance of Senate GOP leaders and Trump administration officials who have said they won’t talk to Democrats until the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on his choice of the word “terrorist” to describe some of his Senate colleagues, McCormick responded that he thinks Democrats are “irresponsibly imposing pain on the American people” and “holding (essential government services) hostage to try to get a political win.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s just unacceptable,” he asserted, later adding, “we can have a discussion about health care, benefits and anything else, but we can’t do it with a gun at our head.”\n \n\n   \n  After the interview, McCormick told Raju that he meant to refer to Democrats as “hostage takers” — not terrorists.\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans show no signs of caving as the shutdown is almost certain to stretch into a fifth week, McCormick is among the GOP lawmakers who Democrats hope will be pressured to the negotiating table as their constituents begin to enroll in another year of health insurance with drastically higher premiums.\n \n\n   \n  He called former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law a “failure” and argued that the purpose of the enhanced tax credits was to help “overcome” the ACA’s shortcomings.\n \n\n   \n  Still, McCormick worries about the “implications” for many working Pennsylvanians, who could face 82% higher premiums, according to state estimates.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people in Pennsylvania live paycheck to paycheck, and if their premiums go up dramatically, that’s going to be a big deal,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he’d be in favor of extending ACA subsidies for another year, McCormick answered, “I certainly support having that conversation, particularly as it affects working families.”\n \n\n   \n  The fight in Congress comes ahead of next year’s midterm battle, when Democrats hope to mobilize voters around the issue of health care affordability.\n \n\n   \n  McCormick, who unseated a Democratic incumbent and won one of the closest Senate races in the country last year, said he’s not concerned that Republicans’ position in this shutdown standoff might come back to hurt them in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course” his party is worried about health care costs, McCormick said, claiming that while Republicans are “focused” on addressing the issue, the political “headline” that voters will look to is the “remarkable delivery” of Trump’s 2024 campaign promises.\n \n\n   \n  McCormick also says he isn’t worried about some of the more controversial headlines generated by the president.\n \n\n   \n  He defends Trump where a few of his fellow Republicans express reservations and lauds him for sticking to campaign commitments that won his political ally the state of Pennsylvania — and the White House — by a larger margin than McCormick won to scoop up his seat.\n \n\n   \n  He noted Trump was a private citizen when he requested $230 million from the Justice Department as compensation for investigations into him, though those asks are still on the table and could ultimately result in the president receiving millions in taxpayer dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on the fact that Trump could just drop the request, McCormick responded, “the president said that whatever happens, he won’t benefit from it personally, so I’d say let it go through the court system.”\n \n\n   \n  It is however possible that the Justice Department, which Trump ultimately oversees as president, could agree to a monetary settlement before the issue makes it to a court.\n \n\n   \n  Though most of McCormick’s Republican colleagues have dodged on the subject, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who isn’t running for reelection, bemoaned last week that news of a potential payment to Trump at the expense of taxpayers looks “horrible” amid a weekslong government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  And McCormick also isn’t concerned about the optics of Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing to build a massive ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  “The project was underway, and it’s not being paid by taxpayer dollars,” he said, calling the multimillion dollar project funded by wealthy donors and major companies “small ball and tiny” compared with the president’s efforts to make peace in war-torn Gaza and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  As the president continues to ramp up his wielding of executive power, often with very little input from Congress, McCormick rejects the premise that Trump is acting “outside the boundaries” of his office.\n \n\n   \n  The former Army captain said while he would like to be “more updated” on the series of recent US military strikes on alleged South American drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he believes Trump is being “consistent” in what he told voters he would do to take on the cartels.\n \n\n   \n  “If it was a president I didn’t trust, I’d want to know a lot more. But what he’s doing is consistent with the promises he made,” McCormick said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jenna Monnin contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/sport/mlb-world-series-game-2-dodgers-blue-jays","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"11:45:00-11:45","title":"Yamamoto’s masterful outing leads Dodgers to Game 2 win over Blue Jays to even up World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Game 2 of the 2025 World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1 at the Rogers Centre, tying the series at 1-1.

over the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1 on Saturday night at the Rogers Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Starter  Yoshinobu Yamamoto  yet again pitched a complete game, retiring the final 20 batters he faced as the Dodgers tied up the series at 1-1.\n \n\n   \n  The 27-year-old struck out nine batters, giving up one earned run on four hits allowed.\n \n\n   \n  It was Yamamoto’s second consecutive complete game in the postseason, becoming the first Dodgers pitcher to do so since Orel Hershiser in 1988, according to the Fox broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Just like on Friday, the Dodgers got the scoring started early after catcher Will Smith hit an RBI single to score Freddie Freeman and take a 1-0 lead.\n \n\n   \n  But Jays starter Kevin Gausman was able regain control after a rocky first inning, with Toronto eventually tying the game at 1-1 following an Alejandro Kirk sacrifice fly in the third inning.\n \n\n   \n  Gausman had retired 17 straight Dodger batters until the seventh inning, when Smith yet again got the best of him, hitting a solo home run to break the stale mate.

The former Arizona Diamondback threw three straight in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very happy and proud of the fact that I was able to bring a big contribution and give a chance for the team to win,” Yamamoto told reporters via a translator after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Despite all the success, Yamamoto downplayed any history he has made including previously becoming the first Japanese Japanese-born player to throw a complete game in the MLB postseason.\n \n\n   \n  “To be honest, I’m not sure about the history, but I’m very happy about what I did today,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Smith, who caught the last two starts for Yamamoto, called those outings “fun.”\n \n\n   \n  “He can kind of do everything,” Smith told the Fox broadcast. “Locate his fastballs so well, he’s got the curveball, the split.

nuclear-powered missile as Ukraine hit with more deadly strikes \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, CNN, Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:21 AM EDT, Sun October 26, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile and will work towards deploying the weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, after Moscow launched its second deadly attack on Ukraine in two nights.\n \n\n   \n  Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, said the weapon remained airborne for about 15 hours and covered a distance of around 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles). During the test, the Burevestnik missile demonstrated “its high capabilities in evading anti-missile and anti-aircraft defences,” Gerasimov said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Putin said, “We need to determine the possible ways of using it and start preparing the infrastructure for deploying this weapon,” adding that it’s a product “no one else in the world has.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Russia also held a “planned” strategic nuclear forces drill under Putin’s supervision. The Kremlin said the drill tested staff skills and the readiness of military command-and-control systems, adding that all objectives were met.\n \n\n   \n  It comes as Russia launched more than 100 drones on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, striking high-rise buildings in Kyiv as residents slept.\n \n\n   \n  A 19-year-old girl and her mother, 46, were among three people killed in air strikes on the Ukrainian capital, according to Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. A further 29 people were wounded, including seven children.\n \n\n   \n  “The youngest is four years old,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.\n \n\n   \n  The latest wave of violence came as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky Zelensky issued a fresh appeal for more Patriot missile defense systems, part of a broader efforts to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russia’s sustained aerial assault.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday night, a fire erupted at a nine-story residential building in the capital’s Desnianskyi region, where 13 people were rescued from the upper floors. Additionally, a Russian drone struck a 16-story high-rise, shattering windows from the first to the ninth floor, emergency crew said.\n \n\n   \n  Natalia Zura, 49, escaped from the burning house with her daughter Maria using a fire ladder.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a terrible night. We had to climb down the fire escape from the third floor. Thank you to our rescuers, our guardian angels. We are very grateful because we almost suffocated, we almost burned to death,” Zura told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Olha Motianina, 34, had left Kyiv for a nearby village with her family because of the constant bombardment. On Sunday, she returned to her home in the city to find the windows shattered from the blast.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a very sad picture. People have died, and I don’t know how to describe it. It’s very sad and affects my mental state,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Another drone struck a high-rise building in the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv, but firefighters said the site was not set ablaze.\n \n\n   \n  “Every Russian strike is an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible on ordinary life,” Zelensky said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “This week, they’ve been striking residential buildings, our people, our children… these are the main targets for the Russians,” he added, noting that the Kremlin has unleashed nearly 1,200 drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs and over 50 missiles on his nation in the past week.\n \n\n   \n  More than a hundred rescuers and police officers in Kyiv responded overnight into Sunday, checking the stability of the burned out high-rises as well as clearing debris and dismantling damaged structures, Klymenko, the interior minister, said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere in the city, crews continue painstakingly clearing debris from the previous night’s attack.\n \n\n   \n  The magnitude of the attack and the extent of its damage was not immediately known. Klitschko did not confirm whether the buildings were directly hit or struck by falling debris from destroyed weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Russian air defense systems destroyed one drone heading for Moscow, the city’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin visit a command post of Russian forces and met with the military’s General Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, the Kremlin said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “The President was given a detailed report on the situation on the line of contact,” said the Kremlin statement.\n \n\n   \n    Renewed push for Patriot missiles\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies to defend against Russian barrages of missiles and drones – often several hundred in one night. Repeated deadly attacks have underlined the shortfall in Ukraine’s air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  An overnight attack Saturday killed at least four people in Ukraine, prompting Zelensky to ask for more Patriot missile systems “so that we can protect our cities from this horror.”\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump  has been pushing  for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia but those attempts have made little progress so far.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump had a phone call with Putin last week, he was so convinced there was enough progress made that he announced he was heading  soon to Budapest  for an in-person summit.\n \n\n   \n  Five days later, the  summit was off  and  new sanctions on Moscow  were on.\n \n\n   \n  “It just it didn’t feel right to me,” Trump said Wednesday. “It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it.”\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Trump struck a similarly pessimistic tone, saying he has no immediate plans to schedule a meeting with Putin and insisting that any summit will have to wait until a potential peace deal seems achievable.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while  traveling to Asia . “I’m not going to be wasting my time. I’ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The president again said he had expected resolving the conflict to be easier, noting, “I could say almost any one of the deals that I’ve already done, I thought would have been more difficult than Russia, than Ukraine, but it didn’t work out that way.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo and Kosta Gak contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/trump-asia-trip-leaders-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Asia trip to test his dealmaking abilities with old rivals and new friends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump begins his first Asia trip of his second term with a series of high-stakes diplomatic engagements aimed at strengthening US influence amid rising competition from China.

10:38 PM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President Donald Trump will lean on the power of in-person diplomacy on the first Asia trip of his second term as he meets with old rivals, new friends and, potentially, adversaries, while looking to cut deals that could have sweeping economic and national security implications.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s love of tariffs — just like his unpredictable approach to relationships abroad — has generated uncertainty among once-solid US allies in the region, setting up a major test of whether the “Art of the Deal” author can deliver.\n \n\n   \n  Trump arrived in Malaysia late Saturday (Sunday morning local time) for a six-day, three-country tour after having reimagined the role of the US in the world — a role he’s trying to defend against the rising influence of China, in particular, around the globe.\n \n\n   \n  The “America First” president touts what he says are Trump-brokered ends to eight wars, including a  fragile ceasefire  for the Israel-Hamas conflict, and uses his tariff policy as leverage. And he’s said that the conflict whose resolution has been most elusive — Russia’s war in Ukraine — will be on the agenda during the highest-stakes meeting of the trip, with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, with which the US is embroiled in a simmering trade war.\n \n\n   \n  In Kuala Lumpur, Trump will sign a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, the president said Saturday. The Southeast Asian neighbors  agreed to a ceasefire  in July to end escalating violence on their disputed border, after Trump warned their respective leaders he would not make trade deals with them if the deadly conflict continued.\n \n\n   \n  “I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,” Trump wrote in a  Truth Social post .\n \n\n   \n  Trump will later join key leaders at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who will seek to deepen partnerships with the US. He will meet with Japan’s new, conservative prime minister in Tokyo. Trade and security are on the agenda as he meets with the South Korean president.\n \n\n   \n  But all eyes are on the expected meeting with Xi in South Korea, which has already been colored by questions of whether it will even happen. The prospect of a potential  meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un  — with whom he shared an infamous 2019 handshake in the Korean Peninsula’s demilitarized zone — also looms over the trip.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s engagements with his counterparts will be closely watched for any progress toward repairing economic ties, expanding trade and making good on investment promises — and whether he can tap into the influence of regional leaders to help expand security cooperation.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these leaders and countries (are) going to have been subject to US reciprocal tariffs, pressure to spend more on defense — a bit of bullying by the United States,” said Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS.\n \n\n   \n  “But in spite of this, the reception, I think, will be positive. Everybody still wants to cut a deal with the US president,” Cha noted, pointing to those nations’ desires for tariff relief.\n \n\n   \n  And, as with any presidential trip abroad, the stagecraft will be meticulously managed as each of Trump’s hosts tries to flatter the American president with pomp and circumstance.\n \n\n   \n    A critical Xi meeting\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Xi met face-to-face five times during the American president’s first term, including a Mar-a-Lago welcome for Xi and a Trump trip to Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  But the circumstances of their most recent in-person meeting, in June 2019 on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Japan, underscore the complicated relationship that persists six years later, after the Covid-19 pandemic and the administration of President Joe Biden.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the US and China were seeking a trade deal amid major tariff escalations by both countries. Though Trump and Xi described that June meeting positively, both countries  continued  to lash out with further tariff threats and had on-and-off negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has long heralded Xi’s leadership and touted a warm relationship with his counterpart, whom he’s described both as a “friend” and  “extremely hard to make a deal with.” \n \n\n   \n  And Beijing is seeking some predictability from Trump, who notoriously conducts a capricious brand of diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  This time, the lead-up to their expected meeting has had plenty of twists and turns, with trade tensions  reigniting  recently after Beijing announced plans to restrict exports of rare earth minerals. Trump then threatened to impose tariffs starting at 130% on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the current 30% minimum rate. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate against all these actions. China has also paused purchases of American soybeans, causing a strain on US farmers.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump threatened to call off the meeting, writing on Truth Social: “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  But an optimistic Trump on Wednesday indicated he’s heading into talks in dealmaking mode.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll make a deal. I think we’re going to make a deal on — the rare earth is the least of it. … I think we’re going to make a deal on soybeans and the farmers. I think we’re going to make a deal on maybe even nuclear,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Top US and Chinese officials’  trade talks in Malaysia  this weekend will set the stage for the president’s talks with Xi. But speaking to Fox Business before the trip, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declined to rule out further escalatory measures if a pause or relief on Beijing’s rare earths regime can’t be negotiated.\n \n\n   \n  Ambassador Nicholas Burns, who served in the top US diplomatic post in Beijing during the Biden administration, predicted that Trump and Xi could reach a nontraditional deal during their talks. He cast such a negotiation as “a series of commitments without binding language,” pointing to potential areas of agreement on TikTok, fentanyl and soybean exports.\n \n\n   \n  “My best sense is that we’re not going to see a finished trade deal next week. Too little time,” Burns said in a  conversation  previewing the trip with the Atlantic Council. “The best we can expect,” he said, is the two leaders agreeing on “certain principles” that their aides can follow up on.\n \n\n   \n  And Dr. Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economics program, tempered expectations for some of the more intractable disagreements between Washington and Beijing, suggesting that Trump and Xi will reach agreements on “deescalations, rather than solving the underlying systemic issues.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is also hoping to lean on his meeting with Xi to massage another key relationship recently on the rocks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he can have a big influence on Putin. … Look, he’s a respected man. He’s a very strong leader of a very big country,” Trump said in previewing talks about how to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  China has deep economic ties to Russia, and the countries’ leaders have shown solidarity in recent months, which raises a key test for Trump and the American influence he’s trying to project around the world.\n \n\n   \n    A new Japanese prime minister\n \n\n   \n  Trump will also have the opportunity to meet with staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi, who became Japan’s first female prime minister earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Like the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump developed a close relationship during his first term, she  supports  revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and has visited a controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II — both issues that spark anger in neighboring China and South Korea. She also opposes same-sex marriage and a growing movement to allow Japanese married couples to use separate surnames.\n \n\n   \n  Trump praised her as a “highly respected person of great wisdom and strength” in a  Truth Social post  after her election. But the leaders’ interactions — and whether they can cultivate the same warm ties Trump enjoyed with Abe — will be closely watched.\n \n\n   \n  But for Trump, it’s not just friendship that matters — it’s also economic deals. He’s likely to highlight Japan’s commitment to invest $550 billion in the US, with Takaichi’s government working to finalize an initial package of purchases, according to Dr. Kristi Govella, Japan chair at CSIS.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who made multiple trips to Japan during his first term, is also expected to be greeted by the country’s emperor, visit with US troops, meet Japanese business leaders and, according to Govella, visit with Abe’s widow, who spent time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last year.\n \n\n   \n    Sleepless in South Korea\n \n\n   \n  Trump will also meet a new leader in South Korea, where trade and security are high priorities for talks with President Lee Jae Myung, who assumed office in June after a tumultuous political moment for his country as his predecessor declared martial law.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, South Korea and the US have  unveiled  a new trade deal, which called for 15% tariffs on goods from the country and a massive $350 billion investment in the US. The trade agreement has not gone into effect, and Trump’s tariffs have placed significant strain on the South Korean economy.\n \n\n   \n  The US-South Korean relationship also faced a major test in September when nearly 500 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested and detained during an  immigration raid  at a Hyundai plant in the US state of Georgia, sparking outrage back home. Lee openly expressed concern about the future of South Korean investment in the US, saying that confusion over the visa situation for South Koreans would lead local companies to question “whether they should go at all.”\n \n\n   \n  But Lee has sounded optimistic ahead of his meeting with the US president.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that is taking some time. And I also believe in the rationality of the United States. And so I believe that we will be able to reach a rational agreement,” he told CNN’s Will Ripley.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that in the end, we will be able to reach a rational result that is acceptable. Because we are an alliance — and we both have common sense and rationality,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Regional tensions are also at the forefront this week, with Lee eying Trump’s “peacemaker” abilities. The president’s trip, which coincides with the APEC economic summit, comes just days after South Korea’s northern neighbor offered its latest provocation, test-firing ballistic missiles — North Korea’s first military show of force since Lee took office.\n \n\n   \n  “I also believe that President Trump wants to achieve world peace. That’s why I have asked him to take on the role of peacemaker,” Lee told CNN, saying he’d welcome the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting.\n \n\n   \n    Prospects of a Kim Jong Un meeting\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately discussed  setting up a meeting  between the US president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during this trip, though many are skeptical it will ultimately happen, sources familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting during the trip, even if there hasn’t been any of the communications between Washington and Pyongyang that Trump at times had during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  “They have a lot of nuclear weapons, but not a lot of telephone service. So I’m open to it. I had a great relationship with him, and he probably knows I’m coming, right? But if you want to put out the word, I’m open to it,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether he’d see Kim.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2019, Trump became the first sitting US president to step into North Korea, a brief but historic moment that came together quickly after the president tweeted an invitation. The leaders met for nearly an hour at the demilitarized zone — but the meeting did not yield substantial progress, and North Korea has subsequently  bolstered  its nuclear weapons program.\n \n\n   \n    Regional leaders\n \n\n   \n  Trump is expected to meet with other key counterparts in Kuala Lumpur, including Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and leaders from the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries where the US is seeking to build influence.\n \n\n   \n  But leaders in each nation have grappled with instability during the US president’s second term — as well as impacts from the administration’s cuts to foreign aid.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/weather/hurricane-melissa-storm-tracker-forecast-jamaica-haiti-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"06:03:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa forecast to become a rare Category 5 tonight, seek shelter now in Jamaica","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa is rapidly intensifying into a rare Category 5 storm, with its center 120 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica.

forecast to become a rare Category 5 tonight, seek shelter now in Jamaica \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:03 AM EDT, Sun October 26, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Melissa is undergoing extreme rapid intensification and is a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph winds Sunday morning. The US National Hurricane Center expects it to strengthen into a rare Category 5 hurricane tonight.\n \n\n   \n  The center of the hurricane is located 120 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica and the storm is moving westward at just 5 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Those in Jamaica need to “seek shelter now,” according to the NHC. “Damaging winds and heavy rainfall today and on Monday will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides before the strongest winds arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning.”\n \n\n   \n  Torrential rains are impacting portions of Haiti and tropical storm conditions are likely occurring in Jamaica. Heavy rainfall will last for several days, bringing life-threatening, potentially catastrophic impact.\n \n\n   \n  “I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica looks to be the epicenter for the worst of Melissa’s triple threat of extreme rainfall flooding, wind damage and storm surge. Melissa could make landfall on Jamaica late Monday or early Tuesday.   Haiti also continues to be in thick of Melissa’s destructive flood and landslide threats.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane warning is effect for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions are expected by Monday. Southern Haiti and portions of Cuba are under a hurricane watch.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa has been moving at a snail’s pace for days and it won’t pick up speed anytime soon as it tracks generally westward through Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  That slow movement has already caused problems. Torrential rain bands have swamped Haiti and the Dominican Republic for much of the week, causing flooding and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a  statement . In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced, officials said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is expected to continue to rapidly intensify Sunday, ramping up its destructive wind and storm surge threats alongside the intense rain as it tracks near or south of Jamaica through early next week. Landfall as a Category 4 hurricane is expected, but a Category 5 landfall cannot be ruled out and Melissa could be the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  This explosive strengthening is  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n    Melissa’s extreme threats\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica, Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic will face the worst of the storm into at least early next week. Next in line for strong winds, storm surge and flooding rain will be eastern Cuba, the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.\n \n\n   \n  Rainfall totals up to 40 inches are expected from Melissa in parts of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica through Tuesday, with local maxima of 40 inches. Eastern Cuba could receive totals of up to 18 inches.\n \n\n   \n  “Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period of time,” in Haiti on Saturday, the hurricane center warned. “This is a life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect life and property should be taken.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of ferocious winds. The most extreme winds will likely occur as Melissa tracks near Jamaica on Monday into Tuesday.   Downed trees, power outages and structural damage could be widespread.\n \n\n   \n  Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, halting outpatient and elective procedures to ensure more beds are open, according to  Christopher Tufton , Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports are closing. Norman Manley International Airport closed after its last scheduled arriving flight at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Saturday evening, according to Daryl Vaz, the minister of transport. The  Sangster International Airport  plans to close at noon on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Saturday. “It’s going to sit there, pouring water while it’s barely moving and that is a significant challenge… as long as what is predicted does take place.”\n \n\n   \n  Peak storm surge heights could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. Storm surge will also be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n \n\n   \n  “Now is the time to secure your home, check your roof, windows, and surroundings. Use sandbags or plywood where needed and clear any overhanging branches safely,” Holness, the prime minister, wrote on X. “If you live in a flood-prone area, take protective measures and have an evacuation plan ready”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaicans who spoke with Reuters on Saturday acknowledged the danger of a slow-moving hurricane, contrasting Melissa’s sluggish pace to Hurricane Beryl.\n \n\n   \n  “Slow movement still cause a lot of damage, right?” said fisherman Clive Davis in Kingston. “Different from Beryl cause Beryls come with a speed and never stay too long. Just sweep through. But this now, she wants to come stay, visit Jamaica for 3 days, why?”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s gonna slow down business, but it’s nature,” Davis added. “We can’t fight against nature, right?”\n \n\n   \n  Into Saturday, workers in Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city’s western flank. When Melissa brings its months’ worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two.\n \n\n   \n  The United States mainland is not expected to be directly threatened by Melissa. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming\n \n\n   \n   Hurricane Beryl  in July 2024 was the last storm to heavily impact Jamaica. It did not make landfall, but still lashed the island with flooding rain and strong winds as it passed to the south as a Category 4.\n \n\n   \n  As this tricky forecast comes into focus, all signs point to Jamaica being ground zero for what could become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/26/us/chicago-forgiveness-crime-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Two men’s lives were torn apart by police lies.

It took decades to get justice \n       \n  By Omar Jimenez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Sun October 26, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “I didn’t want to talk to him,” Keith Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  Both in their 50s now, they grew up on the same block in Chicago — “across the street, three houses,” Smith said, pointing and counting, on a recent visit.\n \n\n   \n  What drove them apart happened in December 1989, where they were both accused of the murder of two men in their neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Police picked up Gibson for the crime, even though he told them he was running an errand on the other side of the neighborhood at the time of the killing.\n \n\n   \n  At the precinct, the officers handcuffed him to a chair. He was kept for days, where he was punched, slapped and kicked. He blacked out at least once while in custody, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Police were interrogating Smith at the same time. He was also getting severely beaten — until finally he made a decision to get himself out of there.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m gonna lie, so they could probably let me go,” Smith said he decided. Police told both men that the other had ratted them out, so he took the opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  To end his captivity, Smith signed a statement that he didn’t write. In it, he claimed he acted as a lookout while Gibson committed the murders.\n \n\n   \n  This statement didn’t end up helping him in the long run, when he was charged with the crime.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson, meanwhile, stuck to his denials. And yet, when he was charged with the crime as well, police told the court that he admitted to being at the scene — and that he said Smith was there too.\n \n\n   \n  What Gibson and Smith didn’t know for years is that the group of officers who tortured them into talking had done so to many others. It just took a long time for the truth to be exposed.\n \n\n   \n  “Gibson and me was just a pawn in their pursuit of trying to solve cases,” Smith said.\n \n\n   \n  A police commander named Jon Burge presided over the group of detectives who abused Smith and Gibson. He was fired a few years later over allegations of brutalizing a suspect in custody.  As of 2025, at least 130 people are known to have been tortured by Burge and his detectives. \n \n\n   \n    The arrest\n \n\n   \n  After they were interrogated, Gibson was sent home, where his family tried to hug him but saw him wincing in pain. His sister immediately called the police to file a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The next day the police came.\n \n\n   \n  “There were like 10 or 15 officers and they were right in the front yard,” Gibson said. That was when they arrested him and charged him with murder.\n \n\n   \n  “My family being in the house, I didn’t want to cause no disturbance, I just got up and they said, ‘Man, you under arrest’ and they took me up out of there,” Gibson said. That would be the last time he’d see his home for almost 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  That October — this was 1990 — Gibson went before a judge in a bench trial. “That’s where I fucked up at,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He now wishes he’d insisted on a jury trial. But at the time, he said, “I was never worried about anything. I was never scared about anything, ‘cause I ain’t do nothing,” he said. “How do you fight a case that don’t exist?”\n \n\n   \n  The extorted statements, plus testimony from Smith’s sisters (who would later say they were lying) and another man supposedly in the area at the time of the shooting, who was in jail on a pending armed-robbery charge, was more than enough for the judge.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Smith was also convicted of murder, and also sentenced to life.\n \n\n   \n  That’s how Gibson and Smith both ended up in prison, each furious under the impression that the other had put them there.\n \n\n   \n    A legal education\n \n\n   \n  Inside, motivated by an episode of  Perry Mason , Gibson turned himself into a jailhouse lawyer, investigating every bit of recourse he could find. His mother was his inspiration. “She told me I was coming home and I believed that,” Gibson said. “And I’m still mad too, but she told me I’ve gotta get some things out my heart,” he said, meaning the rage he had been feeling. “I’m still working on that,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  She wouldn’t live to see it happen. Gibson’s mom died in April, 2002, 12 years into his sentence. But he did listen.\n \n\n   \n  Smith’s parents also died while he was serving his sentence.  And Smith said he started getting letters from Gibson, he estimated he’d get a few a year.\n \n\n   \n     “I would never respond, due to me being mad,” Smith said. “You would feel like that too, if you feel like somebody done did you like that.”\n \n\n   \n  What changed? He talked to an “old school cat” in his prison who “understood the law.” This inmate told him: “Man, they fucked both of y’all,” he said. And: “’Y’all both can go home from this shit.” So finally, after 16 years, Smith answered Gibson’s letters.\n \n\n   \n  In 2006, Smith filed what they call a “successive postconviction petition,” based on new evidence from a special state’s attorney  report  that laid out in intense, horrifying detail how Burge’s torture operation worked.\n \n\n   \n  That report backed up Smith’s claims that his confession was the product of coercion by the “Midnight Crew,” as they were called.\n \n\n   \n  He wasn’t released until 2012, when he made an  Alford  plea, in which he got to maintain his innocence while also admitting his guilt, which can reduce a prison sentence. For Smith at the time, it didn’t matter how.  After 22 years, he was free.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson, meanwhile, had applied to a newly created Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission tasked with investigating claims of torture by Burge or his detectives. If five or more members of that commission thought a claim was credible, they would send it straight to the Circuit Court for judicial review.\n \n\n   \n  In 2015 Gibson got that chance. The commission agreed there was evidence he had been tortured and referred his claim back to the same court that had sent him to prison. Years passed, until finally he got a new trial.\n \n\n   \n  Then in April,    2019 all charges against him were dismissed and Gibson walked free.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t have no feelings,” Gibson said. “I’ve been fighting so long, I’m still swinging. I’ve been punch drunk.”\n \n\n   \n  The next year he got a certificate of innocence.\n \n\n   \n  Still, he hasn’t fully recovered. “I sweat in the middle of the night every night at three o’clock,” he said, with the thoughts of the prison conditions keeping him awake. “I had to plug my ears up and nose up with toilet paper ‘cause roaches was so deep in there. You can hear ‘em, smell ‘em,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Very different outcomes\n \n\n   \n  Gibson and Smith grew up on the same block, both were tortured into prison, both lost their parents while serving their sentences, and now both were finally free.\n \n\n   \n  Only recently did their stories diverge.\n \n\n   \n  After Gibson got his certificate of innocence, he filed a civil lawsuit against the City of Chicago. This year, the city decided to settle his case on a rainy June Wednesday for $14.75 million.\n \n\n   \n  “Every time I get a blessing, it rains. It be my mama,” Gibson said. After the city council officially ratified his settlement, he took a moment for himself outside the council chambers.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m here, mama, I made it. I’m here, mama, they couldn’t break me,” he said out loud through his tears. One of the first people to comfort Gibson was Smith.  They see each other around; Gibson had come to a party to celebrate Smith’s birthday a few weeks before; today, they were here for a party for Gibson.\n \n\n   \n  While Gibson was now millions of dollars richer, Smith was “basically homeless,” he said. “It’s hard for me, everything.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith didn’t qualify for a certificate of innocence, which would have allowed him to file a civil suit, because he took that  Alford  plea to get out of prison when he did.\n \n\n   \n  “Once you do that, you have no remedy,” said Gibson’s attorney, Andrew M. Stroth, managing director at the Action Injury Law Group. Because Smith took that plea to get out of prison sooner, “He cannot pursue a civil case,” Stroth added.\n \n\n   \n  Smith was happy to get out when he did — getting out of jail the better part of a decade before Gibson did.  “My mama just died, my father just died. You think I’m thinking about some money?” Smith said. “Fuck some money, man. That’s what I did.”\n \n\n   \n  “You could give him a hundred million dollars,” Smith said, but still Gibson wouldn’t be able to get the seven years back that he got.\n \n\n   \n  If the shoe was on the other foot, Gibson said, he would have done the same thing.\n \n\n   \n  “If my mother would’ve still been alive, I’d have took an  Alford  Plea too, just to spend one moment with my mother,” Gibson said. “But my mother had died the first 12 years of my false imprisonment. They ain’t had no bargaining chip when they started trying to bring me deals.”\n \n\n   \n  “James Gibson could’ve walked out of prison much earlier but because he was innocent and he knew he was innocent, he was going to fight all the way,” Stroth said.\n \n\n   \n  As Smith looked around, taking stock of where exactly he was and what it took to get there, he reflected on the final words he heard before his freedom was taken away decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  “‘Take him into the custody of the Department of Corrections where he will serve out the remainder of his life,’” he roughly remembered the judge saying.\n \n\n   \n  “Look where I’m at. Look where Gibson’s at,” Smith said. “That’s some hell of a shit that make me want to cry.”\n \n\n   \n  Smith is the first to admit life is hard these days for him. “No transportation, no work consistently — what I would like is that, and to be able to have a place to go home,” he said, while we were walking his block.\n \n\n   \n  But, “I got what I really want and that’s freedom,” he said, to “just get up and come outside.”\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said even though he now has the money, knowing he can never get back the time weighs on him.\n \n\n   \n  “It ain’t no congratulations,” Gibson said. “I had my whole life ahead of me.” He was standing outside of his old family home.\n \n\n   \n  “We take so much for granted out here in the world man.” He looked out into the storm. “That’s the rain. Clearing up and washing up all this other mess,” Gibson said. “She sending me a signal, saying, ‘Now are you satisfied?’”\n \n\n   \n  Smith is working on the same point of view. “I’m trying to catch up,” he said. “I can’t get back those 20 something years. I’ve gotta enjoy what’s left of this and that’s how I look at the road ahead.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/business/trump-tariffs-canada-reagan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:39:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he’s increasing tariffs on Canada by 10% after Ontario’s Reagan ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canada in response to a misleading advertisement that falsely portrays former President Ronald Reagan’s anti-tariff views.

Reagan ad \n       \n  By Auzinea Bacon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:39 PM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said Saturday he is increasing the tariff on Canada by 10% over current levels, further escalating trade tensions over what he called a “ fake ” ad that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n \n\n   \n  “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted on  Truth Social , adding, “Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.”\n \n\n   \n  The president’s post came after he said Thursday he was terminating trade talks with Canada, threatening once again to upend the crucial economic relationship between the United States and its second-biggest trading partner. The new tariff is Trump’s latest salvo in his global trade agenda   after he imposed a levy   of 100% “over and above” any tariffs on China in retaliation for new export controls Beijing imposed on rare-earth minerals earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Trump posted about the tariff while aboard Air Force One as he heads to Asia for a five-day trip beginning in Malaysia, where he will meet with Southeast Asian leaders. He is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the end of his trip in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  The Canadian   ad, purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, featured  clips from a speech  in which Reagan railed against tariffs. The ad quoted Reagan, who said tariffs hurt “every American worker and consumer” and were “triggering fierce trade wars.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said the ad misrepresented the former president’s words.\n \n\n   \n  Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Friday that he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and that the US ad campaign would pause on Monday “so that trade talks can resume.”\n \n\n   \n  But the ad would continue to run over the weekend during the World Series, which is between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays, Canada’s only Major League Baseball team.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” Trump said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Ford’s spokesperson referred CNN to the premier’s Friday statement in which he said the ad would be paused Monday. CNN has reached out to Carney’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister responsible for trade with the US, said late Saturday that the country hoped for “constructive discussions” with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration — which is the responsibility of the federal government,” he said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  Carney and Trump are both in Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, which began late Saturday (Sunday morning local time).\n \n\n   \n  “Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole. We hope this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation. CUSMA means a North America where businesses do better. A successful free trade zone is fundamental for both our economies,” Candace Laing, the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Canada has long been one of America’s top trading partners, behind China and Mexico, making trade tensions a heated topic. Last year, the United States imported  $411.9 billion worth of goods  from Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s steep sectoral tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber and energy — some of the country’s key exports to the United States — have hit Canada especially hard. Canada’s unemployment rate is now at its  highest point  in nine years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also hurting the US economy because of  Canadian boycotts . According to data from Statistics Canada, Canadian travel to the US by land is down 31% this year through the end of September. Exports of American spirits to Canada  plunged by 85%  in the second quarter, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.\n \n\n   \n  But goods that are compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which Trump negotiated in his first term, have largely been able to enter the US duty-free. Trump’s repeated tariff threats have many expecting major changes to the USMCA when it is  reviewed next year .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/26/politics/white-house-east-wing-history","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"The White House’s East Wing is now demolished.

Here’s what was lost \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EDT, Sun October 26, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Amid the rubble and rancor memorializing where the East Wing of the White House once stood, President Donald Trump and his team are trying to dig out. Public outrage has been piling up over the  sudden demolition  to make way for the sprawling,  golden ballroom  he has long craved. Trump says the new construction will be a monument to the country’s greatness, even as his team insists there is nothing unusual in how he is going about it.\n \n\n   \n  “Nearly every single president who has lived in this beautiful White House … has made modernizations and renovations of their own,” insists White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n \n\n   \n  Author Kate Andersen Brower, who has written extensively about The People’s House, agrees with that foundational claim, but also points out a big difference this time: “We have never seen a wrecking ball taken to an entire wing.”\n \n\n   \n  Never mind that Trump has dismissed the East Wing as “a very small building” that was “never thought of as being much.” Brower and plenty of others saw it as a treasure. “I certainly had a lot of reverence for it because it was the first lady’s domain. It’s the only place she has to really call her own,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Initially a carriage entrance during the term of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, it became the modern East Wing as millions of tourists see it each year — or did — under his distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt some 40 years later. The build-out was a practical matter: With World War II raging, an emergency underground bunker had been constructed on the spot and needed the building to hide it.\n \n\n   \n  “So in a sense,” Brower says, “it’s always been a bit of an afterthought, and some people within the White House call it Siberia because … you always want to be as close to the West Wing and the Oval Office as possible, and the East Wing is obviously removed.”\n \n\n   \n  Accordingly, the East Wing has always been considered a seat of soft power — more about social events than the political punch-ups in the West Wing.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing is where throngs of well-wishers swirled beneath streetlamps in 1911 to wish President William Howard Taft and his wife, Helen, a happy 25th anniversary. It is where President Dwight Eisenhower sat in the private movie theater to watch “High Noon,” where President John F. Kennedy saw “From Russia With Love” just before he was assassinated; where President Richard Nixon — perhaps ironically — saw “The Sting” ;  and where President Bill Clinton gathered staff and political pals to watch the Super Bowl.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing is where a photographer in 2009 caught President Barack Obama running playfully down a hall with his dog, Bo. The Portuguese water dog was a gift from Sen. Ted Kennedy, who had endorsed Obama over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Kennedy would die later that year.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the East Wing windows, Jackie Kennedy once doted over a green expanse of grass bordered with blooming plants and crowned by a pergola drawn up by Chinese American architect I.M. Pei — who would later design the stunning glass pyramid atop the entrance to the Louvre Museum in Paris. Separate from the Rose Garden, which has now been paved over by Trump, and christened the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden by her successor, Lady Bird Johnson, the space hosted weddings, receptions and other events.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing is also where first lady Melania Trump erected those red Christmas trees in her husband’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  Brower notes of the East Wing, “If you were going to a Christmas party, that’s where you would enter. It was a beautiful space — gorgeous portraits lining the walls of first ladies over the years.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing was not totally separated from more dire business. The bunker below — officially called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center — is where Vice President Dick Cheney went during the 9/11 attacks, and where Trump was taken during protests in his first term. President George W. Bush used the East Wing to practice his State of the Union address in 2004.\n \n\n   \n  And in a blend of social and serious matters, civilian visitors passing through the East Wing in 2010 could pause to write cards to service members in overseas conflicts.\n \n\n   \n  To be sure, those closest to Trump  do not seem broken up  by the destruction of the East Wing. The president had already left a distinct mark on the space by hanging a glaring picture of his face overlaid with an American flag pattern between the portraits of Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  The White House says it has taken steps to preserve historic artifacts from the East Wing, and the official chatter is now about the future: about that expansive, expensive, glittering ballroom Trump says will hold close to 1,000 people and will reflect the glory of the country in a way he deems suitable.\n \n\n   \n  He insists  private donors  will pay for it all. But that won’t keep some longtime admirers of the East Wing from mourning a legacy they say no money could ever buy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/us/dna-test-fertility-fraud","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+08:00","title":"China Firmly Opposes External Interference in Hong Kong's Affairs and Reaffirms Commitment to 'One Country, Two Systems'","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Chinese government has reiterated its firm opposition to any actions that threaten Hong Kong's stability, emphasizing that Hong Kong's security and rule of law are within China's internal affairs.

He told her the complication – coupled with McKesson’s willowy build and Amazonian height – could be a sign of an inherited disorder called  Marfan syndrome .\n \n\n   \n  His suspicions were correct. A geneticist confirmed McKesson’s diagnosis, and said her clotting disorder was also genetic, which ushered in a host of lifelong health challenges.\n \n\n   \n  Her heart would now need to be constantly monitored, and she will eventually need at least one more major heart surgery.\n \n\n   \n  But the diagnosis was puzzling for another reason: both of her conditions are genetic and, as far as she knew, no one else in her family had them.\n \n\n   \n  McKesson, 43, said she didn’t have a full picture of her family’s health history because her father died when she was a teenager. So, she signed up for 23andMe, submitted a DNA sample, and waited.\n \n\n   \n  The results arrived in her inbox in October 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “I was just sitting on my couch after work, and kind of quickly pulled up the results on my phone,” McKesson recalled. At first, she said, she was curious to learn more about her family’s ethnic background.\n \n\n   \n  “Growing up, I always was like … ‘I don’t look like any of y’all. No one has my nose. I’m a foot taller than everyone,’” she said, adding her family used to joke that she was adopted.\n \n\n   \n  While there weren’t many surprises in her family’s ancestry, McKesson said when she navigated to the “family members” section of the site, she drew up short:\n \n\n   \n  The test showed she had seven half-siblings.\n \n\n   \n  “I just remember being shocked and my mind just swirling,” she said. “I’m like, how is this possible? … Did my dad have another family or something?”\n \n\n   \n  Was she actually adopted? None of what she was learning made sense.\n \n\n   \n  She sent screenshots of the results to a trusted group of friends, and they discussed different theories. Then, later that night, she sent a message to her newly discovered half-siblings through the 23andMe website.\n \n\n   \n  “Humor has really gotten me through a lot of this,” McKesson said, so she opted for a lighter tone in her first note.\n \n\n   \n  She sent the same message to each name listed on the site. And then, she waited. It would take more than a month for anyone to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to cause any conflict,” one of them finally wrote, “but if you want to dig into this, I’d ask your parents if they went to see Dr. Peete.”\n \n\n   \n    A doctor’s decades of deception\n \n\n   \n  The couple wanted children, Laurie told CNN, but Doug had a vasectomy during a previous marriage, so her OB-GYN referred them to the physicians at Duke for fertility treatment.\n \n\n   \n  The 1980s and ‘90s would prove to be a time of innovation in the fields of genetics and assisted reproductive technology. In 1978, a woman gave birth to a  baby named  Louise in the United Kingdom through in vitro fertilization, or IVF, making her the first child to be born through the novel procedure.\n \n\n   \n  But the Kruppas opted to use intrauterine insemination, or IUI, a procedure that had been around in some form for centuries but had only recently become common thanks to  advances  in freezing and banking sperm.\n \n\n   \n  During the procedure, a doctor places donor sperm directly into the patient’s uterus during ovulation, to increase the chances of conception.\n \n\n   \n  The Kruppas were instructed to bring $50 to each visit and, Laurie stressed, they were told the donor sperm would come from a resident in the university’s medical school.\n \n\n   \n  At each visit, Kruppa said she laid back on the table, placed her feet in the stirrups, and waited. And then, Peete would walk into the room.\n \n\n   \n  “He seemed nice enough and concerned, but we didn’t have a lot of interaction,” Kruppa recalled decades later.\n \n\n   \n  I would “wait 10 or 15 minutes, and then he’d come back and insert the sperm.”\n \n\n   \n  Kruppa said it took the couple seven attempts to conceive their eldest daughter. Two visits, less than a year later, to conceive their second daughter. And a single visit in 1984 to conceive their son.\n \n\n   \n  And for each child, Peete used his own sperm without her knowledge or consent.\n \n\n   \n    Revelations and revulsion\n \n\n   \n  During those years, Kruppa said she and her husband had moved their family from North Carolina to Ohio and debated whether they should even tell their kids they were donor-conceived.\n \n\n   \n  “We thought maybe the two girls were definitely related because they came 16 months apart. So, we just thought maybe it was a resident that was still there,” Kruppa said.\n \n\n   \n  “My son was born two and a half years later, so we thought it had to be somebody different.”\n \n\n   \n  After years of keeping their secret, Kruppa said the rising popularity of consumer DNA products eventually forced their hand. They revealed the news to their children during a family vacation.\n \n\n   \n  “They all reacted very well,” Kruppa said of her kids. “They’ve never not thought that (Doug) was their dad.”\n \n\n   \n  But they also joined 23andMe and began doing their own research. Kruppa said her middle child was the first to discover their connection to Peete. Out of the blue, her daughter asked what hospital her parents used and if Kruppa remembered the name of her doctor.\n \n\n   \n  Then, the kids called another family meeting and revealed what Peete had done to their parents. Initially, Kruppa said, “I was really glad they were all true siblings.”\n \n\n   \n  It took her months to fully process what Peete’s actions meant for her – and over time, she became angry.\n \n\n   \n  “When I started thinking, I got much more upset about the ethics of it,” she said. “I’m pretty sure he was my father’s age … This is like getting raped by your father.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than a year after his father died from cancer, Harris said his mom called and insisted they meet to discuss something important.\n \n\n   \n  “She drops this bomb that, my dad never wanted to tell me this, but they couldn’t conceive at the time, and they went to a fertility clinic at Duke University.\n \n\n   \n  “It was early 1977,” he said, “and they got a sperm donor.”\n \n\n   \n  Coming so soon on the heels of his father’s death, Harris said the confession caused him to spiral. He was raised as an only child, but 23andMe revealed he had multiple half-siblings.\n \n\n   \n  And Harris said his conversations with one sibling in particular stood out.\n \n\n   \n  At first, the woman was confused about their shared genetics, then curious. Maybe she was also donor-conceived, and their parents had used the same donor, she suggested.\n \n\n   \n  But when Harris started researching the woman’s maiden name, he discovered her father was Dr. Peete. He sent her a message.\n \n\n   \n  To Harris, the conclusion was clear: His mom’s doctor had used his own sperm instead of a donor’s.\n \n\n   \n  It took Peete’s daughter days to respond to the revelation, and when she did, she admitted to being “stunned, shocked and completely baffled.”\n \n\n   \n  “It didn’t even cross my mind that my dad would’ve been the donor, because my dad was the most honorable human being,” she wrote, “… being a part of whatever or however this happened just doesn’t add up.”\n \n\n   \n  But as they continued to exchange messages, she later noted how Jim looked a lot like her father.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there is more to this story we may never really know,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    The country doctor\n \n\n   \n  A public obituary posted online describes Peete as a “compassionate country doctor,” who discovered his passion for medicine by observing his father, the town physician.\n \n\n   \n  Peete graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1947 and, according to the obituary, he completed a residency in obstetrics, gynecology and endocrinology before accepting a position as an assistant professor and physician at Duke in 1956.\n \n\n   \n  Decades later, in the late 1970s, Peete would become one of Dr. Ken Fortier’s attending physicians and his mentor during his gynecology and gynecological surgery residency at Duke.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very calm and composed,” Fortier recalled. “He was superb technically as a surgeon. He made things look easy that others might struggle with.”\n \n\n   \n  Peete, he said, was the type of person who was “quietly there in the background, but they’re always there when you need (them).”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Fortier told CNN, it was widely known that residents and medical students – especially those specializing in obstetrics and gynecology – were often tapped to donate sperm.\n \n\n   \n  “There wasn’t anything taboo about it,” he said. “There were people in the department who specialized in infertility that tended to have a kind of cadre of donors, and they usually were the best people that were generally healthy.”\n \n\n   \n  But when he learned, through CNN, that his mentor and colleague had fathered the children of some of his patients, Fortier searched for the right words.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea … the thought of using one’s own sperm … that surprised me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    When fertility treatment becomes fraud\n \n\n   \n  In 1909, a physician in Minnesota wrote a letter to the editor of a medical publication describing an “artificial impregnation” he said he’d witnessed 25 years earlier – in 1884 – while attending medical school in Philadelphia.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time the procedure was so novel, so peculiar in its human ethics, that the six young men of the senior class who (witnessed) the operation were pledged to absolute secrecy,” author A.D. Hard wrote.   \n \n\n   \n  A wealthy couple had visited the hospital to learn why they were struggling to conceive. Hard said the husband was deemed sterile and one of the medical students joked that the only way his wife could get pregnant was with “a hired man.”\n \n\n   \n  “The woman was chloroformed and with a hard rubber syringe some fresh semen from the best-looking member of the class was deposited in the uterus, and the cervix slightly plugged with gauze,” Hard wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The professor, he said, later confessed his actions to the woman’s husband.\n \n\n   \n  “Strange as it may seem, the man was delighted with the idea,” Hard wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Both the doctor and the professor agreed to never tell the man’s wife, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Today, these actions – and those of Dr. Peete – would be deemed not only unethical, but an act of medical malpractice.\n \n\n   \n  Informed consent – or the idea patients have the right to make independent and informed decisions about their own bodies and healthcare outcomes – is a cornerstone of modern medicine.\n \n\n   \n  In using his own sperm without his patients’ knowledge, experts told CNN, Peete violated that central covenant.\n \n\n   \n  “If he said, ‘we’re using a resident’s sperm,’ and it was his own sperm, that’s very problematic,” said Dr. Robert Klitzman, director of Columbia University’s Masters of Bioethics program and author of the book “Designing Babies.”\n \n\n   \n  “The standard (of care) should be to tell people where the sperm is coming from,” he said, “Even back then.”\n \n\n   \n  But Peete is far from the only doctor to have committed this type of deception. In 1992,  Cecil Jacobson  was convicted of 52 counts of fraud and perjury for inseminating his patients with his own sperm and was sent to prison. And the advent of consumer DNA products has led to numerous claims of fertility fraud over the years.\n \n\n   \n  For all its focus on creating life, the US fertility industry remains underregulated, Klitzman said. While many countries have pushed to limit or outright prohibit anonymous sperm donations, Klitzman noted the US does not have similar laws.\n \n\n   \n  “There are many things that we look at now with an ethical understanding of the full harms, risks, benefits … and think – what were they thinking back then?” Klitzman said.\n \n\n   \n    Peete ‘forever changed my life’\n \n\n   \n  For McKesson, the rationale for Peete’s actions is secondary to their repercussions. Learning the truth of her paternity has sparked something of an existential crisis, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the hardest thing to process once you started putting the pieces together was that I was a product of a crime, that I was the product of medical rape,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Both McKesson’s clotting disorder and Marfan syndrome are genetic, meaning one of her biological parents either passed on the traits, or it’s what scientists describe as a “new mutation.”\n \n\n   \n  Our DNA consists of billions of letters that combine to form a unique word: You. But sometimes, as the genetic code from each parent divides and replicates, changes are made. Scientists call these mutations.\n \n\n   \n  “Most mutations have no meaning,” Klitzman said, “but occasionally one does and that’s the so-called ‘de novo,’ – a new mutation.”\n \n\n   \n  These mutations can be spontaneous, but the paternal age of a sperm donor can also be a factor. A study  published earlier this month  in Nature revealed genetic risks for children increase as fathers age.\n \n\n   \n  Peete would have been approaching 60 at the time McKesson was conceived.\n \n\n   \n  When she learned Peete was her biological father, McKesson said she reached out to his family for more information on his health but did not hear back.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve never blamed his family for anything, I mean, they didn’t ask for any of this either,” McKesson said.” But “let’s just say (Marfan syndrome) doesn’t run in his family – it could also come from the fact that he was older.”\n \n\n   \n  Without further insights into her paternal health history, McKesson admitted she doesn’t have a way to be sure.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve just had to accept that this chapter is never going to be closed,” she said. “It’s just forever changed my life.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, McKesson said, because genetic impacts can span generations, she’s been vocal about her conditions with her half-siblings, encouraging anyone she meets to get themselves – and their children – tested.\n \n\n   \n  At McKesson’s insistence, Harris, who is 6’7”, was also tested for Marfan syndrome, but he was negative.\n \n\n   \n  Thus far, McKesson said Peete is believed to have fathered at least 12 children outside of his immediate family over more than 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  But, she added, that number is solely based on those who have submitted DNA samples to consumer DNA sites like 23andMe and Ancestry.\n \n\n   \n  And with 23andMe  filing for bankruptcy  earlier this year, her chances of finding any additional siblings may be dwindling.\n \n\n   \n    A matter of life and death\n \n\n   \n  In emails reviewed by CNN, the university appeared initially to be responsive. A lawyer was hired to contact Peete’s previous clients and investigate his actions, and, at Kruppa’s instigation, the university now also offers an ethics course that addresses fertility fraud.\n \n\n   \n  For a time, McKesson said, the university also appeared to be mediating conversations between Peete’s victims and his immediate family.\n \n\n   \n  But when she continued to insist the Peete family provide more insight into the doctor’s genetic and medical history, they stopped responding.\n \n\n   \n  When reached for comment on this story, Duke Health officials said in a statement its program is built on a “commitment to operating within the highest ethical and legal standards in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have been made aware of unacceptable actions by an individual that occurred in our program in the early days of fertility care during the late 1970s and early 1980s,” the statement said. “The unacceptable actions could not happen today at Duke Health and should never have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reached out to the legal team that investigated Peete’s actions but did not receive a response.\n \n\n   \n  In the US,  14 states  have passed laws against so-called fertility fraud. North Carolina, where Dr. Peete was employed, does not yet have a statute against it.\n \n\n   \n  Both McKesson and Kruppa said they have separately considered lawsuits. But, given the lack of regulation over the US fertility industry, and the fact that Peete has died, they feel their options are limited.\n \n\n   \n  McKesson said it’s “pretty impossible for the victims to have any sort of justice in this situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, she told CNN, she was most disappointed by how both the Peete family and Duke University have responded to the situation – especially considering that, at least in her case, it could be a matter of life and death.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt like this was a chance for them to step up and be involved in doing the right thing, and they’ve chosen not to,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The patients that were impacted and their families deserve to know that they may have had a crime committed against them and be acknowledged – and to know their family medical history to the extent that that’s possible.”\n \n\n   \n  For a while, McKesson said, she would research her newfound siblings to see what traits they have in common. She has the same smile as one of Peete’s daughters, she said. And both McKesson and Harris are slim and tall.\n \n\n   \n  But she said she’s decided to speak out now because she’s concerned other siblings might also unknowingly be living with a life-threatening genetic disorder.\n \n\n   \n  With treatment, a person diagnosed with Marfan syndrome can  expect to live  as long as someone without the disease.\n \n\n   \n  But left untreated, the  average life expectancy  is 45 years.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in sharing my story is that if I have any other half-siblings out there, that I could save their life by knowing my medical history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to do the right thing.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ryan Young and Meridith Edwards contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/business/pork-jerky-recall","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:42:00-04:00","title":"Company recalls 2 million pounds of barbecue pork jerky that may contain metal wire","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"LSI, Inc., a South Dakota-based food manufacturer, has voluntarily recalled over 2.2 million pounds of Korean barbecue pork jerky labeled 'Golden Island fire-grilled pork jerky' sold at Costco and Sam’s Club due to possible contamination with metal wire from a conveyor belt during production.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armed police handcuffed and searched a student at a high school in Baltimore County, Maryland, this week after an AI-driven security system flagged the teen’s empty bag of chips as a possible firearm.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore County officials are now calling for a review of how Kenwood High School uses the AI gun detection system and why the teen ended up in handcuffs despite school safety officials quickly determining there was no weapon.\n \n\n   \n  “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me,” Kenwood student Taki Allen told  CNN affiliate WBAL,  describing what happened Monday evening when police arrived at the school while he was waiting with friends for a ride home after football practice.\n \n\n   \n  “They searched me, and they figured out I had nothing. Then, they went over to where I was standing and found a bag of chips on the floor,” Allen said.\n \n\n   \n  He described a distressing scene with a heavy police response.\n \n\n   \n  “The first thing I was wondering was, was I about to die? Because they had a gun pointed at me,” Allen told WBAL, saying about “eight cop cars” pulled up to the school.\n \n\n   \n  “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun,” Allen told  WBAL .\n \n\n   \n  The AI-powered security system at the school is just one example of how schools are approaching safety in the age of  mass gun violence .  AI tools  have exploded in popularity in recent years, including tools to help monitor surveillance footage.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Baltimore County Police Department for comment. The department told WBAL officers responded to “a report of a suspicious person with a weapon” but determined the person was unarmed after a search.\n \n\n   \n  Kenwood Principal Kate Smith said the school district’s security department reviewed and canceled the gun detection alert after confirming there was no weapon, according to a statement sent to parents that was shared with CNN. Smith said she reported the matter to Kenwood’s school resource officer, who called local police for support.\n \n\n   \n  The principal didn’t immediately realize the alert had been canceled, a spokesperson for Baltimore County Public Schools told WBAL.\n \n\n   \n  “We understand how upsetting this was for the individual that was searched as well as the other students who witnessed the incident,” Smith said in the statement. “Please know that ensuring the safety of our students and school community is one of our highest priorities.”\n \n\n   \n  Omnilert, the company that operates  the AI gun detection system , expressed regret over the incident and emphasized that its system is designed to identify a possible threat and elevate it to human review.\n \n\n   \n  “We regret that this incident occurred and wish to convey our concern to the student and the wider community affected by the events that followed,” the company told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “While the object was later determined not to be a firearm, the process functioned as intended: to prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification,” the company added.\n \n\n   \n  The AI gun detection system has been used in Baltimore County public schools since 2023, analyzing video from the schools’ existing security cameras, Superintendent Myriam Rogers said during a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Rogers called Monday’s incident “truly unfortunate” and said the district never wants to put any of its students in such a frightening situation.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed response to the false alarm has sparked outrage in the community, with Allen’s grandfather Lamont Davis demanding accountability.\n \n\n   \n  “Something has got to be done,” he said to WBAL. “Changes have to be made and people have to be held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore County officials say they want a review of the process that led to Monday’s police response.\n \n\n   \n  “No child in our school system should be accosted by police for eating a bag of Doritos,” Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka said in  a statement  on social media, calling on the school district “to review procedures around its AI-powered weapon detection system.”\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore County Councilman Julian Jones also called for a review of the use of the AI system “to make sure there are safeguards in place, so this type of error does not happen again,” according to WBAL.\n \n\n   \n  Superintendent Rogers said reviewing the system and security practices in Baltimore County schools “is part of our regular practice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/europe/georgia-arrests-chinese-nationals-uranium-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:25:00-04:00","title":"Georgia arrests three Chinese nationals for trying to buy uranium illegally, local media reports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Georgia arrested three Chinese nationals in Tbilisi for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium—classified as nuclear material—for $400,000 with plans to transport it to China via Russia.

She was 100.\n \n\n   \n  Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,” he said. “It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.”\n \n\n   \n  The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.\n \n\n   \n  From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series “Lassie.” From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure “Lost in Space.”\n \n\n   \n  Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.\n \n\n   \n  Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.\n \n\n   \n  “I must quote Dan Rather,” she said in a 1994 interview. “I can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.\n \n\n   \n  “I love rock ‘n’ roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding — the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don’t go with my image.”\n \n\n   \n  Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: “All This and Heaven Too,” “Adam Had Four Sons,” “Sergeant York,” “Miss Annie Rooney,” “Forever and a Day” and “Meet Me in St. Louis.”\n \n\n   \n  She also made “Son of Lassie,” the 1945 sequel to “Lassie, Come Home,” playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.\n \n\n   \n    New life on television\n \n\n   \n  When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in “Lassie” on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show’s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)\n \n\n   \n  Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies “are bigger, the ruff is bigger, they’re more imposing looking.”\n \n\n   \n  She added: “I worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.\n \n\n   \n  “Lassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.”\n \n\n   \n  After six years in the rural setting of “Lassie,” Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in “Lost in Space.”\n \n\n   \n  After their mission is sabotaged by a fellow passenger, the nefarious Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), the party bounces from planet to planet, encountering weird creatures and near-disasters that required viewers to tune in the following week to learn of the escape. Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her “space pie.”\n \n\n   \n  As with “Lassie,” Lockhart enjoyed working on “Lost in Space”: “It was like going to work at Disneyland every day.”\n \n\n   \n  In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of “Petticoat Junction” for the rural comedy’s last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig. The original star, Bea Benaderet, had been diagnosed with cancer and died, also in 1968.\n \n\n   \n    A little bit of everything\n \n\n   \n  Lockhart remained active long after “Lost in Space,” appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera “General Hospital” and nighttime soaps, “Knots Landing” and “The Colbys.” Her film credits included “The Remake” and the animated “Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm,” for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl.\n \n\n   \n  She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays “Steel Magnolias,” “Bedroom Farce” and “Once More with Feeling.”\n \n\n   \n  “Her true passion was journalism,” Gregory said. “She loved going to the White House briefing rooms.”\n \n\n   \n  Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta.\n \n\n   \n  Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him.\n \n\n   \n  Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children’s ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 “A Christmas Carol,” playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents.\n \n\n   \n  She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with “Lassie.”\n \n\n   \n  Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: “How wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/europe/irish-presidency-catherine-connolly-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"15:35:00Z","title":"Veteran left-winger wins Irish presidency in landslide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Catherine Connolly, a veteran left-wing politician and independent candidate, won the Irish presidential election on October 25, 2025, with 63.4% of the vote, defeating incumbent center-right candidate Heather Humphreys who received 29.5%.

in a stinging rebuke to the recently re-elected center-right coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Connolly, 68, a long-time critic of the European Union in overwhelmingly pro-EU Ireland backed by the left-dominated opposition, was not a household name and was underestimated by many at the start of the contest for the largely ceremonial role.\n \n\n   \n  Connolly, an independent candidate, built momentum as the campaign progressed, enthused younger voters and was elected with 63.4% of the vote. The other candidate seeking election, ex-cabinet minister Heather Humphreys, won 29.5%.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be a president who listens, who reflects and who speaks when it’s necessary.

Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:47 PM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roosevelt Avenue in Queens runs through one of New York City’s most densely populated neighborhoods, a cacophonous display of diversity underneath the 7 train.\n \n\n   \n  There are Colombian restaurants and taco stalls next to Indian food and fruit stands. Vendors sell homemade tamales and grilled meat. There are cell phone repair stores that double as money transfer counters and eyebrow threading salons side by side. Walk around some more and you can buy saris or imported shapewear that promise to slim down the figure.\n \n\n   \n  Usually at night and sometimes by day, sex workers can also be seen walking the avenue and throughout the Jackson Heights neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  The problem has vexed New York City’s two most recent mayoral administrations. Now, it’s become an issue in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Zohran Mamdani’s opponents point to his support for decriminalizing sex work as evidence that the Democratic nominee is soft on crime, though Mamdani’s campaign argues he doesn’t support legalizing it either. In focusing on the issue, Andrew Cuomo’s aides argue he can flip South Asians and Muslim voters, making a symbolic argument as much as an electoral one against Mamdani, who is vying to become the city’s first Muslim mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has been ramping up his attacks on Mamdani’s faith, specifically raising the issue before religious communities and arguing that Mamdani’s ideas are “haram,” an Arabic term meaning “forbidden.” His aides think that he can peel off more conservative voters willing to put aside any cultural pride in Mamdani, the Ugandan-born son of parents of Indian origin.\n \n\n   \n  Farhad Soleiman, general secretary of the Jackson Heights Bangladeshi Association, believes Cuomo’s message is getting across.\n \n\n   \n  “I spoke to Cuomo, and our community needs to understand these are the issues and I am saying they are mad because this is against Islam and frankly against any society,” Soleiman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He says he was for Mamdani until studying the issue after a sex worker approached him and his 11-year-old son in their car at a traffic light on Roosevelt Avenue.\n \n\n   \n  “That really pissed me off that day,” Soleiman said. “We were supporting him as a Muslim brother, as a South Asian brother, but then I read through his agenda, and I said wow.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s position on the issue was hazy for weeks, which gave Cuomo an opportunity to ramp up his criticism to suggest Mamdani was flip flopping.\n \n\n   \n  During a recent debate, Mamdani clarified he does not support legalizing sex work. Instead, he says he would support decriminalizing the practice as long as it’s between two consenting adults.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling, who are currently being thrown in jail,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  New York City Councilman Shekar Krishnan, the first Indian American elected to the city council, represents Jackson Heights, which is home to large sectors of the city’s South Asian community. Krishnan backs Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  Krishnan, who represents the Jackson Heights area and is familiar with the sex worker complaints, acknowledged the problems on Roosevelt Avenue but criticized Cuomo for how he’s approaching them.\n \n\n   \n  “To use that as a wedge issue and try to cleave off the South Asian community is deeply misguided because there is something far deeper that is resonating with us,” Krishnan said. “No matter which South Asian community you come from, they’re all in the same struggle, every day I hear from my constituents how hard it is to get by and how unaffordable the city has become.”\n \n\n   \n    A look at Roosevelt Avenue\n \n\n   \n  On an average night in the past month, Mateo Guerrero says he encountered around 15 sex workers nightly on Roosevelt Avenue.\n \n\n   \n  Guerrero, a transgender man who is also a lead organizer at Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights advocacy organization, walks the street at night when gay clubs, bars and 24-hour restaurants light up the avenue.\n \n\n   \n  During his walks, Guerrero tries to connect sex workers to resources, including legal help provided by his organization. He says the best way of finding people who are being victimized is by getting sex workers to believe they can safely seek help and not be subject to arrest or immigration detention.\n \n\n   \n  Make the Road NY and other organizations support a bill in the state legislature known as Cecilia’s Law. The bill, named after Cecilia Gentili, a prominent trans and sex worker rights activist who died last year, would remove penalties for buying to selling sex and keep laws on the books against human trafficking and other crimes involving minors.\n \n\n   \n  “These are people who are trying to survive, trying to get money for the food they eat, they’re surviving as a trans people, women, and they are terrified by police,” Guerrero told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Mayor Eric Adams’ administration launched “Operation Restore Roosevelt” in response to community concerns. Adams said the 8-month operation resulted in a drop in crime, with more than 2,500 arrests, including 397 for prostitution-related offenses.\n \n\n   \n  Guerrero, who did not support the operation, says increased police enforcement sent a chill through a broader community largely made up of undocumented immigrants who fear interactions with police even when they are the victims of a crime.\n \n\n   \n  “The impact was not on sex workers, the impact was on all workers, people who are afraid to go out at night now, afraid to go to the supermarket, afraid to come home from work on the train,” Guerrero said.\n \n\n   \n  Some advocates point out Cuomo  signed  the “Walking While Trans” ban in 2021. The legislation repealed a 1976 law that criminalized loitering for the purpose of prostitution.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  after he signed the repeal, the then-governor referred to the law as “archaic” and argued that people of color and transgender people specifically had been disproportionally policed based on their appearance.\n \n\n   \n  During this year’s mayoral campaign, Cuomo raised Mamdani’s support for decriminalizing the sale of sex between two consenting adults during their first general election debate, saying “the worst thing that could happen” would be to have the practice decriminalized.\n \n\n   \n  “That would be terrible for the quality of life,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has dismissed Cuomo’s attacks as an attempt to sow confusion among voters, arguing Cuomo has only recently spent time in South Asian communities or around Muslim New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo, Mamdani argued, has spent his time “lecturing instead of listening.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/kamala-harris-presidential-run","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-04:00","title":"Kamala Harris hints at another presidential run: ‘I am not done’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled her potential return to the presidential race in 2028, stating 'I am not done' during a BBC interview.

It happens all the time with Republicans in Congress, who have  willingly relegated themselves  to second-class citizens in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  They don’t necessarily endorse what he’s doing, mind you. But they do acquiesce. And sometimes they even do Trump a solid by steering the focus towards a common enemy. Think: Trump’s legally dubious deportation policies, the draconian and rushed DOGE cuts, his pardons of violent January 6 defendants, and his administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n \n\n   \n  But rarely have we seen this dynamic play out like late this week – when the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute effectively  distanced itself from Ronald Reagan’s own words .\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before 9 p.m. ET on Thursday, the Reagan foundation issued a somewhat bizarre statement.\n \n\n   \n  The government of Ontario, Canada, had recently launched an extensive ad campaign against Trump’s tariffs. The campaign includes  a minutelong ad featuring only Reagan’s voice  being run during World Series games. It clipped a number of comments from an April 1987 address Reagan gave decrying the dangers of tariffs and trade wars.\n \n\n   \n  The Reagan foundation’s statement accused Ontario of using “selective audio and video” of Reagan and said it  “misrepresents” the former president’s address .\n \n\n   \n  As remarkable, the foundation said it was “reviewing its legal options” because Ontario didn’t seek or obtain permission to use Reagan’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  Neither of these objections really hold water.\n \n\n   \n  While the ad stitched together a number of comments from Reagan’s address, it  accurately reflected what he said . The sentiments were also  very similar to Reagan’s other comments  on tariffs and free trade in this time period. He sometimes used tariffs, but he generally pitched them as a necessary evil and cautioned strongly against trade wars and protectionism.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan’s sentiments on this topic are a world away from the commentary of Trump, who has pitched tariffs as “beautiful,” trade wars as being “good” and “easy to win,” and such policies as being vital to revitalizing American manufacturing.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation has not responded to a question about what, specifically, it alleges was misrepresented in the ad.\n \n\n   \n  As for the suggestion that there could be some legal claim here? It’s not at all clear what that’s based on, either.\n \n\n   \n  Government footage of presidents is generally public domain. The Ontario ad cites the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library as its source. The library uploaded the clip of Reagan’s April 1987 address to YouTube eight years ago and  listed its access and use as “unrestricted.” \n \n\n   \n  The foundation likewise didn’t respond to a request for insight into its legal considerations.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the practical impact of the statement seems to be mostly seeding unspecified doubt – doubt about Reagan’s words and the actions of Ontario – rather than providing any real clarity or view of Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation later re-posted Trump White House adviser Dan Scavino’s post calling Ontario’s ad campaign an “ anti-tariff PROPAGANDA ad .”\n \n\n   \n  These sentiments are especially remarkable coming from the foundation given, as of just a couple years ago, it and the Trump team  seemed to be at cross-purposes . It’s clear the foundation was doing Trump a real favor.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps no piece of evidence crystallizes how Trump’s trade wars fly in the face of modern conservative orthodoxy like Reagan’s past comments. Here was  the  conservative presidential icon of the modern era saying repeatedly, on tape, things diametrically opposed to Trump’s tariff views.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, even Trump and the White House have previously acknowledged Reagan had a very different view on this subject.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to the Washington Post earlier this year, a White House spokeswoman listed tariffs alongside opposing “amnesty” policies and foreign policy noninterventionism as  key differences in the two presidents’ agendas .\n \n\n   \n  Trump a year ago claimed he was actually “ in a way more conservative than Reagan ” because of his tariffs policies.\n \n\n   \n  But what the Reagan foundation’s posts seemed to suggest was just maybe this Reagan guy wasn’t the free-trader he appeared to be.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was happy to take it from there, going much further in calling the ad “fake” and claiming on social media that Reagan “ actually … LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY .”\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD,” Trump said, while announcing he was cutting off trade talks with Canada over the ads.\n \n\n   \n  Soon, plenty of Trump allies were scouring Reagan’s presidency for pieces of evidence to try and legitimize the claim that Reagan somehow, in fact, loved the tariffs that he spent years deriding.\n \n\n   \n  The Reagan foundation gave Trump ammunition to try and muddy the waters in entirely predictable ways.\n \n\n   \n  But that comes at a cost. To the extent Trump is able to rewrite this portion of history to fuel his trade wars, it comes at the expense of the ideals Reagan spent years advocating. It provides a completely inaccurate picture of the man the foundation is supposed to celebrate.\n \n\n   \n  And in that way, it’s a truly fitting moment in those trade wars.\n \n\n   \n  So many congressional Republicans have set aside years of free-trade evangelism to allow Trump to press forward – this despite the Constitution giving them explicit authority over tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  They, like the Reagan foundation did, often stop well shy of endorsing what Trump is doing. But they’ve effectively greenlit the whole thing by narrowing their commentary and actions in the name of being team players and avoiding Trump’s wrath. They’ve largely held their tongues even after the predictable economic pains caused by the tariffs have jeopardized the economy and the GOP’s hopes of holding congressional majorities in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps they hope it will all just subside one day. Maybe they think the Supreme Court might save them by invalidating the tariffs – and they won’t have had to get their own hands dirty.\n \n\n   \n  But if there’s a moment that suggests the issue has gotten away from them, it might be when Trump is able to paint Reagan as a Trumpian protectionist – with an assist from Reagan’s own foundation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/asia/cambodia-scams-chen-zhi-prince-group-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"The young tycoon accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar international fraud network","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chen Zhi, a 37-year-old Chinese-born tycoon who became a naturalized Cambodian citizen, is accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar transnational fraud network involving forced labor, cryptocurrency scams, and bribery.

EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  He is a baby-faced tycoon who rose to the highest echelons of power in his adopted home of Cambodia, where he bestows scholarships and runs philanthropy programs while overseeing one of the country’s largest and best-connected conglomerates.\n \n\n   \n  But behind this façade, Chen Zhi, 37, runs one of the largest transnational criminal organizations in Asia,  US authorities say , an empire fueled by forced labor and cryptocurrency scams that at one point were allegedly earning Chen and his associates $30 million every day.\n \n\n   \n  The money went on buying Picasso artwork, private jets and properties in upscale neighborhoods of London, ﻿as well as supplying bribes to public officials, according to prosecutors in New York, who last week ﻿ announced  they had seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency from Chen following a years-long investigation.\n \n\n   \n  That action has thrown a rare light on an alleged kingpin of Southeast Asia’s murky and criminal world of online scams, which US authorities say operate under the protection of powerful politicians, and conned victims in the US alone out of at least $10 billion dollars last year.\n \n\n   \n  Chen’s Prince Group employs thousands of people and bills itself as one of the biggest conglomerates in Cambodia, with investments in luxury real estate, banking services, hotels, major construction developments, grocery stores and even luxury watches.\n \n\n   \n  But last week, the company was declared a transnational criminal organization by United States authorities, and Chen  was charged  in absentia in New York with money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, along with several associates.\n \n\n   \n  He is still at large, and currently faces no legal threat in Cambodia, which has no extradition treaty with the US.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Group, American and British authorities allege, was the umbrella for more than 100 shell companies and entities allegedly used to funnel laundered cash across 12 countries and territories from Singapore to St Kitts and Nevis.\n \n\n   \n  “Chen Zhi isn’t a mob boss as we traditionally conceive of them – he is (or rather was) the polished face of a state-protected criminal economy,” said Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center and a transnational crime expert.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Prince Group for comment. CNN has also reached out to the Cambodian government and interior ministry for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Group has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing as “false and defamatory” in statements published on its website. Those statements have since been taken down.\n \n\n   \n    Who is Chen Zhi?\n \n\n   \n  Little was known about Chen, also known as Vincent, until he arrived in Cambodia and began splashing enormous amounts of cash.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in China’s southeastern province of Fujian on December 16, 1987, according to the US Treasury Department.\n \n\n   \n  His first business ventures were reportedly an internet café and gaming centers in the provincial capital Fuzhou. In 2011, he plunged into the “uncharted waters of real estate investment in Cambodia,” according to a profile on the website of DW Capital Holdings, a Singapore-based fund manager that lists Chen as its founder and chairman, and which is among the companies sanctioned by the US.\n \n\n   \n  In those “uncharted waters,” a rush of mainly Chinese developers started building casinos in the western Cambodian city of Sihanoukville in the 2010s, turning the quiet seaside town and backpacker haven into a  roaring gambling mecca,  encouraged by lax regulation and the easy availability of casino licenses.\n \n\n   \n  With the casinos and online gambling came organized crime, money laundering, prostitution, drug trafficking and online scamming. The town was described as a “wild west” where a prolific business-crime nexus emerged.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after his arrival in Cambodia, Chen became a naturalized Cambodian citizen – an option available to applicants who donate $250,000 to the state. Analysts say he acquired venerable titles and rapidly gained influence with the Cambodian elite.\n \n\n   \n  He was elevated to be a senior adviser to the government at the rank of minister, was personal adviser to former Prime Minister Hun Sen, and then his son and successor Hun Manet, and bestowed with the honorific “neak oknha,” a title awarded to prominent businesspeople.\n \n\n   \n  Video posted by the former Cambodian leader shows Chen standing alongside Hun Sen in 2022 during a meeting of investors. Chen was also part of a delegation that traveled with Hun Sen to Cuba in 2022, during which he met Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and was listed as an “adviser” to Hun Sen.\n \n\n   \n  According to the US indictment, Chen also traveled to the US in April 2023 using a diplomatic passport –   a document it alleges Chen obtained after purchasing luxury watches for a senior foreign government official.\n \n\n   \n    Federal investigation reveals wide criminal net\n \n\n   \n  Browse the website of Chen’s Prince Group, and the company’s public image is one of charitable endeavors, business accolades and awards for corporate social responsibility initiatives, large donations to anti-Covid efforts, and education programs.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s charitable trust claims to have donated funds worth $14 million to help Cambodians in a range of initiatives. The company even opened a Prince Horology Vocational Training Center, billed as the country’s first independent watch school.\n \n\n   \n  And it commands a visible presence in the country, with skyscrapers dotting the skylines of Cambodia’s cities. Through its subsidiary Canopy Sands Development, Prince Group has embarked on a $16 billion project near Sihanoukville to develop a 934-hectare “eco city” called the Bay of Lights.\n \n\n   \n  But federal prosectors allege that empire extended to at least 10 forced labor camps in Cambodia, where workers were coerced into carrying out scams “at high volumes” under the threat of violence. The indictment described vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire where incidences of   violence and coercion were “frequent.”\n \n\n   \n  From alleged organized crime investments in Palau to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and Singapore, investigators implicated 146 entities and individuals linked to Chen, his Prince Group and associates.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really remarkable in terms of both the state, the scale and size of what they’ve seized, but also the extent to which they’ve been able to identify and target so many of the different nodes of this particular criminal network,” said Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  As well as Cambodian citizenship, Chen is listed by the US Treasury Department as having passports from Cyprus and the small Pacific island of Vanuatu.\n \n\n   \n  Several of the addresses listed to Chen are in Hong Kong. Construction and engineering services firm Geotech Holdings – which has seven subsidiaries, each sanctioned by the US government – has headquarters in Kwai Chung, home to the city’s container port. The company did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities also allege Chen and his co-conspirators bribed public officials in China and elsewhere to stay ahead of investigations and raids on the forced labor compound. Chen kept ledgers of bribes, according to the indictment, and in 2019 a $3 million yacht was bought for a senior official in an unnamed foreign government.\n \n\n   \n  By approximately 2020, Chen had allegedly amassed a staggering sum of laundered proceeds that included approximately 127,271 bitcoin worth $15 billion across unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys he personally held.\n \n\n   \n  Chen mastered a combination of elite access, patronage and philanthropy “that opened doors across real estate, finance, and politics, ultimately providing him the resources and protection needed to grow his scam empire,” said Sims.\n \n\n   \n    Cambodia as a ‘scam state’\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has been described by analysts as a de facto scam state that risks becoming a global pariah if it fails to act against the criminal networks within its borders.\n \n\n   \n  The global scam industry, estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $70 billion, is evolving at an unprecedented scale, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime  said earlier this year , despite   widely publicized crackdowns on scam compounds in Myanmar.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia, which has emerged as an epicenter of this scam economy, is estimated to make   $12.5 billion to $19 billion a year from cybercrime – equivalent to about 60% of the country’s GDP, according to a  report  published by the Humanity Research Consultancy in May.\n \n\n   \n  In June, an Amnesty International  report  accused the Cambodian government of “deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labour and torture” carried out by criminal gangs in scamming compounds across the country.\n \n\n   \n  And the US State Department named Cambodia a state sponsor of human trafficking in its  2025 Trafficking in Persons report,  which noted that senior Cambodian officials owned properties used by online scam operators to exploit victims.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts estimate there are about 300 scamming compounds in the country with a workforce of up to 200,000 people. Cambodia’s garment and textile industry, long a mainstay of its economy, employs about 1 million people, according to the UN.\n \n\n   \n  The Humanity Research Consultancy report, authored by Sims, goes further, detailing how the Cambodian leadership and Cambodian state institutions are “deeply and directly implicated in the growth, durability, and flourishing” of the country’s scam industry.\n \n\n   \n  “The charges focus on Chen and Prince, not the state per se, but the pattern is unmistakable: you don’t build ten forced-labor scam compounds, move billions, and buy impunity without political protection,” Sims said. “It is impossible to imagine that such vast wealth would be moving through the system without the explicit knowledge and participation of its strongman and his immediate circle.”\n \n\n   \n  The criminal operations have gone largely unchallenged in Cambodia due to the complete dismantling in recent years of the country’s civil society and independent media.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, the arrest of prominent Cambodian journalist Mech Dara, who helped expose the human trafficking fueling  online scam centers , prompted widespread international concern.\n \n\n   \n  “Civil society in Cambodia has been decimated,” said GI-TOC’s Tower. “And anyone who goes and reports on this issue now they’re silenced. So there’s no space to report on the scam economy, or to raise these issues in the media, civil society can’t touch it.”\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government has repeatedly denied any link to the cybercrime industry, and  said this month  that it is “committed to preventing and suppressing all forms of cross-border crimes, particularly online scams.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Prime Minister   Hun Manet established a commission to target the scammers. The government says it has led to the arrest of 3,455 suspects, of 20 nationalities, accused of cybercrime. Authorities also say they have broken up several organized crime and trafficking networks, rescuing human trafficking victims in the process.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not protect individuals who violate the law,” Cambodia’s Interior Ministry spokesman Touch Sokhak told  the Associated Press  news agency regarding Chen. He stressed that Cambodia’s government itself does not accuse Prince Group﻿   or Chen of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The ministry has also  rejected  reports that Interior Minister Sar Sokha is a co-investor in the Jin Bei Casino Company – which the US Treasury said runs “among the most notorious” of Prince Group’s scam compounds. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Cambodia  said it was  “taking careful monitoring and investigation measures” to ensure Prince Group’s financial services arm Prince Bank “complies with Cambodian laws.”\n \n\n   \n    Where does Cambodia go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia is “at a crossroads,” said Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The UK-US action “sends a very strong signal to both the criminal networks, as well as to those elites in Cambodia that are protecting them, and sponsoring them… that this type of impunity is not going to continue, that your assets are no longer safe. And so, I think it is potentially a game changer,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  Regional countries have begun to act against the crime flourishing inside Cambodia’s borders that has ensnared their citizens.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea last week issued a travel ban for parts of Cambodia after the death of a South Korean student lured to work in the scam compounds, according to police. More than 60 South Korean nationals were deported from Cambodia and police are seeking to detain most of them over allegations they were involved in online scams.\n \n\n   \n  Chen is at large, with a net worth somewhere in the tens of billions, analysts believe. And the scam compounds in Cambodia continue to operate, stealing money from victims including US citizens.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like there’s an off button that you can push to stop all of these scam centers,” said Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The question now turns to whether the US, UK and their allies can use the leverage from their joint operation effectively to dismantle the highly lucrative industry.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the first time Washington and London have hit the architecture – the elite ownership, the laundering conduits, and the money itself – at the very top,” Sims said.\n \n\n   \n  “Blunting (Cambodia’s) ability to operate as a de facto scam state will not only materially disrupt the crime today, it will also serve as an effective deterrent model as this crime continues to spread globally,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Now is the time to keep the pedal down.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/sport/basketball-nba-heat-trail-blazers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00.000Z","title":"Miami Heat and Portland Trail Blazers win first games after being rocked by gambling scandal","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Miami Heat and Portland Trail Blazers won their first games of the 2025 NBA season after being severely impacted by a gambling scandal involving guard Terry Rozier and head coach Chauncey Billups, both of whom were arrested in connection with federal gambling investigations.

Blazers win first games after being rocked by gambling scandal \n       \n  By Issy Ronald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Miami Heat and  Portland Trail Blazers  both won their first games since Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested on Thursday in connection with  two separate federal gambling investigations  announced by the Eastern District of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Under the stewardship of interim coach Tiago Splitter, the Blazers  defeated the Golden State Warriors 139-119 while the Heat eased to a 146-114 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.\n \n\n   \n  Both franchises have endured a difficult opening week to the NBA season, finding themselves embroiled in a  scandal  which has rocked the world of sport.\n \n\n   \n  And, as players and coaches spoke to reporters before and after Friday’s games, they outlined the palpable sense of shock which surrounds the league.\n \n\n   \n  That shock was shared by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver who, in his first public comments on the scandal, said he had “a pit in his stomach” when he heard the news.\n \n\n   \n  “My initial reaction was I was deeply disturbed,” he told broadcaster Amazon Prime Video during the Boston Celtics’ game against the New York Knicks. “There’s nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition… It was very upsetting.”\n \n\n   \n  Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, was charged in an elaborate, mafia-linked scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Trail Blazers and the Heat on Thursday. The Heat directed press inquiries to the  NBA’s statement  while the Trail Blazers noted that Splitter would take on interim head coaching duties.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly shorn of their head coach, the Blazers were downbeat but determined on Friday. “It’s not an easy situation,” said forward Deni Avdija, per AP. “We really love Chauncey and what he’s done for this organization. I don’t know the details and I don’t really want to get into that. I’m trying to focus on the game.”\n \n\n   \n  Attempting to block out everything off the court and focusing on basketball seems to be a strategy filtering down from Splitter who remained guarded in his press conference after the game when asked about Billups.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to talk about basketball, just do what we do, play the way we’d like to play… I spoke in the morning (about Billups) but that’s it,” Splitter told reporters. “Life stuff happens and next step is basketball and doing our job.”\n \n\n   \n  “(We’re) trying to focus on the basketball part,” he added. “But these guys are human beings and we understand that, but trying to focus on basketball.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Rozier was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability while a member of the Charlotte Hornets. Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  His teammate Bam Adebayo, who added 24 points against the Grizzlies, stressed that Rozier still had the support of the Heat, saying: “(We) support him through and through. That’s our brother at the end of the day … We stand behind him.”\n \n\n   \n  “It felt kind of weird without him being here, actually, because he’s the first person I get to talk to in the morning. He brings that great energy to our team,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “Terry is somebody who is very dear to all of us,” said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. “He’s had a real positive impact on our locker room … We send our thoughts and our care for him as he goes through this.”\n \n\n   \n  Rozier was investigated by the NBA in 2023 over the same allegations for which he has now been indicted, as part of the inquiry which led to the lifetime ban of Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter.\n \n\n   \n  Regarding Rozier’s case, Silver defended the league’s process which “ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  “He still hasn’t been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry,” Silver added. “Obviously, it doesn’t look good, but he’s now been put on administrative leave. There’s a balance here of protecting people’s rights and investigating, and as I said, we’ve been working with the government, and they have extraordinary powers that a league office doesn’t have.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/furloughed-federal-workers-unemployment-claims","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"11:09:00-04:00","title":"Furloughed federal workers file for jobless benefits, but aid isn’t easy to get","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown, over 20,000 furloughed federal workers have filed for unemployment benefits, a significant increase from previous periods. However, access to these benefits is extremely difficult due to administrative hurdles, including the lack of federal payroll data for state unemployment offices, delays in processing, and the need for identity and wage verification. Only a small fraction of furloughed employees have applied, due to complexity, wait times, and the fact that benefits are minimal—ranging from $378 to $444 per week—insufficient to cover basic expenses.

workers file for jobless benefits, but aid isn’t easy to get \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Angélica Franganillo Díaz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:09 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Right after setting her out-of-office email on October 1, one furloughed US Department of Agriculture worker filed for unemployment benefits to help her pay for food, rent and other necessities during the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  More than three weeks later, her application is still listed as pending – forcing her to borrow from family and friends as the impasse continues with no end in sight. The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance told her she may have to wait up to three months to receive her first payment, though she will receive a lump sum for all the missed weeks of claims.\n \n\n   \n  “But that doesn’t help me now,”  said the worker, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation. “The rent is due on November 1.”\n \n\n   \n  The USDA staffer is among the nearly 20,600 furloughed federal employees who have filed for unemployment benefits during the first three weeks of the shutdown, according to Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. Initial jobless claims for federal workers have soared to their highest level since the record 35-day shutdown that ended in January 2019.\n \n\n   \n  That compares to 635 initial claims filed by federal workers for the week ending September 13, according to the most recent data published by the US Department of Labor before the impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland and Texas have the highest number of initial claims, with more than 3,100 filings each, said Stettner, who analyzed unemployment data filed in 49 states and territories.\n \n\n   \n  More workers are expected to file for unemployment compensation in the coming weeks since many  missed their first full paychecks  on Friday and more will do so in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike in previous shutdowns, many are concerned that they may not receive back pay or have a job to go back to after the shutdown ends. The Trump administration has called into question a  2019 law  that guarantees retroactive compensation for furloughed workers and has tried to  lay off more  than 4,000 workers during the impasse. (A federal judge recently  paused  the administration’s efforts to downsize the federal workforce during the shutdown.)\n \n\n   \n  Still, only a small share of the estimated 670,000 furloughed federal employees have applied for jobless benefits. There are multiple reasons why most of them don’t file claims, including the hassle in having their wages verified, the delay in getting payments and the fact that they’ll have to repay the benefits once the shutdown ends and they receive their back pay.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, the benefits are only a fraction of what many federal workers receive in compensation. The maximum weekly payment in Washington, DC, is $444, $430 in Maryland and only $378 in Virginia, for instance.\n \n\n   \n    Extra steps needed\n \n\n   \n  The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program is similar to traditional state jobless benefits, but it differs in significant ways that could delay getting money into the hands of furloughed staffers.\n \n\n   \n  State unemployment offices have the wage records of private-sector employers, but they don’t have that information for the federal government. So, the states must contact the federal agencies to verify the employment and salary for each claimant. But many of the workers who would handle such requests have been furloughed themselves, said Stettner, who also served as a senior US Department of Labor official in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Federal workers should apply for unemployment benefits. They don’t know how long the shutdown is going to be,” he said, noting it’s akin to an interest-free loan. “But it’s really, really hard. There are a lot of barriers.”\n \n\n   \n  Some states are trying to smooth the process for furloughed workers. Washington’s Employment Security Department, which has had more than 1,800 federal employees file for benefits, held a webinar earlier this week that drew nearly 500 participants and is offering another one next week. Maryland’s Department of Labor has a  webpage  specifically for furloughed federal staffers and contractors. Utah’s Department of Workforce Services posted an  FAQ  for affected federal employees on its site.\n \n\n   \n    Frustrating experiences\n \n\n   \n  Ben Emmel, a senior analyst at the Government Accountability Office, decided to file for unemployment benefits two weeks ago, but the Maryland resident was only able to submit his application on Friday because he had to resolve an identity verification issue first.\n \n\n   \n  Several of his colleagues around the country have also had problems filing claims, said Emmel, who is president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\n \n\n   \n  Even when he gets the benefits, the weekly payment will only cover a trip or two to the grocery store for Emmel, who is married with four young children.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees aren’t the only ones being hit hard by the shutdown. Many contractors who work for federal agencies have also been furloughed, although they don’t have the same guarantee of getting their back pay that federal staffers do.\n \n\n   \n   Contractors  can also run into issues filing for jobless benefits. Sharon, a contractor for the Drug Enforcement Administration, visited a Washington, DC, unemployment office after having difficulty applying online. After waiting in line, she still didn’t get clear answers about her eligibility or next steps.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m super frustrated,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/business/tech-workers-jobs-fed","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-04:00","title":"The Fed Can’t Help America’s Young Tech Workers Who Are Struggling to Find a Job","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of thousands of young American computer science graduates are struggling to find jobs due to a structural shift in the tech labor market driven by AI automation and economic uncertainty.

\n       \n  By Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of young Americans fresh out of college with a computer science degree have struggled to find a job over the past year. And their luck may not change anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Reserve began to lower interest rates  last month  to support the labor market and is expected to deliver another rate cut  in the coming days.  Companies across most industries, including technology, have pumped the brakes on hiring this year, hesitant to make those kinds of investments without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump’s sweeping economic policies.\n \n\n   \n  A string of rate cuts should eventually bolster hiring by making it more feasible for companies to expand headcounts. But lower rates cannot easily counteract the economic uncertainty that continues to bedevil businesses or address AI’s structural impact on entry-level tech jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Layoffs and reductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workers with a college degree,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said during an October 15 event in Arlington, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “For policymakers, we must let the disruption occur and trust that the long-run benefits will exceed any short-run costs,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Rate cuts do nothing about the bigger issue for hiring\n \n\n   \n  Lower interest rates typically incentivize companies to staff up. But businesses also need clarity on future costs when developing hiring plans, a challenging task amid Trump’s ongoing bid to reshape global trade.\n \n\n   \n  “The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “So long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know how many people you should hire.”\n \n\n   \n  The situation has stabilized somewhat since the spring when Trump unveiled his massive Liberation Day tariffs. The Trump administration has announced a handful of successful trade deals since then, but Trump’s trade war is far from settled. On Thursday, the president  called off trade talks with Canada  after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff ad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also  lashed out at China  over its restrictions on rare earth exports and his administration is launching a probe looking into whether China complied with a trade agreement from 2019. Trump is expected to have a wide-ranging discussion with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during an upcoming meeting in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, businesses of all sizes and across most   industries are still unsure of what the future might hold as US trade policy continues to evolve, even with the Fed expected to deliver additional rate cuts through 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s still policy uncertainty, but everyone realizes substantial tariffs are now most likely here to stay. And now we have to navigate it,” Rich Lesser, Boston Consulting Group’s global chair, said in  an analysis of third-quarter earnings calls by BCG and Bloomberg Media Studios. \n \n\n   \n  A  survey of 130 CEOs  released on October 16 by the Conference Board, showed that their expectations for the economy in the next six months “turned from neutral to pessimistic,” and that 68% said they plan to maintain or shrink the size of their workforce.\n \n\n   \n    The entry-level tech job crisis and the Fed\n \n\n   \n  AI is beginning to automate some tasks usually done by an entry-level technology worker, possibly resulting in a structural shift in the technology industry’s labor market. And tech companies are increasingly adopting the technology; a Google study from September found that  90% of tech workers are using AI at work .\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly, functions through demand, not supply. That means it’s good at boosting demand to shore up the labor market, which is currently what the central bank is trying to do, but it does nothing about supply-side issues.\n \n\n   \n  “You do have a bit of a mismatch,” said David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura. “You have a lot of people who are new (computer science) graduates from college, but there doesn’t seem to be enough demand for these entry-level workers.”\n \n\n   \n  Job postings in the technology and mathematics industry on Indeed were down 35% in early October compared to February 2020, with certain titles, such as developers and designers,  seeing the steepest declines.   Meanwhile, AI and data center-focused roles have seen a massive increase in job postings during the same period.\n \n\n   \n  “Higher unemployment among recent college graduates is primarily a function of a structural shift in hiring in the tech sector amid strong labor supply growth,” Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in  an analyst note  published earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Computer and mathematical science occupations are disproportionately exposed to automation and displacement,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The Conference Board’s latest CEO survey showed that most of the business leaders surveyed expect AI “to fundamentally transform over 50% of the job roles in their organization in the next 5 years.”\n \n\n   \n  Young Americans who studied computer science for the promise of a good-paying job are now grappling with the harsh economics that come with a new, disruptive technology.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels like I’m competing with AI to just try to get my foot in the door,” Abraham Rubio, who graduated with a degree in computer science and game programming from Bloomfield College of Montclair State University in New Jersey earlier this year,  told CNN previously. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/business/this-is-how-sports-gaming-has-become-crucial-to-leagues-bottom-lines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Do Recent Sports Gambling Scandals Mean the End of Leagues’ Deals with Sportsbook Apps?

It’s a longshot \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n     American sports suffered another black eye after the arrests this week of an NBA coach and a current NBA player for their alleged ties to illegal sports betting and rigged poker games.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest example of gambling and players breaking the rules. But for those who think this means leagues and teams will step back from their ties to sports gaming apps, here are four words for you: don’t bet on it.\n \n\n   \n  Direct sponsorship deals between various legal sports books and the top American sports leagues are worth billions of dollars spread over several years and likely more than $1 billion annually, said Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross and an expert on the business of sports and gambling.\n \n\n   \n  Such sponsorship deals are “clearly very important” to the finances of sports leagues and teams, Matheson said. No matter how rich leagues are, the gambling sponsorships are “not something that anyone wants to turn down.”\n \n\n   \n  Once states started legalizing sports gambling following a  2018 Supreme Court ruling , sponsorship deals soon followed. Now, all of the major US sports leagues and most individual teams have such sponsorship deals. Numerous teams, including the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals, MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks and the NBA’s Washington Wizards, have signed deals to put physical betting shops inside their stadiums and arenas, Matheson noted.\n \n\n   \n  Legal wagers on sports grew to $160 billion last year in the United States —far more than the just over $100 billion spent on lottery tickets, according to Matheson. Gross gambling revenue, which is the amount wagered less than the amount paid out on winning bets, grew to $13.7 billion, up 23% from 2023, according to the American Gaming Association, an industry trade group. Most of that is wagered online, not in physical casinos.\n \n\n   \n    Big money beyond sponsorships\n \n\n   \n  Sports gambling has become a huge industry in less than a decade, and it’s still growing. It’s not surprising that much of that money is spilling into the sports teams’ coffers.\n \n\n   \n  “The raw numbers (of sports gambling) — I don’t think — are eye-popping yet,” said Michael Lewis, author of “Moneyball” and “The Blind Side,” and whose podcast “Against the Rules” just did a season about sports gambling. “But the fact that it’s new revenue — and new revenues are hard to find — has got everybody way excited about it.”\n \n\n   \n  But   that direct support brought in via sponsorships is only a fraction of the billions that teams and leagues get because fans are betting on games. The sports books spend hundreds of millions on advertising annually, primarily during games, along with pregame and post-game shows, according to  MediaRadar,  which tracks and estimates ad spending. That lifts the networks’ or streaming services’ revenue — and thus the rights fees they’re willing to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Betting drives more overall revenue for sports, thus further lifting broadcast and streaming rights deals into the tens of billions.    And that’s all the more important in this age of declining viewership, when all forms of entertainment are fighting for the public’s attention.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a way to keep fans engaged in meaningless games,” said Lewis. “In an era when people’s attention spans seem to shrink by the moment … this is like the future of the way that a fan engages with the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  Unlike professional leagues and teams, the NCAA doesn’t have sponsorship deals with sports books. In a case of bad timing, just before Thursday’s news broke of the NBA scandal, the NCAA announced it would allow college athletes and staff to  bet on professional sports  starting November 1.\n \n\n   \n  But even as the NCAA continues to keep its distance from sports gambling and prohibits players from betting on college sports, the NCAA benefits from the huge fan interest and viewership in its “March Madness” basketball tournaments. Even casual fans have money riding on the games’ outcomes, bringing in an estimated $3.1 billion in wagers in 2024, according to the American Gaming Association.\n \n\n   \n  “How do you convince networks to pay a billion dollars a year for college basketball? It’s because a ton of people tune in,” Matheson said. “And why do so many people tune in to college basketball during March Madness? It’s because obviously everyone builds out a bracket, right? So that’s a perfect example of indirect benefits.”\n \n\n   \n    A different kind of wagers\n \n\n   \n  Legalized sports gambling was mostly limited to Las Vegas casinos until a Supreme Court decision in 2018 opened the door for it nationwide. But there has always been gambling in   sports, Matheson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have clear evidence of gambling in the ancient Olympics that started in 776 BC,” he said. “So, sports betting is basically as old as organized sports itself.”\n \n\n   \n  But this is a form of gambling that wasn’t available in the past, with fans having the chance to bet on small occurrences within a game through what is known as prop bets, and not just on the final outcome.\n \n\n   \n  “This is way different from the seventh century BC,” said Lewis. “This is having a casino in your pocket.”\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s criminal charges suggest that the leagues weren’t prepared for the risks of bad actions by some of the players, said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of “Losing Big: America’s Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling.”\n \n\n   \n  “Leagues sort of wandered into this sort of not really knowing what they’re getting into, just knowing that they could make a lot of money off of it,” Cohen told CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “It just speaks to this sort of recklessness with which we dove in,” Cohen said. “I think we should have legal sports betting. We should maybe even have legal online sports betting. But it didn’t have to be this way if we had just taken a more careful approach.”\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s arrests and charges involving the NBA follow suspensions of two Cleveland Guardians pitchers this summer from an  MLB probe of sports betting , and suspensions in 2023 of six NFL players for  gambling on league games .\n \n\n   \n  All of these incidents pose risks for leagues that have come to love and depend on the revenue they get from betting apps.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that (leagues) are going to poison their sports if they don’t watch out,” said Lewis. “We’re not at the place where people are genuinely questioning the integrity of the sport. But we’re not that far away.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Auzinea Bacon contributed to this report \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/us/immigration-crackdown-car-crashes-rammings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"08:30:00-04:00","title":"Car crashes and rammings take center stage in immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has been characterized by dramatic and dangerous vehicle-related incidents, including crashes, shootings, and aggressive law enforcement tactics such as PIT maneuvers.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:30 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration’s  crackdown on illegal immigration  often looks like a car crash.\n \n\n   \n  Literally.\n \n\n   \n  There have been car crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee. There have been alleged “rammings” involving pro-immigrant activists. There have been dramatic traffic stops featuring smashed windows and law enforcement shootings. Even the standoffs outside ICE facilities have focused on tense moments around the arrival or departure of federal vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  These incidents, many captured on video, have provided some of the most dramatic visuals of the immigration crackdown this year.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re the most highly visible, and I think they’re so unusual that it shocks the psyche to see federal agents making administrative warrant arrests and using potential deadly force tactics,” said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the  Council on Criminal Justice , a nonpartisan think tank.\n \n\n   \n  The crashes show federal law enforcement’s use of aggressive tactics in busy city streets, such as dangerous “PIT” maneuvers, unmarked cars and masked officers, law enforcement and immigration   experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The collisions also reflect the desperate fear of the immigration targets, who in some cases have tried to flee when faced with the potential end of their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  “Often people in their cars get scared and they try to drive away, knowing that stopping and talking to ICE might end up in a severe violation of their constitutional rights and arrest and detention,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director of the  American Immigration Council , a pro-immigration nonprofit group.\n \n\n   \n  “This kind of interaction on the streets – using traffic stops, people fearful when ICE or federal agents are following them – leads to the kinds of accidents and crashes that we’re starting to see in the news.”\n \n\n   \n  Bill Essayli, acting US attorney for the Central District of California, noted  in a post on X on Tuesday  that “encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  “PSA: A vehicle is a deadly weapon,” Essayli said. “Using it against law enforcement justifies their use of deadly force in self-defense. If you wish to challenge law enforcement actions, do so in court, not on the streets.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Vehicles used as arrest tactic\n \n\n   \n  Some of these car crashes have been initiated by federal agents and show a willingness to use  aggressive and potentially dangerous tactics .\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago on October 14, US Border Patrol agents  pursued and crashed into a vehicle  as part of an immigration enforcement operation, leading to an angry response from community residents.\n \n\n   \n  The incident unfolded when a white SUV hit the side of a red SUV, sending it backward through the intersection before it   crashed into another vehicle, video captured by a nearby resident showed. What appeared to be federal agents can then be seen exiting the white vehicle and chasing two people.\n \n\n   \n  The red SUV was driven by a person in the country illegally who rammed a Border Patrol vehicle before trying to flee the scene, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN. Agents used “an authorized precision immobilization technique (PIT) maneuver,” which forces a vehicle to spin out and stop, said DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents eventually arrested the two individuals, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  A PIT maneuver is considered a use of deadly force and is justifiable in certain situations, depending on the suspect’s risk to the public, the risk to the officer and the potential collateral damage of a crash, according to Jerry Robinette, a former special agent in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a series of factors that agents have to take into account before they even become involved in a high-risk pursuit,” he said. “When you’re involved in a high-risk pursuit, one of your main responsibilities is the general public, along with yourself and the violator.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of an October 16 crash in  Oxnard, California , also shows federal agents performing what appears to be an intentional crash.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the incident shows a dark gray truck driving in circles with an unmarked beige SUV closely following him around. Once the truck begins driving straight, the beige SUV speeds up and slams into the truck’s back-left side. It is not immediately clear what happened before the video starts.\n \n\n   \n  Leo Martinez, the driver of the truck, is a US citizen and an  immigration rights volunteer . He told CNN’s Erin Burnett last week he is one of multiple volunteers who have been patrolling neighborhoods in Ventura County to document ICE detentions and was shocked when the SUV he says was driven by federal agents drove into his truck.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez told CNN he was temporarily detained him and then released from custody pending charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security responded to the incident in a statement, calling it a “targeted enforcement operation.”\n \n\n   \n    Crashes and traffic stops have led to shootings\n \n\n   \n  Traffic stops and car chases have long been considered some of the most dangerous of law enforcement   activities, and indeed some of these crashes have led to injuries and death.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, an  ICE officer fatally shot a man  who DHS said resisted arrest and dragged the officer during a vehicle stop in a Chicago suburb, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, was an undocumented immigrant, according to DHS. The officer, who was not immediately identified, was released from the hospital after suffering injuries, an ICE spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  In another incident, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old US citizen, was  shot five times  by a US Customs and Border Protection agent after her vehicle and a federal law enforcement vehicle collided on October 4 in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  A federal criminal complaint accuses Martinez of ramming her car into the federal vehicle, and a DHS official referred to her as a “domestic terrorist.” However, her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows the federal agent swerved into her vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting, resisting, and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  In Los Angeles earlier this week, a federal marshal and an undocumented immigrant were injured after an agent’s weapon discharged during an immigration enforcement operation, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors allege  Carlitos Ricardo Parias , a TikTok influencer, rammed law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to dislodge his car during an immigration arrest. Authorities said Parias is a 44-year-old Mexican national living illegally in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Parias been charged with assault on a federal officer, according to a  statement  from the US Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very pacifist man. He’s very calm,” his lawyer Carlos Jurado told  CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS . “A lot of the police officers here know him. They know that he’s very respectful.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators believe gunfire erupted after an ICE officer confronted the suspect’s vehicle and smashed a window with their service weapon, a law enforcement source said. While attempting to grab the suspect, authorities believe the agent’s weapon discharged, striking both the suspect and a deputy US marshal. They are both expected to recover, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the mistrust of immigration enforcement can be dangerous for both suspects and officers, said Johnson, the senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice.\n \n\n   \n  “People are afraid,” he said. “If you’re afraid and you don’t trust the authorities – fight, flight or fear. Those responses to fear can get you killed or get officers hurt.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/us/la-fire-chief-jaime-moore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"08:11:00-04:00","title":"LA Mayor Picks New Fire Chief to Fill Void Following Most Destructive Wildfire in City History","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Jaime Moore, a 30-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department, as the new fire chief following the devastating Palisades Fire of January 2023, which destroyed nearly 8,000 homes and killed at least 12 people.

\n       \n  By Associated Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:11 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has picked a 30-year fire department veteran as the new fire chief months after she ousted the  previous chief  over handling of the most destructive wildfire in the city’s history.\n \n\n   \n  Bass announced Friday she was selecting deputy chief Jaime Moore to take the reins of the Los Angeles Fire Department after a nationwide search with more than 100 candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Moore will inherit a department that has faced scrutiny over its response to the  Palisades Fire, which began during heavy winds  January 7, destroying or damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing at least 12 people in the affluent LA neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Bass, a first-term Democrat seeking reelection, fired then-fire chief Kristin Crowley six weeks after the blaze amid a public rift over preparations for a potential blaze and finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for the devastation.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said he will work to implement strategic changes such as preparation for major disasters and world events, improving morale and culture, and ensuring the department has adequate staffing and resources.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m proud to appoint an Angeleno to this role, and I know that he will work to improve the LAFD for everyone in this city,” Bass said.\n \n\n   \n  The firefighters union quickly applauded Moore’s appointment.\n \n\n   \n  “Throughout his career with the LAFD, Chief Moore has shown strong leadership and a deep commitment to the department,” the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City wrote on X. “His background and experience within the ranks has demonstrated that he’s the right leader at the right time to move the LAFD forward.”\n \n\n   \n  Moore currently oversees operations for the Valley Bureau, covering a northern swath of the city that includes 39 fire stations and over 980 sworn personnel, according to his fire department biography. He joined the LAFD in May 1995 and has worked in a multitude of areas within the department throughout the years. In 2018, he was promoted to assistant chief.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in Delhi, Louisiana, but has spent his entire life in Southern California. His mother was an immigrant from Guadalajara, Mexico, and he was raised speaking English and Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  He earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles and a master’s degree in public administration and emergency management from California State University, Long Beach.\n \n\n   \n  The appointment comes at a critical political juncture for Bass, as she positions herself for a reelection run next year after a difficult first term.\n \n\n   \n  City Hall has struggled with a shortage of cash and a continuing homeless crisis with the 2028 Olympics on the horizon, while continuing to rebuild from the January fires.\n \n\n   \n  Crowley, the department’s first female chief, was named chief in 2022 by Bass’ predecessor at a time when the department was  in turmoil  over allegations of rampant harassment, hazing and discrimination. She worked for the city fire department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.\n \n\n   \n  Fire officials, including Crowley, expressed concerns over budget cuts that left the department understaffed and fire trucks sitting idle in the maintenance yard because they didn’t have mechanics to fix them. The firefighters union sharply criticized Bass’ decision, calling Crowley a “scapegoat.”\n \n\n   \n  Crowley filed a legal claim against the city in August accusing Bass of an “orchestrated campaign of misinformation, defamation and retaliation” after the wildfires.\n \n\n   \n  Federal investigators have determined that the Palisades Fire was ignited from a smaller fire that was set about a week earlier on New Year’s Day. A man accused of sparking the fire  pleaded not guilty  Thursday to federal charges. His attorney has blamed the LAFD for not fully extinguishing the initial fire, while fire officials have said such fires linger deep underground and are impossible to detect.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/africa/ivory-coast-polls-ouattara-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"06:20:00-04:00","title":"Polls open in Ivory Coast as incumbent Ouattara seeks a fourth term amid a weakened opposition","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal election on October 25, 2025, Ivory Coast held a presidential vote where incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, aged 83, seeks a fourth term, extending his rule to nearly two decades.

Roosevelt’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n   According to The White House Historical Association , Roosevelt enjoyed watching World War II-era news reels in the former cloakroom in the East Terrace at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, “and took special interest in the battles fought in Europe and Asia.”\n \n\n   \n  The 32nd US president demonstrated an understanding of the importance of pop culture, including movies.\n \n\n   \n  “Entertainment is always a national asset,” Roosevelt  said in 1943  as the United States was engaged in WWII. “Invaluable in time of peace, it is indispensable in wartime.”\n \n\n   \n  Not that there weren’t movies shown in the White House before that.\n \n\n   \n  Well before the installation of the White House Family Theater, then-President Woodrow Wilson screened 1915’s “The Birth of a Nation,” with the film projected onto the walls of the East Room.\n \n\n   \n  Later presidents greatly enjoyed showing movies in the theater, and  the George W. Bush Library  detailed that film screenings would run the gamut from official events with members of the public invited as guests to “private events and intended for the enjoyment of the President, his family, and his close friends and staff.”\n \n\n   \n  “The best perk out in the White House is not Air Force One or Camp David or anything else,”  said former President Bill Clinton . “It’s the wonderful movie theatre I get here, because people send me these movies all the time.”\n \n\n   \n  The 42-seat theater had different looks over the years.  Business Insider reported  that “it went from green chairs and mustard curtains to white chairs and floral drapes” before donning its most recent “all-red design.”\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes referred to as the “first movie theatre,” it hosted a variety of genres of film.\n \n\n   \n  In January 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter  let it be known  that only “family friendly” films should be shown, which was short-lived when, the following Christmas, he unwittingly screened an X-rated picture at the White House – John Schlesinger’s Oscar-winning “Midnight Cowboy,” which tells the story of a male prostitute in the underbelly of 1960s-era in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  In 2011,  Steven Spielberg talked  about screening his hit 1982 film “E.T.” for then-President Ronald Reagan.\n \n\n   \n  The famed director said those present were “the President, the First Lady and all of their guests, which included Sandra Day O’Connor in her first week of as a Justice of the Supreme Court, and it included some astronauts… I think Neil Armstrong was there, I’m not 100% certain, but it was an amazing, amazing evening.”\n \n\n   \n  “(Reagan) just stood up and he looked around the room, almost like he was doing a headcount, and he said, ‘I wanted to thank you for bringing “E.T.” to the White House. We really enjoyed your movie,’ and then he looked around the room and said, ‘And there are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true,’” Spielberg recalled. “And he said it without smiling! But he said that and everybody laughed, by the way. The whole room laughed because he presented it like a joke, but he wasn’t smiling as he said it.”\n \n\n   \n  The only complaint Reagan had about the film, Spielberg added, was that the closing credits were too long.\n \n\n   \n  The White House Family Theater is one of several historically significant East Wing features that have been destroyed to make way for Trump’s ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  The wing traditionally served as the office of the First Lady, and previously housed a portico as well as a colonnade that led to the Executive Residence.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/europe/ukraine-russia-militaries-improvise-missiles-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:42:00-04:00","title":"Jet-powered bombs and planes-turned-missiles: Ukrainian and Russian militaries improvise and adapt in a battle of wits","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, both militaries are rapidly adapting through improvisation and innovation.

planes-turned-missiles: Ukrainian and Russian militaries improvise and adapt in a battle of wits \n       \n  By Tim Lister, Victoria Butenko, Kosta Gak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:42 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Improvise and innovate have become the watchwords for both the  Russian and Ukrainian militaries  as they try to outwit each other on the ground, at sea and in the air.\n \n\n   \n  Several recent developments illustrate this constant evolution of tactics and weaponry: a new Russian jet-powered bomb, the  Ukrainian  use of light planes as long-range ‘suicide bombs,’ and a fresh generation of maritime drones.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries are exploiting AI, robotics and unmanned systems at a high tempo.\n \n\n   \n  But some innovations are remarkably low-tech.\n \n\n   \n  As night fell on one Ukrainian airfield earlier this month, a small group of men assembled a pilot-less light plane for a 2,000-kilometer (1,243-mile) mission deep into Russia. Its target was in the Russian industrial city of Dzerzhinsk, about 230 miles east of Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  Strapped to its undercarriage was a very basic bomb.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the single-engined plane took off into the night sky, a  large fire  was reported at an explosives factory in Dzerzhinsk that makes shells for the Russian military.\n \n\n   \n  The program was created by an aviation enthusiast with the call-sign Goronych and converts single-seater planes into rudimentary but effective long-range missiles. Instead of a pilot’s seat, there is an additional fuel tank and batteries that power navigation and communication systems, according to a report by the Ukrainian outlet  Babel  that CNN has confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Goronych and his group are now integrated into the 14th regiment of Ukraine’s special operations forces ,  who spoke with CNN about their work. On Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military, they were involved in an attack on a mechanical plant in the Russian city of Saransk – nearly 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the Ukrainian border – where detonators and mines are manufactured.\n \n\n   \n  The Goronych project represents one of dozens of adaptations made by both sides as the conflict has worn on – especially using light aircraft and drones.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the Ukrainian military’s chief of staff, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said light aircraft mounted with machine guns were proving effective in intercepting Russian drones and the military would consider buying more.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians recently began deploying small planes equipped with machine guns in occupied territory to take down Ukrainian drones on their way to targets in Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Their mistake was profiling them on television.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian Security Service established where the planes were based and said on Tuesday that it had “neutralized two small aircraft that the occupiers stationed at airfields and used to shoot down Ukrainian long-range drones.”\n \n\n   \n  Not all innovations are as basic.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Russia has begun deploying a new jet-powered guided bomb, adapted from its huge stocks of old “free-fall” bombs, according to Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (DI).\n \n\n   \n  “The range and combat radius of such bombs will be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles),” said the deputy head of DI, Vadym Skybitski, in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians had already been converting Soviet-era bombs into glide munitions with a range of some 80 kilometers (50 miles), allowing aircraft to fire them while staying well clear of Ukrainian air defenses. On just one day last week, nearly 300 such bombs were fired against Ukraine. The daily average is just over 100, according to the Ukrainian General Staff.\n \n\n   \n  The new longer-range variant – dubbed the UMPB-5 – has already been used in strikes against Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine in recent days. A  Russian aviation blogger  posted on Monday that the weapon was “already being used against the Ukrainians… Now they will put it into production and things will really heat up.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainians have pioneered the development of maritime drones, which have been especially effective against Russia’s Black Sea fleet. This week, the Security Service (SBU) unveiled the latest generation.\n \n\n   \n  One of them was used in an attack on the bridge linking Russia and occupied Crimea  in June , the SBU said. The updated models are capable of traveling more than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), and can carry up to 2,000 kilograms (4,409lbs) of explosives. They can also carry a multiple rocket launcher system.\n \n\n   \n  In the early days of the conflict, the Ukrainian military was much more agile than Russian forces in terms of adapting tactics and equipment. But over time, said defense   analyst Dara Massicot, “Russian units grafted protective armor onto vehicles, learned new styles of camouflage, and adopted small-unit assault tactics, among many other adaptations.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian Defense Ministry also set up an elite drone unit called Rubikon, “which experiments with different types of tactics that now inform how other UAV units are instructed,” Massicot wrote in  Foreign Affairs. \n \n\n   \n  For all its innovation and a surge in domestic production of drones and missiles, Ukraine still needs a constant pipeline of weapons from its allies. Russian barrages of  missiles and drones  – often several hundred in one night – have again underlined its shortfall in air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky renewed calls for Western-made defenses in the wake of a deadly attack overnight on Friday into Saturday, which killed two in capital Kyiv. Ukraine is “paying special attention to the Patriot systems, so that we can protect our cities from this horror,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Russia is moving toward producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type drones each month, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence  told CNN  in September.\n \n\n   \n  That’s just one reason why Ukraine wants longer-range missiles – to take the war to targets such as drone factories deep inside Russia. But US President Donald Trump says that ,  for now ,  providing Tomahawk cruise missiles is off the table.\n \n\n   \n  Kyiv is now pinning its hopes on Europe to beef up its capabilities.   “Everyone who is now helping Ukraine with air defense systems and (the) missiles for them is protecting lives,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “And everyone who helps Ukraine with long-range capabilities will bring the end of the war closer,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said he anticipated “a good and, in many ways, completely new agreement on our defense capabilities” in meetings with European allies this week.\n \n\n   \n  But, with   most weapons production pipelines measured over years rather than month s,  rapid improvisation has an important role on the battlefield.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/adelita-grijalva-arizona-mike-johnson-epstein","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Frustrated Arizonans Wait More Than a Month for New Congresswoman to Be Seated","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After winning a special election on September 23, 2025, Adelita Grijalva, daughter of former Rep.

Raúl Grijalva, until his death in March. When his daughter, Adelita Grijalva,  won a special election  on September 23 to replace him, Wilson expected a seamless handoff.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, more than a month later, the local congressional office in Tucson is shuttered and the phones ring unanswered. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has  refused to swear in  Grijalva, a Democrat, while the  government is shut down , leaving the residents of her sprawling southern Arizona district without a vote in Congress — or help back home.\n \n\n   \n  “Here I am paying taxes to the federal government,” Wilson said from her Tucson office this week, “and not only is it closed but I don’t have a representative either.”\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva spent much of the week in Washington unable to access government email and federal systems. While most congressional offices are buzzing with activity, her suite on the Hill remains mostly quiet and many desks sit empty. She doesn’t have the resources or authority, she said, to staff a district office or assist constituents who try to contact her. Without security privileges, she’s barred from bringing so much as a hammer into the Capitol for hanging pictures. It would be considered a weapon, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I am basically a tourist with an office in DC,” she told CNN this week.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat,  filed a lawsuit  on Tuesday seeking to force Johnson to seat Grijalva. But the Republican leader has remained adamant he won’t administer the oath until the House is back in session — which he said won’t happen until the Senate passes a spending bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m willing and anxious to do that,” he said this week.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, frustration in Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is mounting as residents enter a second month without a voice in the country’s halls of power. At a weekend “No Kings” rally in Tucson opposing President Donald Trump, chants of “Swear her in!” echoed throughout the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re all shocked,” said Ross Sheard, a retired schoolteacher and administrator in Tucson. He and his wife, former principal Susie Cervantes Sheard, voted early for Grijalva, who they knew from her two decades on the local school board, and eagerly awaited her swearing in. They’re still waiting.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a damn shame,” Sheard said.\n \n\n   \n    A massive district without a voice\n \n\n   \n  The lack of representation comes as Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is at the frontlines of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Its boundaries include nearly all of the state’s border with Mexico — hundreds of miles Trump has vowed to close off with a wall. When Republicans stage appearances at the US-Mexico border in Arizona — as Trump and Vice President JD Vance have over the past two years — they’re almost always standing in the 7th District.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a massive district, jutting into parts of the Phoenix suburbs, Tucson and Yuma that are only reachable after hours of driving through cactus-lined two-lane desert roads. It includes a 1.9 million-acre Air Force range, multiple ports of entry and a large veterans’ hospital. It’s home to several Native American reservations and the University of Arizona. One-in-six residents are seniors on Social Security and nearly half are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for lower-income individuals.\n \n\n   \n  Raúl Grijalva represented the district in Congress for more than two decades. Weeks after his death, Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva announced she would seek her late father’s seat. Running on the strength of her family name, she sailed to victory in the Democratic primary this summer and then defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election, capturing 70% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  A vast gulf divided Grijalva and Butierez on most issues, but they both committed to sign onto a bipartisan House effort to release all records related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva would be the decisive 218th member to support a discharge petition and force a House vote on the Epstein files over the objections of Johnson and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Grijalva has asserted the delay is an attempt to block a vote on the Epstein files. Among her supporters, that’s a given.\n \n\n   \n  “If Donald is innocent, then why wouldn’t he want them totally out? Expose everybody, Democrat, Republican, whomever. It’s time,” said Doug Hayden, a homebuilder from Green Valley, Arizona. “Just gotta swear her in and let her do her job that we elected her for.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has denied the saga is related to the push to release the Epstein files, which has support from a handful of Republicans in addition to House Democrats. He claimed he is following a precedent not to swear-in new members during a recess set by his predecessor, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. However, earlier this year, Johnson seated a pair of Florida Republicans less than 24 hours after their special election victories at a time when the House was not in regular session. The move filled two House vacancies and bolstered Johnson’s narrow majority at a critical time.\n \n\n   \n  Butierez, who is planning to challenge Grijalva again next November, said the congresswoman-elect has made the shutdown personal and created an adversarial relationship with Johnson out of the gate that won’t benefit her constituents. He contended her concerns about not getting a paycheck or an email address are minor compared to the problems facing Arizonans after decades of her leadership in local government.\n \n\n   \n  He also suggested that the district is no worse off now than the past two years, when her father missed more than 500 votes while battling cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “Why didn’t anybody care then?” Butierez said.\n \n\n   \n    Government 101\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican voters in the district are unbothered by not having a vote in Congress for the time being and they support Johnson’s reasoning for the delay.\n \n\n   \n  Tucson machine shop owner Jerry Ward dismissed Grijalva’s concerns and he anticipated that as a Republican “we’re not going to have much of a voice” once she is seated.\n \n\n   \n  “But she definitely needs to get her seat, and if she’s patient, it will happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Dangling a fishing line into a community lake in Sahuarita, a union worker named Steve supported Johnson’s position.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s anything like her father, I don’t blame (Johnson),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Steve, who declined to give his last name, accused the elder Grijalva of ignoring the hunters and outdoorsmen in the district. “He didn’t do anything. He was a joke.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s not how Wilson, the immigration attorney, remembers Grijalva’s time in government. Over the years, his office assisted her clients when green cards failed to arrive, citizenship applications faced unexpectedly long delays and other challenges caused by a cumbersome immigration system. She noted the award he received in 2018 from the Congressional Management Foundation for outstanding constituent service.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the level of service we’re accustomed to,” Wilson said.\n \n\n   \n  Some of that work continued even after his passing as his staff kept up constituent services. But his office stopped taking new cases in August and it shut down entirely when Adelita Grijalva won her special election. A Tucson address is still listed as the local point of contact, but notes in English and Spanish taped to the window encouraged residents who come by to instead call one of the state’s two senators.\n \n\n   \n  When Tucson resident Kent Barter cast his ballot for Grijalva, he thought it marked the end of the district’s time without a representative and offices like the one in Tucson would reopen. The former high school government teacher said Republicans in Congress were failing civics.\n \n\n   \n  “Representation is guaranteed by the Constitution, and party politics should be below that,” Barker said. “If you’re voted in, you should have a seat.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/tech/aws-outage-cause","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-04:00","title":"How a Tiny Bug Spiraled into a Massive Outage That Took Down the Internet","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A critical race condition in Amazon Web Services (AWS) caused two automated systems to simultaneously update a shared DNS entry, resulting in an empty record that disrupted core services.

tiny bug spiraled into a massive outage that took down the internet \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  massive AWS outage  Monday that brought down some of the world’s most popular apps and services all started with a glitch.\n \n\n   \n  The bug – which occurred when   two automated systems were trying to update the same data simultaneously – snowballed into something significantly more serious that Amazon’s engineers scrambled to fix, the company said Thursday in a  postmortem assessment .\n \n\n   \n  The  massive cloud service’s outage  meant people couldn’t order food, communicate with hospital networks, access mobile banking, or connect with their security systems and smart home devices. Major global companies, including Netflix, Starbucks and United Airlines, were temporarily unable to give customers access to their online services.\n \n\n   \n  “We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers,” Amazon said in a statement on the AWS website. “We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.”\n \n\n   \n  At a high level, the issue stemmed from two programs competing to write the same DNS entry – essentially a record in the internet’s phonebook – at the same time, which resulted in an empty entry. That threw multiple AWS services into disarray.\n \n\n   \n  “The analogy of a telephone book is pretty apt in that the folks on the other line are there, but if you don’t know how to reach them, then you have a problem,” Angelique Medina, head of Cisco’s ThousandEyes Internet Intelligence network monitoring service, told CNN. “And that telephone book effectively went poof.”\n \n\n   \n  Indranil Gupta, a professor of electrical and computing engineering at the University of Illinois, used a classroom analogy to explain Amazon’s technical analysis in an email to CNN. Say two students, one who is a fast worker, the other who is a slower worker, are asked to collaborate on a shared notebook.\n \n\n   \n  The slower student “pays attention in brief bursts, but their work may conflict or contradict the work of the faster student,” he wrote. At the same time, the quicker student may be “trying to constantly ‘fix’ things quickly” and delete the slower   student’s work because it’s outdated.\n \n\n   \n  “The result… an empty page (or crossed out page) in the lab notebook, when the teacher comes and inspects it,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That “empty page” brought down AWS’ DynamoDB database, creating a cascading effect that impacted other AWS services like EC2, which offers virtual servers for developing and deploying apps, and Network Load Balancer, which manages demands across the network. When DynamoDB came back online, EC2 tried to bring all of its servers back online at once and couldn’t keep up.\n \n\n   \n  Amazon is making a number of changes to its systems following the outage, including fixing the “race condition scenario,” which caused the two systems to overwrite each others’ work in the first place, and adding an additional test suite for its EC2 service.\n \n\n   \n  Outages like Monday’s, while rare, are just a reality, Gupta said. But what matters is how such issues are addressed.\n \n\n   \n  “Large scale outages like this, they just happen. There’s nothing you can do to avoid it, just like (how) people get ill,” Gupta told CNN over the phone. “But I think how the company reacts to the outages and keeps customers informed is really, really key.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/politics/east-wing-demolition-white-house-trump-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"04:30:00-04:30","title":"The East Wing demolition speaks to Trump’s wrecking-ball presidency","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the controversial demolition of the East Wing of the White House by President Donald Trump, who ordered its destruction to build a $300 million, gold-leafed ballroom modeled after his Mar-a-Lago retreat.

The East Wing demolition speaks to Trump’s wrecking-ball presidency \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:30 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Everyone says the same thing the first time they go inside the White House: It’s much smaller than they expected.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the West Wing, the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and the offices of top officials are within steps of one another. The executive mansion, with its great state spaces like the East Room and State Dining Room, is elegant, but intimate. The Cross Hall, leading to the front door on the north front of the building, is imposing but not overwhelming. This is where the haunting picture of a pensive John F. Kennedy hangs, and where President Barack Obama walked down a long red carpet to announce the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011. There’s nothing like the scenes in the TV show “The West Wing” with idealistic young staffers doing the walk-and-talk through endless corridors of busy power players. If you tried to do that in the real West Wing, you’d hit a wall and break your nose.\n \n\n   \n  Most presidents — unlike Donald Trump, who  loaded up the Oval Office with gold trinkets  — stick to traditional dignified furnishings. The place is tasteful but discreet. It hums with quiet intensity. But it’s not brawny. The power here is great, and it enhances itself through understatement. There is no need to boast.\n \n\n   \n  Most visitors to the White House, for a tour or a Christmas party, would enter through the East Wing, a low-slung annex with a white-columned entrance. Guests traversed a corridor between wood panels, with doors leading off to office complexes for the first lady. Walls that soaked up history kept alive the aura of  Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan . This was Eleanor Roosevelt’s domain.\n \n\n   \n  That’s all gone now, turned into dust and rubble in a couple of extraordinary days when  demolition teams ripped apart the East Wing  on the orders of Trump, who is itching to build his  $300 million ballroom  in its place.\n \n\n   \n  There may never have been a better metaphor for a presidency. Trump has spent nine months tearing away at the federal government, the rule of law and democracy. Now he’s turned his  wrecking ball  on the White House itself. All without consulting the citizens who gave him a temporary lease on the place.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, preservationists and historians slammed Trump as a philistine. His spokespeople counter that  many presidents changed the White House . Franklin Roosevelt built the current Oval Office. Harry Truman gutted the entire interior and reconstructed it to stop it from collapsing. But no modern president contemplated Trump’s stark destruction — which followed his paving over of  the iconic Rose Garden  to emulate the terrace at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, complete with yellow sun umbrellas.\n \n\n   \n  So, what about the ballroom? The grand design seems to get bigger every time Trump pulls out his prints of artist’s impressions. Visiting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte looked surprised to get a sneak preview of plans for Trump’s new labor of love rather than maps of war-rattled Europe in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump now envisages a massive edifice of at least 90,000 square feet — almost twice the size of the White House itself, and daubed with his signature gold leaf — that could accommodate huge events and parties. Trump has rightly complained the White House lacks a large venue. He even offered to build one for the Obama administration after seeing marquees on the South Lawn for a foreign leader banquet. But one of the perks of a state dinner invite, in the East Room for instance, is that it’s cozy. Wherever you sit, you’re within a few feet of the president. That’s what makes it special.\n \n\n   \n  Of all the shocking things Trump has done so far in his second term, the bulldozing of the East Wing is the most tangible. Backhoes hacking away at the white plaster are likely to be among the defining images of this turbulent political era. But does the desecration of a not especially distinguished piece of architecture that most Americans will never visit really matter that much when millions are struggling with high grocery prices and rent? Probably not. That’s unless this moment comes to symbolize an increasingly profligate administration with plenty of cash for its pet priorities, like a  $20 billion bailout for Argentina , but that seems oblivious to the cost of living — and dying, given  high health care premiums .\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps Trump will live up to his promises and prove he’s one of America’s great builders, and the new facility will become as beloved as the East Wing in time. But given the  long list of corporate donors , it may end up as a monument to corruption and an administration that supped with oligarchs. (It is not the first White House renovation to be privately funded; President Gerald Ford’s swimming pool, for instance, was  controversial at the time .)\n \n\n   \n  Maybe the president is just misunderstood; maybe he’s being unfairly pilloried for gifting the nation a beautiful new gathering place. But this might also be the latest disconcerting echo of an autocratic-style obsession with grand projects that will tower over citizens when leaders are gone. Trump is also thinking of disrupting the classic Washington skyline  with a huge arch  across the Arlington Memorial Bridge from the Lincoln Memorial to mark America’s 250th birthday next year.\n \n\n   \n  Ironically, the East Wing came tumbling down days after millions of Americans took part in anti-Trump protests last weekend under the banner of “No Kings.” The relative modesty of the White House, compared with the great castles and palazzos of Europe, was a reminder that the United States freed itself from monarchs and doesn’t need its leaders to live in palaces.\n \n\n   \n  Trump seems to disagree.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/ukraine-europes-coalition-of-the-willing-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"04:01:00Z","title":"Ukraine’s future is our future: Europe’s ‘Coalition of the Willing’ vows to increase economic pressure on Russia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"European leaders, including the UK, US, and EU, convened in London to strengthen economic pressure on Russia through expanded sanctions, particularly targeting its oil sector.

so-called “Coalition of the Willing” met in London to discuss strategies to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The leaders called on more countries to implement sanctions against Russian oil companies after US President Donald Trump unveiled a new wave of sanctions targeting Moscow’s two biggest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s measure was followed by the EU rolling out additional sanctions and agreeing to finance Ukraine for the next two years.\n \n\n   \n  Europe faces mounting pressure to settle the protracted conflict as Russian aircraft  incursions  into Europe persist and lethal strikes  damage  Ukraine’s infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Despite overtures from Trump and other world leaders to negotiate a resolution, Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands on Kyiv to bring the war to an end and refused to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that Ukrainian security is interlinked with many other countries, including the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine’s future is our future. What happens in the weeks and months ahead is pivotal for the security of the United Kingdom and all our allies across NATO and beyond,” Starmer said.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the United Kingdom “became the first country to sanction all of Russia’s oil majors,” including the same companies  sanctioned  by the US, Starmer said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Starmer said that the “combined impact” of the US, UK and EU sanctions not only impacts the Russian economy but also demonstrates that countries are “all coordinating clearly in our efforts to support Ukraine and effectively doing so.”\n \n\n   \n  The prime minister urged more countries to sanction more Russian oil companies, “to go further, to reduce their dependencies and incentivize third countries to stop buying these tainted resources.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Trump and Ukraine’s other “partners” who took similar actions, calling the recent oil sanctions a “big step.”\n \n\n   \n  “Diplomacy matters only when it can lead to real decisions. And when it comes to Russia, that dish has many ingredients. The essential ones are real forms of pressure on Russia, sanctions, our long-range capabilities, political pressure, accountability for war crimes, and real actions regarding Russian assets,” the Ukrainian leader said.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has made repeated pleas for US-made  Tomahawk missiles  to enable the Ukrainian army to carry out targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky first  traveled  to Washington, where Trump denied his request. On Thursday, he  urged  the European Council to provide Ukraine with long-range weaponry.\n \n\n   \n  Strikes continued to hammer Ukraine as the leader traveled to London to engage in the coalition talks. At least three people were killed in Russian strikes that targeted residential areas in Kherson on Friday morning, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “Long-range capability directly strengthens democracy,” Zelensky said at the coalition’s press conference on Friday. “The more losses Putin suffers on his own territory, the fewer assaults he can carry out on the front line, and the faster he will agree to meaningful diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte argued that the current moment is the right time to apply more force on Russia, as Putin faces difficulties on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is that Putin is running out of money, troops, and ideas,” Rutte said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now is the right time to increase the pressure on Russia so we can finally get a fair and just peace for Ukraine,” Rutte said.\n \n\n   \n  Coming on the heels of the “good” meeting with Trump in Washington, Rutte commended the American leader’s new  sanctions , which Rutte said would “starve” Russia’s two largest oil companies.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the measures prove that Trump is “absolutely committed to ending this war and bringing a lasting peace to Ukraine.”\n \n\n   \n    Latest diplomatic talks\n \n\n   \n  Trump called off a diplomatic summit with Putin  scheduled  to be held in Budapest after feeling that the Russian leader was not committed to making progress towards a deal.\n \n\n   \n  The two last met at a  high-profile summit  in Alaska over the summer, from which little progress appeared to emerge.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Trump had “not seen enough interest” in “moving the ball forward towards peace” from the Russian side, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Russia’s top economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev,  arrived  in the United States, where he is expected to meet Trump administration officials “to continue discussions about the  US-Russia  relationship,” sources with knowledge of the visit told CNN exclusively on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post on X  later Friday, Dmitriev said that his visit was “planned a while ago based on an invitation from the US side.”\n \n\n   \n  In the coalition meeting, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof remarked that increasing economic pressure on Russia is “the only way to persuade Putin to engage in serious talks.”\n \n\n   \n  The coalition “agreed to be united in our efforts” to counter Russia, Denmark’s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Putin’s strategy has been to wait for us to stop at some point to give up.

days of hurricane conditions as Melissa set to rapidly intensify in the Caribbean \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Mary Gilbert, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:19 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean are staring down what could become a catastrophic, days-long assault of extreme rainfall and damaging winds with a strengthening Tropical Storm Melissa expected to become a major hurricane over some of the hottest ocean water on the planet.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are urging anyone in Melissa’s path to prepare for life-threatening flooding, landslides, power outages and dangerous seas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could be the strongest hurricane ever to hit Jamaica. Its rain has already been pounding parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic for several days, flooding roadways and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced as a result of Melissa’s flooding rain, emergency operations officials said at a Friday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  As of early Saturday, Melissa was about 170 miles southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 70, just shy of hurricane strength, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm is  hardly moving  – drifting at just 3 mph – but is starting to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The Meteorological Service of Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning for the country, according to the NHC. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for southern Haiti, with strong winds set to arrive as soon as Friday night and ramp up over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is expected to become a hurricane by Saturday morning and rapidly intensify into a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The NHC forecasts Melissa to peak at a high-end Category 4 hurricane with 155 mph winds Sunday night and Monday as it churns south of Jamaica, but notes “there is a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane.” Category 5 hurricanes have winds of 157 mph or higher.\n \n\n   \n  This explosive strengthening is  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n    Melissa’s extreme threats\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica and Haiti are expected to feel the worst of Melissa’s wrath in the coming days, but surrounding countries cannot let their guards down.\n \n\n   \n  A foot or more of rain is possible in parts of Jamaica, southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic through early next week.\n \n\n   \n  “Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period of time,” the hurricane center warned of Haiti on Friday. “This is a life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect life and property should be taken.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of the storm’s ferocious winds. The nation of nearly 3 million people will likely face tropical storm-force winds late Friday into Saturday, while hurricane-force winds build over the weekend and last into early next week. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage are all possible, though the timing for the strongest winds is still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, according to  Christopher Tufton , Jamaica’s minister of health. This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, minister of science, energy, telecommunications and transport.\n \n\n   \n  “I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a news conference Friday. “You have been given enough notice that (Melissa) is coming and that it could be disastrous, so take all measures to protect yourself.”\n \n\n   \n  After Melissa roars by Jamaica, Cuba is likely to be the next country in the storm’s path. Eastern Cuba could face destructive winds and flooding rain from Melissa by midweek. The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos could also see impacts later in the week.\n \n\n   \n  The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct hit looks unlikely. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n    Why Melissa’s forecast is so alarming\n \n\n   \n  As this tricky forecast comes into focus, all signs point to Jamaica being ground zero for what could become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/asia/rubio-usaid-cut-children-hungry-rohingya-bangladesh-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Marco Rubio said US aid cuts were to slash bureaucracy.

So why are more refugee children going hungry? \n       \n  By Rebecca Wright, Ivan Watson, Salman Saeed, Su Chay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On the floor of their tiny makeshift home in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, her mother Fatima Begum feeds Sofiya by rubbing her gums with a food paste designed to treat severe malnutrition.\n \n\n   \n  These life-saving packets were provided by the US government, labeled with the logo of USAID – a legacy of the now-defunct organization which was dismantled by the Trump administration in January. With US aid cuts of $8 billion annually, a gaping hole has been left in international aid.\n \n\n   \n  The impact is already being felt in the world’s largest refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, where UNICEF reports an alarming 11% rise in the number of children with acute malnutrition between January and September this year.\n \n\n   \n  The remaining USAID supplies are now running out, and Begum says their regular food donations are also decreasing.\n \n\n   \n  “Before, they gave more food, but now they don’t,” Begum said. “They don’t give fruits like before. They don’t give fish. Still, I’m thankful for whatever they give.”\n \n\n   \n  An ethnic Rohingya Muslim, Fatima Begum fled her home in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state in 2017, after the military carried out what the US and UN experts call a genocide. Now, she is crammed alongside 1.2 million Rohingya in sprawling refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Begum fled one type of hell, only to land in another – now facing a daily battle to keep her baby alive.\n \n\n   \n  Sofiya is currently receiving 2.5 portions of the ready-to-use therapeutic food packets (RUTF) every day, with each one providing 500 calories from the mix of powdered milk, peanuts, vegetable oil and vitamins. Over the past few decades, this simple product has helped to bring millions of children back from the brink of starvation.\n \n\n   \n  As of July this year, UNICEF has had to cut the number of RUTF packets given per child in the camps, to try to stretch resources.\n \n\n   \n  “Cox’s Bazar is ground zero for the impact of budget cuts on people in desperate need,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres after he visited the camps in March, adding that “people will suffer and even people will die.”\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly denied that US aid cutbacks caused any deaths, and has defended the move as a way to cut bureaucracy and prioritize “our national interests.”\n \n\n   \n  But a study published in  The Lancet  predicts the cuts will result in 14 million deaths over the next five years – and an online impact tracking tool run by a Boston University professor estimates that there are already 88 deaths per hour.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, a US State Department spokesperson said the US announced “an additional $60mn in life-saving humanitarian assistance for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh” in September, including emergency food assistance and RUTF packets.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump Administration is significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs and continues to deliver life-saving assistance around the world, including to vulnerable populations like the Rohingya refugees while remaining accountable to the American taxpayer,” the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n    Funding cliff\n \n\n   \n  The children wasting away, day by day, don’t have time to wait for funding gaps to be filled.\n \n\n   \n  At a nutrition center in Camp 15 of Cox’s Bazar – run by Concern Worldwide, with programs from UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) – babies are measured for malnutrition by wrapping a paper tape measure around their tiny arms.\n \n\n   \n  Chronic malnutrition – or stunting – has remained persistently high in the camps, at around 41%, UNICEF says.\n \n\n   \n  “More and more children are being detected with the severest form of malnutrition, and they are at a risk of mortality because of that,” said Deepika Sharma, the Chief of Nutrition and Child Development in Bangladesh for UNICEF.\n \n\n   \n  As international aid is pulled back from the US, along with reductions from other countries including the UK and France, aid agencies have slashed jobs globally to try to protect frontline operations – including nearly 5,000 job losses at the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\n \n\n   \n  But life-saving projects are still being impacted, including medical services, food supplies, and vaccine programs. And the coming year looks worse – with many aid agencies facing a “funding cliff” in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “People are suffering,” said Shamsud Douza, the joint secretary of the Additional Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Office in Cox’s Bazar. “Humanitarian aid decreased, funding is going down, some people are losing jobs, education programs, everything.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Bangladeshi government organized a major conference to try to raise the funds for the Rohingya. And on September 30, the UN held a special conference on the situation in New York.\n \n\n   \n  Refugees in the camps are living on $12 USD of food per person, per month. The World Food Programme said it has not made any ration cuts so far this year, but faces a $126 million funding gap in the next 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  “The needs of the Rohingya in Bangladesh are outpacing resources at an alarming rate,” Julie Bishop, special envoy of the UN secretary-general on Myanmar, said in New York on September 30. “Without new contributions, food assistance for the entire Rohingya community will come to a complete halt in two months.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 150,000 new Rohingya refugees have arrived in the camps in the past two years, UNHCR says, straining the tight resources. They escaped intense fighting between the Myanmar military and the ethnic Rakhine Arakan Army during the civil war – with both sides linked to alleged atrocities against the Rohingya population.\n \n\n   \n  A lot of the new arrivals are already badly malnourished, as aid provision has largely been cut off for their homes in northern Rakhine – where the military has been accused of using hunger as a weapon of war.\n \n\n   \n  Further south in Sittwe – the capital of Rakhine – hundreds of Rohingya have been living in refugee camps since 2012, after previous violent attacks on their community.\n \n\n   \n  Hla Tin, a 39-year-old Rohingya living in a Sittwe camp, told CNN that they haven’t received any aid in the camps since June – suggesting that the situation there is even more dire than in Cox’s Bazar. The humanitarian need inside Myanmar is only 12% funded, according to the UN.\n \n\n   \n  Hla Tin has five children, and the youngest two are both suffering from malnutrition.\n \n\n   \n  “These days due to lack of nutritious food, both elderly people and children get sick more easily,” Hla Tin said.\n \n\n   \n  Among 432 families in the camp, over 300 are not eating regular meals, and people are getting into debt taking loans to buy food, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to call on the international community and organizations to not turn a blind eye to us, but to help us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Back in the bamboo and tarpaulin tents which blanket the hillsides of Cox’s Bazar, refugee Mariam Khatun dresses her three small children and prepares a meal – these daily tasks the only thing keeping her going since the death of her eldest daughter, Estafa.\n \n\n   \n  She was a bright student, so her family sent 7-year-old Estafa to private lessons to learn Arabic – hoping that this would give her a chance to leave the camp one day and find a better future.\n \n\n   \n  But things started to change this year when budgets were slashed.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t afford to educate our children. Access to medicine has decreased compared to before,” Khatun said. “If there is no budget in the future… we will suffer even more.”\n \n\n   \n  In the camps, 48 health facilities, along with 11 primary health care centers, have been directly affected by the US government cuts, aid agencies say.\n \n\n   \n  “We see long queues now in our hospitals, people waiting for treatments,” said Hasina Rahman, the Bangladesh country director for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). “Services have been restricted and are limited now in the camps, and that is creating a massive impact.”\n \n\n   \n  In February, Khatun says Estafa became suddenly ill with stomach pains, so they took her to a camp hospital, and she was then transferred to a bigger facility where she received treatment.\n \n\n   \n  “My child suffered and died in pain,” Khatun said, as tears rolled down her face.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of death was “aspiration pneumonia and encephalitis,” according to a death certificate seen by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The grieving mother blames a lack of medical care for her child’s death – although the medical team which treated her told CNN that there was no link between her death and the funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  But tragedies like these also reflect the vulnerability of this refugee population – with the overall reduction in support causing a cascade effect for those already living on a knife edge of survival.\n \n\n   \n  “This is basically a catastrophe in the making,” Rahman, from the IRC, added.\n \n\n   \n  “Before, we used to get support from America,” Mariam Khatun said. “We want their help again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/americas/aircraft-carrier-uss-gerald-ford-profile-intl-hnk-ml","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00Z","title":"U.S. Navy’s Most Lethal Combat Platform Sent to Caribbean as Trump Administration Presses Venezuela Over Drug Trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Navy is deploying its most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, to the Caribbean as part of increased military pressure on Venezuela over alleged drug trafficking.

platform,’ the carrier USS Gerald R Ford, is being sent to the Caribbean \n       \n  By Brad Lendon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:10 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, billed by the US Navy as “the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world,” is being sent to the Caribbean as the Trump administration ramps up  military pressure on Venezuela  over alleged drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at the Ford and the military assets it will bring to US operations in the region.\n \n\n   \n  With a displacement of more than 100,000 tons and a length of 1,100 feet (334 meters), the Ford is the largest warship the US has ever put to sea.\n \n\n   \n  Commissioned in 2017, it’s the first of its class, the successor to the Navy’s 10 Nimitz-class carriers, the oldest of which will be retired next year.\n \n\n   \n  It carries a crew of almost 4,600, including its air wing. That’s about 20% less personnel than the Nimitz class, which the Navy says is possible because of more efficient systems on the Ford.\n \n\n   \n  Those efficiencies are what make the Ford the most advanced carrier in the world and result from its two nuclear reactors, whose exact specs are classified but that put out three times the electrical power of those on the Nimitz-class ships, according to the Navy.\n \n\n   \n  That extra power enables the Ford to operate the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). Using magnets instead of steam to power the ship’s catapults gives the Ford the ability to launch aircraft faster and with heavier weapons and more fuel, increasing the range and lethality of its fighter jets.\n \n\n   \n  The same science applies to its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, which use electromagnetic motors rather than hydraulics, meaning it can move munitions more quickly from magazines to the flight deck and loaded onto aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  The ship also boasts the Navy’s Advanced Arresting Gear, the system which essentially grabs the tailhook of aircraft with wires when they touch down on its flight deck. The Navy says the digitally controlled system allows for increased sortie rates and lower energy consumption.\n \n\n   \n  The Ford’s flight deck is about four feet wider than the Nimitz class, and its “island” – the portion of the ship rising above the flight deck – is smaller and set farther back, giving more space for easier handling of aircraft movements.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp teeth of the Ford are the F/A-18 fighter jets in carries.\n \n\n   \n  The twin-engine Boeing aircraft can carry a range of air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as laser-guided bombs. They have a maximum combat range of 1,250 miles (2,011 kilometers), according to the Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Ford also carries electronic-jamming aircraft, airborne early warning and control planes, cargo and passenger planes and helicopters.\n \n\n   \n  But the Ford doesn’t carry the Navy’s newest stealth fighter jet, the F-35C. Modifications needed to support the fifth-generation aircraft are not expected to be made until a yet-to-be-determined future maintenance period.\n \n\n   \n  Getting the Ford into fighting shape was a struggle for the Navy. Though it was commissioned in 2017, it didn’t make its  first deployment  until 2022 as the service struggled to work out kinks in its advanced systems.\n \n\n   \n  The ship made its  first combat deployment  in 2023, an eight-month cruise that saw it spend time in the eastern Mediterranean after the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/usda-contingency-fund-november-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00.000Z","title":"Trump Administration Won’t Use Contingency Fund to Pay November Food Stamp Benefits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown beginning on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has declined to use its $6 billion contingency fund to pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November, citing legal limitations.

stamp benefits \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:16 AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture says it will not tap into its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food stamp benefits next month if the shutdown continues, according to an agency memo obtained by CNN. That means that roughly 42 million Americans  will not receive critical food assistance  from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November, unless the agency shifts its position.\n \n\n   \n  However, when asked whether he would direct USDA to fund food stamps next month, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday, “Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep.” The president did not provide specific details.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments appear to conflict with the agency’s memo, which stated that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits,” the memo says. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, states will not be reimbursed if they use their own funds to pay for benefits, according to the memo, which was reported earlier  by Axios .\n \n\n   \n  The loss of the critical safety net program ramps up pressure on Congress to end the federal  government shutdown , which began on October 1, by agreeing to a federal spending package. Democrats have said they will not support a short-term spending bill unless it includes an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers and officials have blamed the Democrats for the impasse, saying they are harming Americans. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week told reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  The agency told states earlier this month that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asked them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  However, Democratic lawmakers and SNAP advocates argue that USDA should – or is even obligated to – use the contingency fund to pay November benefits, which are estimated to cost about $8 billion. And they are urging the agency to tap into other pots of money to cover the difference, as the administration has done for its priorities  like paying troops .\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rollins’ claim that the Trump Administration is unable to deliver November SNAP benefits during a shutdown is unequivocally false,”   Sharon Parrott , president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Office of Management and Budget official, said in a statement Thursday. “In fact, the Administration is legally required to use contingency reserves — billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has been since taken offline, the agency noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue” and referenced that the contingency plan can be used to fund participant benefits if a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through SNAP. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/25/style/miss-usa-winner-announced-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"04:21:00.000-04:00","title":"Miss USA crowns Nebraska’s Audrey Eckert the winner as scandal-hit pageant heralds ‘new era’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Miss USA pageant, embroiled in a scandal following the resignations of Miss USA 2023, Noelia Voigt, and Miss Teen USA, UmaSofia Srivastava, returned in 2025 under new ownership by JKN Global Group, who acquired the rights in 2022.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Audrey Eckert from Nebraska was named Miss USA on Friday, as the  scandal-hit  annual pageant returned under new ownership.\n \n\n   \n  The 22-year-old digital safety advocate beat 50 other contestants to claim the crown at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada. Ivy Harrington from New Jersey and Chantéa McIntyre from Oregon were named first and second runners-up.\n \n\n   \n  The event capped almost 18 months of turbulence for the long-running contest, which underwent an acrimonious change in leadership following the resignation of Miss USA 2023, Utah’s Noelia Voigt, amid allegations of mistreatment.\n \n\n   \n  With the event’s new organizers heralding a “new era,” Friday’s finale concluded five days of events spanning swimwear competitions, eveningwear parades and Q&As with judges.\n \n\n   \n  Eckert, a former cheerleader and graduate of University of Nebraska-Lincoln, fell to her knees when her victory was announced, overcome with emotion in a blizzard of gold streamers.\n \n\n   \n  In a break from tradition, she was crowned by reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjær Theilvig rather than by last year’s winner, Alma Cooper of Michigan, who was not in attendance. Voigt meanwhile made a surprise return to the pageant as a host for the official online broadcast, having co-hosted one of the preliminary competitions on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Ongoing turmoil\n \n\n   \n  The Miss USA pageant was plunged into controversy last May, when Voigt and then-reigning Miss Teen USA, UmaSofia Srivastava, resigned within days of one another. Voigt initially attributed her decision to mental health concerns, but social media users spotted that the first letters of the first 11 sentences of her cryptic post spelled “I am silenced,” sparking rumors of a strict non-disclosure agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Her resignation letter, later seen by CNN, alleged a “toxic work environment” that “at best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.” Voigt also claimed the pageant’s organizers had failed to provide an “effective handler,” resulting in her being sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Florida while alone with an unnamed person in a car. Miss USA’s then president, Laylah Rose, has consistently denied allegations of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, American businessman Thom Brodeur announced he had acquired the rights to Miss USA and Miss Teen USA from the Miss Universe Organization, which controls both licenses. The 10-year deal sees him assume the role of Miss USA’s president and CEO, but Rose – still posting via the pageant’s official Instagram account – rejected this, writing in a since-deleted post that she had not seen “any new contracts regarding any transfer of ownership.”\n \n\n   \n  The Miss Universe Organization later issued a  statement  confirming Brodeur’s acquisition, calling it a “new chapter” in the pageant’s “storied history.” Miss Universe’s co-owner JKN Global Group then filed a lawsuit against Rose’s company VVV Global, alleging the firm had breached its contract and brought the Miss USA brand “into disrepute.” The suit also reiterated Voigt’s earlier claims, while accusing Rose of “mistreating pageant contestants, winners, staff and volunteers.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, emailed to CNN by Rose, VVV Global said it was still “committed to the pageant world” and “eager to obtain a full 12-year license agreement for the … pageants as promised from JKN.” The company has also filed a countersuit denying allegations of wrongdoing, while claiming over $116 million in damages and lost profits.\n \n\n   \n  About a week after JKN’s complaint was filed, Brodeur  wrote  on Instagram that he had “officially regained access” to Miss USA’s social media accounts. The businessman and founder of Brodeur Beauty declined CNN’s request for comment on his vision for the pageant, though he has previously attempted to draw a line under recent events. Speaking to People magazine last month about Voight Voigt and Srivastava’s resignations, he  said : “There was some pretty egregious NDA language that suppressed the voices of those two young women and did not give them the ability to speak about their journey. I want to remove that restriction.”\n \n\n   \n  Founded in 1952, the Miss USA organization has undergone multiple changes in leadership in recent years. Donald Trump owned the pageant, as well as the Miss Universe Organization, from 1996 to 2015, when he sold both to WME-IMG. JKN Global Group, a conglomerate founded by Thai businesswoman Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, acquired both Miss Universe and Miss USA in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Rose’s appointment, former Miss USA Crystle Stewart had operated the American pageant’s license, though she stepped down after becoming embroiled in a scandal that included  claims of favoritism  toward the 2022 winner R’Bonney Gabriel. (Gabriel later went on to win Miss Universe.) Stewart denied allegations that the pageant was rigged, and an internal investigation concluded no rigging took place.\n \n\n   \n    Return to normalcy\n \n\n   \n  This year’s contest began Monday with a “state costume” competition, won by Miss Missouri, Shae Smith. Other preliminary contests and closed-door interviews saw the 51 contestants narrowed down to a top 16, with a further four advancing to the final through a public vote.\n \n\n   \n  During an on-stage Q&A with judges — including 2014’s Miss USA, and star of “The Valley,” Nia Sanchez — contestants fielded questions on topics ranging from representation in the media to the future of artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen of this year’s participants were aged 30 or above, after Miss USA  lifted  longstanding rules in 2024 banning women aged over 28 (as well as married women and mothers) from entering. Among them was 44-year-old Miss Delaware, Tetra Shockley, who became the oldest person ever to compete in the pageant. Miss New Hampshire, MonaLesa Brackett, meanwhile became the first woman to compete wearing a hijab.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s pageant also marked the first time Miss USA has not been televised since it was first broadcast on CBS in 1963. It was instead broadcast via a specialist beauty and pageantry streaming service.\n \n\n   \n  Eckert will now go on to compete at the 74th Miss Universe pageant in Thailand next month. The USA is the most successful country in the contest’s history, with nine American entrants going on to claim the title in its 73-year history.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday night, meanwhile, high school student and aspiring dermatologist Mailyn Marsh, of Missouri, was named this year’s Miss Teen USA, a companion title for contestants aged 14 to 19.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/asia/thailand-queen-sirikit-dies-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:43:00-20:00","title":"Thailand’s Queen Mother Sirikit has died at age 93","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Queen Mother Sirikit Kitiyakara, a central figure in Thailand’s monarchy and a lifelong advocate for rural development and environmental conservation, died at 93.

Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:43 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Thailand’s Queen Mother Sirikit, who supervised royal projects to help the rural poor, preserve traditional craft-making and protect the environment, died on Friday. She was 93.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Household Bureau said she died in a hospital in Bangkok. Since Oct. 17, she had been suffering from a blood infection but despite her medical team’s efforts, her conditions did not improve.\n \n\n   \n  She had been largely absent from public life in recent years due to declining health. Her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej,  died in October 2016 .\n \n\n   \n  Photos released by the palace for her 88th birthday showed her son,  King Maha Vajiralongkorn , and other royals visiting the queen mother at Chulalongkorn Hospital, where she was receiving long-term care.\n \n\n   \n  Although overshadowed by her late husband and her son, Sirikit was beloved and influential in her own right.\n \n\n   \n  Her portrait was displayed in homes, offices and public spaces across Thailand and her August 12 birthday was celebrated as Mother’s Day. Her activities ranged from helping Cambodian refugees to saving some of the country’s once-lush forests from destruction.\n \n\n   \n  Yet as the monarchy’s role in society was increasingly scrutinized during Thailand’s last decades of political turbulence, so too was the queen’s part in it.\n \n\n   \n  Stories circulated of her behind-the-scenes influence during upheaval marked by two military takeovers and several rounds of bloody street protests.\n \n\n   \n  And when she publicly attended the funeral of a protester killed during one clash with police, it for many marked her taking a side in the political schism.\n \n\n   \n  Sirikit Kitiyakara was born into a rich, aristocratic family in Bangkok on Aug. 12, 1932, the year absolute monarchy was replaced by a constitutional system. Both of her parents were related to earlier kings of the current Chakri dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  She attended schools in wartime Bangkok, the target of Allied air raids, and after World War II moved with her diplomat father to France where he served as ambassador.\n \n\n   \n  At 16, she met Thailand’s newly  crowned king  in Paris, where she was studying music and languages.\n \n\n   \n  Their friendship blossomed after Bhumibol suffered a near-fatal car accident and she moved to Switzerland, where he was studying, to help care for him. The king courted her with poetry and composed a waltz titled, “I Dream of You.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair married in 1950, and at a coronation ceremony later the same year both vowed to “reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese (Thai) people.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple had four children: current King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and princesses Ubolratana, Sirindhorn and Chulabhorn.\n \n\n   \n  During their early married life, the Thai royals crisscrossed the world as goodwill ambassadors and forged personal ties with world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But by the early 1970s, the king and queen were devoting most of their energies to Thailand’s domestic problems, including rural poverty, opium addiction in hill tribes and a communist insurgency.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, the couple traveled around the countryside while also officiating at more than 500 royal, religious and state ceremonies.\n \n\n   \n  The queen who was an impeccable dresser and avid shopper also relished climbing hills and entering squalid villages where older women called her “daughter.”\n \n\n   \n  Thousands raised their problems to her, ranging from marital squabbles to serious diseases, and the queen and her assistants took up many personally.\n \n\n   \n  While some in Bangkok gossiped about her involvement in palace intrigues and her lavish lifestyle, her popularity in the countryside endured.\n \n\n   \n  “Misunderstandings arise between people in rural areas and the rich, so-called civilized people in Bangkok.\n \n\n   \n  People in rural Thailand say they are neglected, and we try to fill that gap by staying with them in remote areas,” she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1979.\n \n\n   \n  Royal development projects were set up across Thailand, some of them initiated and directly supervised by the queen.\n \n\n   \n  To increase income of poor rural families and preserve dying crafts, the queen in 1976 launched SUPPORT, a foundation which has trained thousands of villagers in silk-weaving, jewelry-making, painting, ceramics and other traditional crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes dubbed the “Green Queen,” she also set up wildlife breeding centers, “open zoos,” and hatcheries to save endangered sea turtles.\n \n\n   \n  Her Forest Loves Water and Little House in the Forest projects sought to demonstrate the economic gains of preserving forest cover and water sources.\n \n\n   \n  While royalty elsewhere had only ceremonial or symbolic roles, Queen Sirikit believed the monarchy was a vital institution in Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some in the universities who think the monarchy is obsolete. But I think Thailand needs an understanding monarch,” she said in the 1979 interview. “At the call, ‘The king is coming,’ thousands will gather.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere word king has something magic in it. It is wonderful.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/dahbia-benkired-sentencing-murder-france-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:51:00-04:00","title":"Woman in France sentenced to life in prison for rape, torture and murder of 12-year-old girl in Paris","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 27-year-old Algerian woman, Dahbia Benkired, was sentenced to life in prison without parole in Paris for the rape, torture, and murder of 12-year-old girl Lola Daviet in October 2022.

October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Every day of the federal government shutdown air traffic controllers calling out sick have caused flight delays, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s different every day,” he told reporters at a news conference at Philadelphia International Airport. “The average… is about 5% of our delays come from staffing shortages with air traffic controllers. We’ve gone up as high as 53% of the delays… because of staffing shortages.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, 12 air traffic control facilities were short-staffed, including the control towers in Dallas Fort Worth, Newark and Phoenix, TRACONs which handle flights approaching and departing Houston, Newark, Southern California as well as centers, which handle high altitude flights around Albuquerque, Atlanta, Denver and New York.\n \n\n   \n  There have been 222 staffing shortages reported since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number reported on the same dates last year. Air traffic controllers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, are required to work during the government shutdown but are not being paid.\n \n\n   \n  “Their paycheck is going to be a big fat zero,” Duffy said. “There’s great frustration. There’s anxiety because as any one of you, you look at the expectation that a paycheck comes in and then you plan for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Controllers, approximately 10,800 federal workers, will receive the first $0 paycheck on October 28. On October 14, they received a partial paycheck, about 90% of the normal total, for hours worked before the shutdown started.\n \n\n   \n  The lapse in government funding makes air travel “less safe,” according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union which represents controllers.\n \n\n   \n  “As this shutdown continues and air traffic controllers are not paid for the vital work that they do… that leads to an unnecessary distraction, and they cannot be 100% focused on their jobs, which makes this system less safe,” he said. “Every day that this shutdown continues, tomorrow, we’ll be less safe than today.”\n \n\n   \n  Duffy noted the FAA will slow planes down or cancel flights if they cannot be operated safely.\n \n\n   \n  “If we don’t have enough controllers, if we have controllers that are more stressed and less able to do the job… we will reduce the capacity of airplanes taking off and landing, or we will cancel flights,” Duffy said.  “I’m less concerned about you getting there on time. I want you to be safe.”\n \n\n   \n  This week, staffing shortages were also reported in control towers in Austin, Chicago-O’Hare, Nashville, Newark and Reagan National airport, as well as FAA centers in Albuquerque, Cleveland, Denver, Fort Worth, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Jacksonville, New York and Washington, DC. The facilities in Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Houston that handle flights approaching or departing the area were also short-staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy also warned while future air traffic controllers studying at the FAA academy will be paid for the next couple of weeks, the money will run out soon which would be “cataclysmic” for them.\n \n\n   \n  “Controllers in the academy, and some who have been given spots in the next class of the academy are bailing. They’re walking away,” he said. “They’re asking themselves why do I want to go into a profession where I could work hard and have the potential of not being paid for my services.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation needs about 3,000 more air traffic controllers, and the increased enrollment at the academy is part of the agency’s effort to “supercharge” hiring.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/zohran-mamdani-islam-cuomo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"19:14:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani Defends His Islamic Faith and Slams Cuomo in a Tearful Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, delivered a tearful speech defending his Muslim faith and addressing anti-Muslim prejudice, particularly in the aftermath of 9/11.

24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, stood outside a mosque Friday and slammed independent candidate Andrew Cuomo for  laughing at the suggestion  Mamdani would cheer a terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  “I will not change who I am, how I eat or the faith that I am proud to call my own,” said Mamdani, who is vying to become the city’s first Muslim mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by a crowd that included women wearing hijabs, Mamdani teared up as he talked about family members facing anti-Muslim prejudice growing up in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to speak to the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after September 11 because she did not feel safe in a hijab,” Mamdani said, adding: “I want to speak to the Muslim who works for our city, whether they teach in our schools, or walk the beat for the NYPD.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo in recent days has trained a spotlight on Mamdani’s faith and immigrant upbringing, trying to undercut Mamdani with people concerned about his criticisms of Israel and whether he would fight antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  During an interview Thursday with radio host Sid Rosenberg, Cuomo said, “God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?”\n \n\n   \n  “He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg responded.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo paused and laughed, adding, “That’s another problem.”\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after Mamdani’s speech, Cuomo held his own event with South Asian supporters in Jackson Heights, Queens, where he accused Mamdani of being an “actor.”\n \n\n   \n  “Today he is playing the victim, but in reality, he is the offender,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  He distanced himself from Thursday’s interaction with Rosenberg: “I can see where if you took it seriously, it was offensive.”\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t take the remark seriously at the time, and of course I think it’s an offensive comment, period, but it did not come out of my mouth,” Cuomo added. “That is my point.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Cuomo accused Mamdani of stoking tensions by espousing antisemitic rhetoric and falsely claiming Mamdani’s campaign had been entirely focused on Israel and Gaza. That’s a notable shift for the former governor, who has repeatedly accused Mamdani of disrespecting Jewish voters with his criticisms of Israel and once served as a lawyer for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “What does Gaza and Israel have to do with running for mayor of the city of New York?” Cuomo said. “Is the mayor a member of the United Nations? Is he part of a negotiating team? Why? Because he wanted to use it for political purposes to divide New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Also this week, Cuomo’s campaign released an unfinished version of an advertisement, created with artificial intelligence, mocking a 2023 interview with Mamdani in which he eats rice with his hands and talks about Palestinian rights, and featuring images of criminals with a keffiyeh and a Palestinian flag.\n \n\n   \n  A Cuomo spokesperson said the video was inadvertently posted and deleted after five minutes.\n \n\n   \n  The back-and-forth comes on the heels of the final general election debate earlier this week, during which Mamdani and Cuomo traded in-person accusations of antisemitism and bigotry.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the savior of the Jewish people? You won’t denounce ‘globalize the intifada,’ which means ‘Kill Jews,’” Cuomo said, referencing the controversial phrase that  Mamdani has discouraged using  and noting that hundreds of rabbis had signed a letter criticizing him. “There’s unprecedented fear in New York.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Friday also criticized Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa for  suggesting during Wednesday’s debate  that Mamdani had praised “global jihad” – which Mamdani denies doing – and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who has endorsed Cuomo, for appearing to suggest on Thursday that Mamdani’s election would usher in Islamic extremism to New York.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not want to use this moment to speak to them any further,” Mamdani said. “I want to use this moment to speak to the Muslims of New York City.”\n \n\n   \n  The setting of Mamdani’s speech was quintessentially New York, outside on a Bronx street with the sound of sirens and airplanes in the background as well as a dog that barked through parts of Mamdani’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The owner of the dog was a local resident who gave his first name as Robert. He said he was a Cuomo supporter.\n \n\n   \n  “At least my dog is saying what people are saying,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani then went inside the mosque to address congregants. In remarks that could be heard on a loudspeaker outside, he asked members of the audience to raise their hands if their names had ever been mispronounced. He described the final days before the November 4 election as “our last opportunity to show ourselves … our dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  As dozens of men left the service, several stopped at a Mamdani campaign table to register to vote.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/mlb-game-1-world-series-blue-jays-dodgers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000Z","title":"Blue Jays power past Dodgers with monster 6th inning to take Game 1 of the World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in Game 1 of the 2025 World Series, ending a 32-year drought for Toronto in World Series appearances.

AM EDT, Sat October 25, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been 32 years since  Toronto  experienced the thrills of the World Series. And on Friday, the city felt those same shockwaves after the Blue Jays came back to take Game 1 over the Los Angeles Dodgers with a final score of 11-4.\n \n\n   \n  The Jays found themselves in a 2-0 hole heading into the bottom of the fourth inning, as the Dodgers looked well on their way to their fourth straight series-opening win this postseason.\n \n\n   \n  But with one Dalton Varsho swing, Toronto found themselves tied with the Dodgers, and the rest was history.\n \n\n   \n  A nine-run onslaught in the bottom of the sixth inning made the difference for Toronto in front of their home fans at a loud and energized Rogers Centre.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Jays utility player Ernie Clement atoned for an early base running mistake with a go-ahead RBI single in the sixth inning to get the scoring started.\n \n\n   \n  The Jays tacked on two more runs before Addison Barger hit a pinch-hit grand slam to break the game wide open. Catcher Alejandro Kirk added a cherry-on-top with a two-run home run for added insurance to make it 11-2.\n \n\n   \n  Barger’s blast was the first ever pinch hit grand slam in World Series history, according to the Fox broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Coming off of a Game 4 performance in the NLCS which still has  baseball fans marveling , Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani connected on a two-run home run in the next half inning to cut into the Jays’ big lead.\n \n\n   \n  But that was as close as the Dodgers would come the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n  Following the lopsided victory in the series opener, the Blue Jays find themselves on the right side of Major League Baseball history.\n \n\n   \n  The winner of Game 1 has gone on to win 23 of the last 27 Fall Classics, dating back to 1997, according to the MLB.\n \n\n   \n  The loss was an unfamiliar feeling for the Dodgers, who had only dropped one game this entire postseason entering Friday.\n \n\n   \n  While the four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers gave the Dodgers some extra rest before their trek up to Canada to start the series, a quick league championship series hasn’t always favored the winner.\n \n\n   \n  The team that swept the LCS is 0-5 against the team that won their respective series in seven games, like the Blue Jays did over the Seattle Mariners, according to the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles starter Blake Snell came out the gates strong but stumbled in the sixth inning, exiting the game after allowing five earned runs while walking three batters and striking out four.\n \n\n   \n  Trey Yesavage, the rookie starter for the Blue Jays, looked like he belonged on the sport’s biggest stage, going four innings, striking out five batters along the way.\n \n\n   \n  Eric Lauer closed out the game for Toronto, getting Dodgers star Mookie Betts to strike out.\n \n\n   \n  The 25-year-old Barger told the Fox crew that he doesn’t remember hitting the grand slam.\n \n\n   \n  “It was so hard to kind of gather my thoughts and everything,” Barger said. “It was just a blackout moment. Crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays won back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993 and despite the long drought, the team has a “tight, energetic” clubhouse, according to Barger.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day we’re having fun in there,” Barger said. “We aren’t taking it too serious. We understand we are playing the Dodgers and they are a great team, but we are trying to keep everything the same and go out and compete like we have all year.”\n \n\n   \n  Barger was quick to praise the Blue Jays fans for their support.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the best fans in baseball,” Barger said. “Obviously a whole country behind us. We feel the energy every single night. They’re awesome. We see them on the streets. … I couldn’t be more happy to be here.”\n \n\n   \n  Game 2 is scheduled for Saturday at 8 p.m. ET in Toronto.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/doj-monitor-polling-sites-california-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00-04:00","title":"Justice Department to monitor polling sites in six counties in California and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has announced federal monitoring of polling sites in six counties—Passaic County in New Jersey and Kern, Riverside, Fresno, Orange, and Los Angeles in California—just days before the November 4 elections.

Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department  announced  Friday it will monitor polling sites in six counties in California and New Jersey ahead of  November 4 elections , as voters prepare to cast their ballots in less than two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The department said the move, which focuses on two Democratic-led states, will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.”\n \n\n   \n  “Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The practice of sending federal election monitors to local jurisdictions dates back decades, though President Donald Trump has tried to  assert new authority  over elections.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s move comes after the Republican parties of California and New Jersey both sent letters to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division requesting monitors in certain counties and alleging election irregularities.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years after the 2020 election, the debunked conspiracy that Trump was robbed of the election due to massive voter fraud is still embraced by many in the Republican Party.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department officials will now be sent to Passaic County in New Jersey and the following counties in California: Kern, Riverside, Fresno, Orange and Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to these counties’ election departments for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said in a statement, “The presence of election observers is not unusual and is a standard practice across the country.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal election monitors, like all election observers, are welcome to view election activities at designated locations to confirm transparency and integrity in the election process,” Logan added. “California has very clear laws and guidelines that support observation and prohibit election interference.”\n \n\n   \n  Fresno County Clerk James Kus told CNN the Justice Department “has not contacted” him about the monitoring.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fresno County Clerk/Registrar of Voters welcomes all observers for our elections,” Kus added. “It is common for us to have local, state, federal, and sometimes international observers, watching how we administer elections that are accessible, accurate, secure, and transparent.”\n \n\n   \n  Enedina Chhim, community outreach manager for the Orange County Registrar of Voters, told CNN that the department was notified by the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California that two attorneys from that office will be observing elections in the county from November 4 to 7.\n \n\n   \n  “Orange County elections are always transparent,” Chhim added.\n \n\n   \n  Since the president’s return to office, the Trump administration has taken several steps to assert a larger federal role in elections ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department is demanding that  states hand over information  about their voters – including sensitive personal data, such as partial Social Security numbers – as they hunt for examples of fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also sought to require voters to show proof of citizenship to vote, attempting an end-run around states and Congress. He  recently pledged  to act unilaterally to impose voter identification requirements on states and to end most mail-in voting, which would upend a safe and reliable voting method used by millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  The president also  signed an executive order  earlier this year, seeking broad changes in how elections are run, although the Constitution primarily vests states with that power. Parts of the order have been blocked in court.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marshall Cohen and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/us-sanctions-colombia-petro-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:51:00Z","title":"US sanctions Colombian President Gustavo Petro","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, son Nicholas, and Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, accusing Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade and citing a spike in cocaine production since his presidency.

the department’s “general gift acceptance authority.”\n \n\n   \n  The move marks a striking departure from government procedure for funding the military, which traditionally relies on public funds

He declined to identify the donor, saying “he doesn’t really want the recognition.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to questions about the donor’s identity and whether they have any ties to foreign entities or interests, a White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Pentagon and Treasury. The Pentagon then referred those questions back to the White House.

strongman leader as Trump-Putin summit scrapped and US sanctions Russia \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:01 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was delighted to learn last week that Russia and the United States had chosen his country as the venue for another  summit  on ending the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Having positioned Hungary – a European Union and NATO member – as an ally of both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, Orbán was hoping to show the world that “the road to peace runs through Budapest.”\n \n\n   \n  But his hopes were dashed after the Trump administration abruptly shelved plans for the Budapest summit and on Wednesday unveiled  sanctions  on Russia’s two biggest oil producers – the first since Trump returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Although the sanctions aim to  deplete Russia’s war chest , they could also wreak havoc on Hungary’s economy. Whereas almost all EU countries have diversified their energy mix away from Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hungary’s dependence has deepened. Along with Slovakia, its fellow antiliberal Central European neighbor, Hungary is almost totally reliant on Russia for its oil imports.\n \n\n   \n  Orbán is now reckoning with the grim consequences of his own energy policy. Alongside Washington’s oil sanctions, the EU on Thursday confirmed it would ban Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from 2027. Last month, Orbán told Trump that, without Russian energy imports, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  Against what he decries as the bland uniformity of Brussels, Orbán says he stands for “sovereignty” – Hungary’s right to chart its own course within the EU and forge ties with hardline leaders abroad. But Orbán’s quest for sovereignty – spurning EU efforts to diversify its energy supplies – has left his country perilously dependent on one country for fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  The double blow of US oil sanctions and the LNG ban comes as Orbán, Europe’s longest-serving prime minister, is struggling to contain Hungary’s surging opposition movement led by Peter Magyar, a former Orbán loyalist-turned-arch-rival. While Orbán had hoped a Trump-Putin summit could shore up his support at home, he now faces a deepening economic crisis that could weaken his hand before a crucial election in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, EU countries moved to slash Russian energy imports to cut off a major source of the Kremlin’s revenue. However, Brussels gave Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic an exemption from a ban on Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary increased its Russian crude oil reliance from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a  report  from the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).\n \n\n   \n  By May, Hungary and Slovakia’s crude oil purchases had sent the Kremlin 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), the report found, saying this was “the equivalent of the cost of purchasing 1,800 Iskander-M missiles that have been used to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  The crude oil imports flow through the  Druzhba pipeline , which has been repeatedly attacked this summer by Ukrainian drones, in an effort by Kyiv to punish its neighbors for helping to fund Moscow’s war.\n \n\n   \n  The CSD-CREA report said that Hungary could diversify its energy supplies, receiving non-Russian oil through Croatia’s Adria pipeline rather than Druzhba.\n \n\n   \n  But Orbán has shown no sign of changing tack. In an interview with Hungarian state radio Friday, he said his government was “working on how to circumvent” the US sanctions, without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Hungary’s intent to find workarounds to the US sanctions could provide the first major test of the Trump administration’s seriousness about enforcing them, said Elina Ribakova, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Despite harsh rhetoric towards Russia from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the decision to impose new sanctions on Russia was due to “Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war” in Ukraine, Trump has been less abrasive, saying he hoped the sanctions “won’t be on for long.” The US president also left the door open to the Budapest summit, saying “we’ll do it in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  The success of the sanctions on Russia’s oil majors will depend on how they are enforced, including against a Trump ally like Orbán, Ribakova told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Which will it be: A friendly Putin-Trump meeting in Hungary, or throwing Hungary’s administration under the bus if they try to evade sanctions?” she said. “I have no idea which way the cards will fall here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/mafia-la-cosa-nostra-nba-sports-gambling-probe","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-17:00","title":"Barcoded decks, contact lenses and X-ray tables: How New York’s mafia allegedly ran illegal poker games tied to US athletes","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A nationwide criminal scheme linked to New York’s mafia families, including the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese crime families, allegedly operated rigged illegal poker games using advanced technologies such as X-ray tables, barcode-embedded contact lenses, and shuffling machines that transmitted card information to off-site operators.

contact lenses and X-ray tables: How New York’s mafia allegedly ran illegal poker games tied to US athletes \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:49 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  You can picture the scene. Tucked somewhere between the glitter and grit of Manhattan, a room wafting smoke with the rhythm of a poker game seemingly like any other: Cards whisper against felt, chips click in steady tempo, and players sit around a table, guarding their hands – and secrets.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the players lured to the table – seduced by celebrity faces and the illusion of fair play – are unaware they have just taken a seat at a game rigged by some members of  New York’s mafia  – La Cosa Nostra, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  That illusion was shattered Thursday when gambling and sports rigging schemes linked to the mob led to the  arrests  of 31 defendants, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA player with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, Damon Jones. The pair, along with others, are “alleged to have participated in a nationwide scheme to rig illegal poker games,” according to US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators described the yearslong probe – dubbed Operation Royal Flush – as a meticulous, evidence-driven effort that exposed a sprawling web of corruption stretching from organized crime to professional sports.\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of each underground poker game was a carefully choreographed ballet of stars, signals and souped-up technology, details outlined by prosecutors show.\n \n\n   \n  “What the victims – the fish – didn’t know is that everybody else at the poker game, from the dealer to the players, including the face cards, were in on the scam,” Nocella said.\n \n\n   \n  Among the  defendants in the gambling scheme  are members of major American crime families, as well as current and former NBA players and coaches, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was implicated in a second indictment alleging he used nonpublic information about upcoming NBA games to allow others to profit on betting.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight,” Trusty added,\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Billups denied the allegations. CNN has reached out to Jones’ representatives but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  More than $7 million was stolen from victims at the underground card games where behind the scenes, an elaborate scheme of advanced technology was tipping the scales, court documents said.\n \n\n   \n  “But my message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this, your winning streak has ended,” Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.”\n \n\n   \n  This specific quiet theater of greed, luck, and deceit is likely over.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how officials say they got away with it for so long.\n \n\n   \n    The poker table\n \n\n   \n  From start to finish, prosecutors say the defendants employed a host of technologically sophisticated tactics to make sure they came out on top, stripping millions from their victims.\n \n\n   \n  Unbeknownst to the targets, they were seated at a poker table fitted with X-ray technology designed to read cards placed face down on the table. The games were monitored by “hidden cameras built into tables and light fixtures,” Tisch said.\n \n\n   \n  Sal Piacente, President of UniverSal Game Protection Development, Inc., an expert in various ways to cheat and who consults with casinos around the world told CNN X-ray systems use cameras embedded in the table, which looked upward through the felt. When cards were precisely positioned, the cameras could identify each card and transmit that information to the shuffle machines.\n \n\n   \n  The shuffling machines appeared to be randomizing the cards. In reality, they were altered to read the deck and predict who got the best hand, according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  An unaltered shuffle machine contains cameras that alert the casino, dealer, or house if a card is missing and ensures the deck is correctly sorted, according to Piacente.\n \n\n   \n  “The cheaters came up with ways of utilizing that camera as well to know what cards are being dealt and who’s getting them, and that shuffle machine is altered to transmit to an earpiece to tell the people who were going to win,” Piacente said.\n \n\n   \n  During the rigged games, information about the player with the best hand was transmitted to an off-site operator who relayed the information to a person seated at the table who was in on the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  That player, known as the “Quarterback” or “Driver” would then signal to other members of the team by touching a certain colored chip or tapping their chin, wrist or arm a detention letter written to the judge said. A signal was assigned to each one of the players who were in on the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Some cards had markers, or barcodes, visible only to individuals wearing “special contact lenses or eyeglasses,” the indictment said. Officials said the defendants also used electronic poker chip trays to analyze and read cards on the table.\n \n\n   \n    The players\n \n\n   \n  The case concerning Billups, a Basketball Hall of Famer, who was a five-time All-Star and 2004 NBA champion, involved high-stakes poker games investigators alleged were rigged.\n \n\n   \n  Billups participated in illegal poker games that took place in Manhattan, Miami, Las Vegas and the Hamptons, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  “Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others,” Billups’ attorney, Chris Heywood, said in a statement. “To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.”\n \n\n   \n  Billups and Jones were dubbed “Face Cards,” professional athletes whose mere presence in the illegal and rigged games offered star power meant to legitimize the games to “attract victims to the games.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the defendants mentioned in the indictment observed one victim seemed eager to give Billups his money because he was “starstruck.” This reaction was intentional. Former professional athletes were used to help lure wealthy victims into the games, according to court documents.\n \n\n   \n  “Once the game was underway, the defendants fleeced the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game,” Nocella said. “The defendants used a variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies, some of which were provided by other defendants in exchange for a share of the profits from the scheme.”\n \n\n   \n  Members of the conspiracy often texted in real time about the scheme, at times coordinating deliberate losses to keep the victim playing longer or to avoid arousing suspicion, court documents said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA said Billups and Rozier are on immediate leave from their teams in the league’s first statement since the news of their arrests.\n \n\n   \n  “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today,” the league said in a statement on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    The consequences\n \n\n   \n  Members of the illicit poker scheme at times threatened and resorted to violence when victims failed to pay their debts on time, prosecutors alleged.\n \n\n   \n  “Watch what’s good now,” defendant Zhen Hu, identified as one of the game organizers in the indictment, allegedly texted one victim in 2022 who had not yet paid a gambling debt. “You’ve been running your mouth unchecked.”\n \n\n   \n  Hu allegedly punched the unnamed victim in the face, a move prosecutors say he confirmed in a message to an associate, “I punched somebody in the face the other day, s**ts unraveling quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors also alleged Hu and three other individuals approached the unnamed victim again sometime later, and the victim was again attacked.\n \n\n   \n  “What you did was cowardly and ridiculous,” the victim texted Hu nearly a year later, according to prosecutors. “And then u send a bunch of goons to solve your problems.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the defendants and their coconspirators also committed acts of violence, Nocella said, “including the gunpoint robbery of a person in order to obtain a rigged shuffling machine and extortions that were perpetrated against victims in order to ensure they repaid their gambling debts.”\n \n\n   \n  Hu is detained in New York pending trial on charges of a crime of violence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. CNN has not been able to determine whether Hu has legal representation.\n \n\n   \n    The Mafia\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, five major Italian American mafia families have  long dominated  organized crime. Four of those five families are involved in the schemes, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Thirteen members and associates of those families are among the defendants in the two cases, according to Christopher Raia, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office. Raia said an illegal gambling operation created a “financial pipeline” for La Cosa Nostra.\n \n\n   \n  In New York, the four families supported the rigged poker games and collected a share of their profits, according to the indictment. One of these games, held primarily in a nondescript building in Manhattan’s Kips Bay neighborhood, was affiliated with the Bonanno family, while another, based mainly in Greenwich Village, was connected to the Gambino family, the indictment says.\n \n\n   \n  “These operatives included capos and multiple soldiers from the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese crime families, bringing four of the five families together in a single indictment is extraordinarily rare,” Tisch said. “It reflects how deep and how far this investigation reached, and the skill and the persistence it took to get here. That work uncovered a deliberate, technologically sophisticated operation designed to carry out their crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  While the Mafia no longer wields the national influence it once did, the FBI warns it  remains a significant threat  in the New York metropolitan area, as well as in New England, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elise Hammond contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/noboa-ecuador-poison-chocolate-jam-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"Ecuador’s President Claims Poisoned Chocolate and Jam Used in New Attempt on His Life","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has survived multiple alleged assassination attempts, including one involving poisoned chocolate and jam containing high levels of toxic chemicals.

Ecuador’s president claims poisoned chocolate and jam used in new attempt on his life \n       \n  Analysis by Max Saltman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:50 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa has had quite a month, surviving not one, not two, but three alleged assassination attempts – the latest of which apparently involved gifts of jam and chocolate laced with poisonous chemicals.\n \n\n   \n  The president made the claim to CNN’s Fernando del Rincon on Thursday, saying the gifts had contained “very high concentrations” of three chemicals, “and it was practically impossible for these to be present together at those levels” – unless the gifts had been spiked.\n \n\n   \n  That comes just weeks after another alleged assassination attempt when a crowd throwing rocks surrounded Noboa’s car as he traveled to an engagement in Cañar province. Bullet marks were later found on the vehicle, according to energy minister Ines Manzano, while days earlier, according to Noboa, another crowd threw Molotov cocktails and homemade rockets at his vehicle . \n \n\n   \n  While some critics are skeptical of the claims amid a lack of publicly available evidence – suggesting instead that they are meant to distract from growing public discontent and protests against Noboa’s government – the president insisted to CNN the threat was real.\n \n\n   \n  “It wasn’t just sticks and stones. There were homemade rockets, Molotov cocktails, projectiles that could still kill you … and from high above, they threw rocks at the windshield and hood of the car,” Noboa said.\n \n\n   \n  “If one of these homemade rockets hits you in the chest or head it would kill you.”\n \n\n   \n  What isn’t in dispute is this: the Ecuadorian president is not short of enemies.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa, the 37-year-old heir to a banana empire and one of Ecuador’s largest fortunes, won his first full term in office this year on a promise to crush the “narcoterrorists” who turned his country from a beacon of peace to the home of Latin America’s highest homicide rates.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has leaned into the strongman approach and tough-on-crime agenda that made him so popular with voters in his first term, bringing him into the sights of powerful criminal groups.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not just those criminal networks who have turned against Noboa. With homicide rates rising once again and growing discontent over economic issues such as the price of diesel, Noboa is seeing his once remarkable approval ratings take a battering. In February 2024, 81% of Ecuadorians approved of him, according to  local polling firm Cedatos.  That figure has since declined to around 50%.\n \n\n   \n  In Ecuador, where presidents tend to be “very, very unpopular,” according to Laura Lizarazo, lead Ecuador analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, that’s still a considerable level of support, but Noboa is facing increasing resistance from indigenous groups and civil society advocates over his unilateral decisions and attempts to strengthen his executive authority.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly unpopular, especially among rural, Indigenous Ecuadorans, has been his canceling of a diesel subsidy – a move that has sparked widespread demonstrations – though he has also come under fire for  subsuming  Ecuador’s environmental watchdog into the ministry of mining, which critics fear will undermine regulation, and for his attacks on the judiciary when it ruled against several security measures, including  blanket immunity for law enforcement .\n \n\n   \n  “He has taken some very polarizing policy decisions that have not been well received by the public, and one example of that is precisely this latest wave of protests (over the diesel subsidies),” Lizarazo said.\n \n\n   \n  During the protests, Noboa declared states of emergency in numerous provinces. The movement subsided after Noboa threatened to send in the military to break protesters’ roadblocks. The president later agreed to lower the price of diesel in two installments in December and February. \n \n\n   \n    A violent turn\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, there are even signs of strain regarding the ‘tough on crime’ message that once made Noboa so popular.\n \n\n   \n  Recently, violence in Ecuador has taken a dramatic turn. After a brief respite last year, homicides  rose 40%  in the first seven months of 2025,  while last week explosions from car bombs rocked Guayaquil and killed one person. And in September, there were  two back-to-back prison massacres. \n \n\n   \n  All this comes despite Noboa’s high-profile deployment of army units into Ecuador’s prisons and city streets, as well as the capture of its most-wanted criminal over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN, Noboa acknowledged the worsening homicide statistics, but pushed back by claiming that a greater percentage of the killings involved criminal-on-criminal violence.\n \n\n   \n  “The numbers are similar to 2023,” Noboa said, “The difference is that in 2023, six out of 10 (of those killed) had a criminal record. Today, nine out of 10 deaths have a criminal record. They are killing each other.”\n \n\n   \n  Some critics question whether Noboa’s hardline approach is making matters worse.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa “thinks that using the army is the best solution to counter drugs,” said John Paul Pinto, a political analyst based in Quito, Ecuador. “And what we’re seeing here in Ecuador is that that’s a bad strategy. It’s a very bad strategy. It’s not working.”\n \n\n   \n  “Security is not only about the army, police, intelligence,” Pinto said. “Security is about (solving) economic problems, social problems, the participation of the private sector.”\n \n\n   \n    Relations with Trump\n \n\n   \n  Also controversial has been Noboa’s plan to revise Ecuador’s constitution to allow foreign militaries to occupy bases in Ecuador – a plan that will be subject to a referendum next month.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa appears so confident that voters will agree with him that his administration has even  drawn up plans  for a US Navy base on Ecuador’s coast.\n \n\n   \n  In the meantime, he has openly courted US President Donald Trump, spontaneously praising him on social media this week to declare that “Ecuador stands firm in the global fight against drug trafficking” – even as other countries in the region voice concern over US strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  Noboa told CNN he supports the fight against drug trafficking, “which affects the entire society,” and said Ecuador had already submitted a formal request to conduct joint operations with US forces.\n \n\n   \n  Lizarazo said the recent wave of violence in Ecuador was not likely to change Noboa’s hardline approach – rather, he would double down.\n \n\n   \n  “For Noboa’s administration, those events are not a signal of a failed security strategy, but rather an argument for advancing more aggressive measures against organized criminal groups,” Lizarazo said. “That is key to the government’s identity, that security discourse and that strongman image and those hardline policies.”\n \n\n   \n     An image of power \n \n\n   \n  Noboa’s image has long been key to his power, analysts say. He’s young, social media-savvy and eager to participate in the politics of spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s kind of an atypical leader for Ecuador,” Lizarazo said, “whose popularity and governing strategy is based on his image, his discourse, rather than a clear, evidence-based, comprehensive state strategy to address the key issues of the several crises the country is facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Pinto pointed to Noboa’s  fight with the country’s constitutional court  over security measures earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  After the court suspended several of Noboa’s security policies, including immunity for law enforcement, Noboa personally led a march through the streets of Quito. Along the parade route, billboards showed pictures of the justices, their faces framed by a red-letter message saying: “These are the judges stealing our peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are not going to permit change to be halted because of nine people who don’t even show their face,” Noboa told demonstrators in a speech the next day.\n \n\n   \n  Critics warned the move could put the justices in danger, but it is hardly the only time he has shown a willingness to flout institutional norms.\n \n\n   \n  Lizarazo noted how he had caused a diplomatic crisis in April 2024 by ordering security forces to  storm the Mexican embassy  to arrest a former vice president wanted on corruption charges who was seeking political asylum.\n \n\n   \n  “He has clear authoritarian traits and tendencies that will very likely persist over the rest of his administration,” Lizarazo predicted. “He will continue testing institutional boundaries on executive power, and he will continue attempting to expand those executive powers to implement his strongman, hardline security agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  As for the referendum, Lizarazo said it was a “polarizing question, but Noboa has the state apparatus and communication platforms in his favor.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Noboa told CNN he intends to respect the results of the referendum whatever the result – but he’s confident Ecuador sees things the way he does.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m convinced that people want real change,” Noboa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/health/bayer-menopause-drug-fda-approval-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00Z","title":"New menopause drug to target hot flashes without hormones gets FDA approval","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved elinzanetant, marketed as Lynkuet, as a once-a-day, hormone-free treatment for moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women.

drug to target hot flashes without hormones gets FDA approval \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration has approved another once-a-day pill that works without hormones to treat moderate to severe hot flashes in menopausal women, drugmaker Bayer said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The drug, elinzanetant, is expected to be available in the United States beginning in November under the brand name Lynkuet,  Bayer said .\n \n\n   \n  It works by blocking the brain chemicals responsible for hot flashes and night sweats – what doctors call vasomotor symptoms – in menopausal women.   It’s estimated that more than 80% of women have hot flashes during menopause.\n \n\n   \n  “This FDA approval represents a bold step forward – our first hormone-free treatment for alleviating vasomotor symptoms of menopause,” Christine Roth, Bayer’s executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialization,  said in a news release  Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a need for more individualized approaches to menopause care, and Lynkuet addresses a significant gap in treatment options,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  For many women,  hormone therapy  can be a safe and effective treatment for menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. But some with underlying health conditions or histories, including certain cancers, are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies. Experts say that for those women, alternative treatment options can be helpful.\n \n\n   \n  A  Phase 3 clinical trial  of elinzanetant that included 628 postmenopausal women found that those taking the drug for 12 weeks reported a  more than 73% reduction  in the frequency of their vasomotor symptoms, or VMS. In contrast, those taking a placebo reported a 47% reduction.\n \n\n   \n  The most common side effects in women taking the drug were drowsiness, fatigue and headaches.\n \n\n   \n  “This yearlong study not only confirmed the initial findings of rapid and significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats but also provided evidence that these effects were sustained over a year, offering hope for longer-term relief,” researcher Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, UVA Health’s director of midlife health and emeritus executive director of the North American Menopause Society,  said in a statement last month  when the trial findings were published.\n \n\n   \n  “For those dealing with moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, the treatment options have been limited, especially for those who cannot or choose not to undergo hormone therapy,” Pinkerton said. “The disruptive nature of these bothersome hot flashes, particularly when they are more severe, can significantly affect women’s daily lives, both at work and at home, underscoring the urgent need for effective non-hormonal treatments.”\n \n\n   \n  Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of being very hot that’s usually centered around the face, chest and head. They can also cause   intense sweating and flushing that may last several minutes. When this happens at night, it’s called a night sweat. Women in menopause may get them occasionally or many times a day, which can be extremely disruptive.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important that women know they have choices for treating moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, and today’s approval further expands a woman’s options for treating these symptoms,” Claire Gill, president and founder of the National Menopause Foundation, said in Bayer’s announcement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In 2023, the FDA  approved  the menopause drug fezolinetant, which also works as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies for managing hot flashes. Fezolinetant and elinzanetant are among the first drugs to take advantage of a newly understood pathway in the brain that appears to control hot flashes.\n \n\n   \n  As estrogen decreases during menopause, nerves in the hypothalamus — an almond-size region deep inside the brain whose functions include helping regulate the body’s thermostat — become hyperactive and produce an overabundance of chemical signals called neurokinins. Both of the new drugs block the doorways on cells where certain neurokinins dock, which turns down their ability to stimulate the brain to cause hot flashes.\n \n\n   \n  “Hot flashes, particularly when severe, can have an impact on women’s daily lives,” Pinkerton said in Bayer’s announcement. “This approval provides healthcare providers with a new treatment option that can be used first-line for moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/kirill-dmitriev-russian-envoy-visits-us-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:16:00Z","title":"Top Russian Envoy Visits US for 'Official' Talks, Days After Trump Imposes Sanctions on Moscow","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia’s top economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has visited the United States for official talks just days after President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Russia’s major oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Dmitriev in Miami, Florida, on Saturday. GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna will also be meeting with the Russian special envoy, a source with knowledge of the visit told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Luna posted on social media that she was planning on meeting Dmitriev, saying it is important that the US continues “to foster the relationship and conversations of peace and trade” with Russia. “Our two countries do not need to be enemies. Allies in trade benefit everyone,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post on X  Friday, Dmitriev said that his visit was “planned a while ago based on an invitation from the US side.” Dialogue between his country and the US is “vital for the world and must continue with the full understanding of Russia’s position and respect for its national interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The visit comes amid growing US frustration over the Kremlin’s refusal to end its war in Ukraine and after Trump said he had “canceled” a planned summit with his Kremlin counterpart, Vladimir Putin.

At the time, his visit – during which he met with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff – was viewed as an important step in the then-warming relations between the Kremlin and the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The US government temporarily lifted sanctions against Dmitriev to allow the State Department to grant him a visa to come to the US, a source told CNN in April.\n \n\n   \n   Clarification: This article has been updated to reflect details of Rep.

Here’s what’s next \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Lauren del Valle, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:46 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James is set to go to trial in late January on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution – if she doesn’t succeed at getting the case dismissed outright.\n \n\n   \n  James was arraigned Friday morning at a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, where she pleaded not guilty to the pair of charges brought against her by a prosecutor who President Donald Trump put in the job after he complained that investigations into his political foes weren’t moving fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no fear today, no fear,” James said outside the courthouse as protesters chanted alongside her. “Because I believe that justice will rain down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”\n \n\n   \n  But it’s possible James doesn’t go to trial on January 26 at all: her attorneys previewed on Thursday and Friday their intent to try to get her case dropped in the coming months on several different grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    Halligan challenge\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers told US District Judge Jamar Walker that they are challenging whether the interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia who brought James’ case, Lindsey Halligan, is lawfully serving in the position.\n \n\n   \n  At Friday’s arraignment, the defense lawyers provided the written version of their arguments against Halligan’s authority, in an indication of how fast the case is moving already.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Halligan thus lacked the power to present this case to the grand jury or sign this indictment, and she cannot continue to supervise this prosecution … This Court must reject the Executive Branch’s brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys,”  James’ team wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The argument mirrors a similar effort underway in former FBI Director James Comey’s criminal case. Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to allegedly lying in congressional testimony, is another of Trump’s political enemies who Halligan indicted.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan was tapped for the post after Trump pushed out the former interim US attorney, Erik Seibert. Comey’s team is arguing that Seibert had already served the legally allotted maximum of 120 days that someone can serve on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers submitted earlier this week, Comey’s lawyers claimed that Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not legally able to appoint a new interim attorney and avoid the Senate confirmation process altogether. They called the move a scheme to “circumvent” Congress’ role in the confirmation process.\n \n\n   \n  A judge from South Carolina has been brought in to handle the Halligan issue and the motion in the James case will be added to that docket given the fact that they raise the same legal questions.\n \n\n   \n  It would then be up to the South Carolina judge, Cameron McGowan Currie, to decide whether she should consider them on the same track. Comey’s request is set to be heard by Currie on November 13.\n \n\n   \n  Should James and Comey succeed in persuading the judge that Halligan was unlawfully appointed, it could doom both cases since Halligan was the only prosecutor to sign the indictments.\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   \n    Selective and vindictive prosecution bid\n \n\n   \n  James has several other avenues for ridding herself of the charges ahead of trial.\n \n\n   \n  Walker asked Lowell whether he also intends to ask that the case be dismissed based on a claim that the Justice Department is unfairly criminally pursuing her. The judge specifically pointed to a motion to dismiss based on “selective or vindictive prosecution” that is pending in Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell confirmed he’d file such a motion, telling the court it’s “the worst kept secret” that James’ defense attorneys feel she’s being unfairly prosecuted .  But he stressed that his team needed to see more evidence in the case before deciding on the contours of such a claim.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s outspoken dislike for James dates back years. He’s long derided an investigation she led into him and his company as a “witch hunt.” That probe culminated in a $355 million civil judgment last year, though a New York appellate court  recently ruled  the president and his company do not have to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has called James “racist” and “corrupt,” and in 2024, while campaigning for president, said “she ought to be looked at.”\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the president posted publicly on Truth Social a message, which was apparently supposed to be private, to Attorney General Pam Bondi calling on her to move quickly in the investigation into James and others. “Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell,” the president wrote.\n \n\n   \n  James’ team has until November 7 to make the selective or vindictive prosecution request. Prosecutors will have until November 21 to respond to it and a hearing on the motion is set for December 5.\n \n\n   \n  Walker also set a separate schedule for any additional requests from James after Lowell hinted at the possibility of them challenging the charges in the case more broadly.  Those potential requests are due by November 17, and the judge said he would hold a hearing on them December 17.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/ronald-reagan-ad-trump-canada-ontario-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00-04:00","title":"What the Ronald Reagan ad that got Trump so angry was really all about","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A political controversy erupted when President Donald Trump canceled trade negotiations with Canada over a Canadian government-funded advertisement that used clips from a 1987 radio address by former President Ronald Reagan, in which he criticized tariffs and advocated for free trade.

\n        4:33 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has  canceled trade negotiations with Canada  over what he called a “ fake ” ad that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech delivered by conservative hero and former President Ronald Reagan. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute also said the ad misrepresented the former president’s words.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t fake. It was edited. But Reagan really did spend a  five-minute speech  — an April 25, 1987, national radio address that the Reagan Library has published on  YouTube  — railing against tariffs. It was a full-throated expression of support for free and fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  The  ad , purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, aired clips of the address, delivered from Camp David, where Reagan was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American attitudes toward Japan were hardening. In the recent past, Japanese companies like Toyota and Sony had flooded America’s market with high quality but inexpensive cars and electronics, harming the business of great American brands, including General Motors and RCA.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly before delivering the radio address, Reagan had placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in retaliation for the influx of cheap Japanese semiconductors to America. He had some harsh words for Japan – not included in the ad – criticizing it in terms that resembled Trump’s frequent trade missives.\n \n\n   \n  “We had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States,” Reagan said. “We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  Reagan said he would remove the tariffs only when there was evidence Japan was treating American businesses and workers fairly – also seemingly channeling one of Trump’s go-to lines.\n \n\n   \n  But Reagan was clear: He was “loath” to place trade barriers on Japan and believed high tariffs were damaging to American workers and the economy. He noted that economists widely believe that high tariffs of the  Smoot-Hawley era  had exacerbated the Great Depression, which he and others of his generation lived through – a painful memory that, he said, remained “deep and searing.”\n \n\n   \n  The bulk of Reagan’s address – and the part the ad drew from most heavily – was his description of why advanced economies had largely abandoned tariffs as an economic tool by the time he became president: They increase domestic companies’ reliance on government intervention, they reduce competition, they kick off trade wars that lead to more tariffs, they raise prices and they ultimately  lead to job losses .\n \n\n   \n  Reagan then criticizes the Democratic-controlled Congress for proposing legislation that could place more trade barriers on other countries. And, despite “certain select cases like the Japanese semiconductors,” Reagan said his administration had embraced free trade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear why Trump called the ad “fake,” but his  Truth Social post  included a critical message about the ad  posted online  by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute. It said the ad campaign used “selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan” and “misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.” The foundation didn’t say what it believed to be misrepresented.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute also claimed the government of Ontario didn’t seek permission to use or edit Reagan’s speech, although it’s not clear it was legally required to. The foundation said it was reviewing its legal options and encouraged people to  watch the unedited speech .\n \n\n   \n  The ad has run many times during high-profile events, including during the American League Championship series that featured the Toronto Blue Jays. Starting Friday night, the Ontario-based team will play in the World Series – a great source of national pride for Canadians.\n \n\n   \n  Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a  speech  on October 14 said his government had placed the ad on virtually every major US network because he wanted to “take Ronald Reagan’s words and let’s blast it to the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”\n \n\n   \n  “He was just the best president America has ever seen in my opinion,” Ford, a conservative politician, said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/investing/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"Stocks rally and Dow closes above 47,000 for first time after cooler-than-expected inflation report","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following cooler-than-expected inflation data from the Consumer Price Index, U.S. stock markets surged to record highs, with the Dow closing above 47,000 for the first time in history.

The move follows a significant military buildup, including the relocation of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group and over 4,500 US military personnel to the Caribbean, as well as CIA covert operations. While Trump has not ruled out diplomacy, he has canceled recent talks with Venezuelan officials, and administration officials suggest that operations could lead to regime change by pressuring elites benefiting from drug revenue.

Trump has also  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  The president has not ruled out taking a diplomatic approach with Venezuela to stem the flow of drugs into the US, two officials said, even after the administration cut off active talks with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in recent weeks. Venezuela is not known to be a major source of cocaine, but the Trump administration has been aggressively trying to link Maduro to the drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  “There are plans on the table that the president is considering” regarding operations on targets inside Venezuelan, one administration official told CNN, adding that “he hasn’t ruled out diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  A second official, who has been directly involved in some of the discussions, argued that there are many proposals that have been suggested to the president. A third official said the planning is happening across the government, but the focus at the highest levels is currently going after the drugs inside Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has escalated his rhetoric on potential land strikes inside Venezuela in recent days, while the US military  steadily carries out strikes  on alleged drug boats in international waters. The latest was an overnight strike against a boat allegedly smuggling narcotics in the Caribbean, killing six and bringing the total number known of targeted boats to 10 and the number of people killed to 43 since the US began its campaign last month, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has previously reported Trump has also been  weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself  as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening Maduro, and Trump himself has mused publicly about operations on land. The president, however, has not yet made clear what that would entail, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested drug “routes” might be targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Some administration officials are pushing for regime change and say that the drug campaign could lead to the ouster of Maduro. That could happen by putting pressure on people around the Venezuelan leader who have benefitted from the cartels’ illicit revenue streams, potentially squeezing them so much that they consider ways to oust the Venezuelan leader, sources told CNN.  Newly released video  shows Maduro, in English, pleading for peace.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country.\n \n\n   \n  Almost all coca crops – the main ingredient of cocaine – are concentrated in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. An annual report from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published in March did not mention Venezuela in the four pages dedicated to cocaine trafficking, citing instead Ecuador, Central America and Mexico.\n \n\n   \n  But administration officials still say some drug trafficking does go through Venezuela and point out that Maduro was indicted in 2020 on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine.\n \n\n   \n  “Nicolás Maduro, is an indicted drug trafficker in the United States, and he’s a fugitive of American justice,” Rubio said on a trip to Ecuador in September.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials cautioned that the president is “not in a rush” — as one official put it — to make a decision, given his focus his currently trained on his trip to Asia and  negotiations with Russia and Ukraine on ending their war .\n \n\n   \n  While officials said Trump was open to finding a diplomatic solution, he also called off efforts earlier this month to engage in negotiations with Maduro and top Venezuelan officials that had been led by Richard Grenell, a special presidential envoy.\n \n\n   \n  US officials also acknowledged that an aggressive operation on a target inside Venezuela would likely require congressional approval, or at least congressional briefings, before the administration could move forward.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Trump told CNN he could continue to launch strikes against alleged drug traffickers abroad  without Congress first passing an official declaration of war . And while he said he would notify Congress about any operations on land, he contended he would not face any pushback.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We’re going to kill them, you know, they’re going to be like, dead.”\n \n\n   \n  The buildup of US forces has also raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. Pentagon press secretary Sean Parnell said in a statement posted on X that the move of the Gerald R. Ford strike group and its associated air wing was meant to “dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and counter narco-terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ford strike group docked near the harbor of Split, Croatia, on October 21. That would leave the carrier and its accompanying ships more than 5,000 miles from the Caribbean, meaning it would take days for the group to be in position to launch any strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the Ford’s arrival, a significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally had been relocated to  US Southern Command , the US military’s command responsible for operations in the region, according to a fleet tracker published by the United States Naval Institute’s news portal.\n \n\n   \n  That includes the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is also now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/economy/us-cpi-september-expensive","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"What Got More Expensive in September","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, inflation pressures in the U.S. continued to rise, particularly in food and services sectors.

expensive in September \n       \n  By Alicia Wallace, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Here’s a rundown of what got more expensive in  September’s Consumer Price Index  report — as well as a couple of key areas where consumers are seeing relief.\n \n\n   \n  But first, a caveat: Monthly data can be quite volatile — and that could be even more volatile amid federal cuts and BLS staffing limitations that have impacted how data is collected — so it’s important to look at longer-term trends.\n \n\n   \n    At the grocery store\n \n\n   \n  Grocery prices bolted higher in August, rising 0.6%, which was the highest in nearly three years; however, in September, they rose at a comparably modest 0.3%. For the year, they’re running below overall inflation at a 2.7% rate, BLS data shows.\n \n\n   \n  The dairy case is doing its part to cool down overall food-at-home inflation: Egg prices have dropped after the  avian flu-related issues were resolved , and plentiful production and supply for milk and butter and food oils have kept price hikes at bay.\n \n\n   \n  The same can’t be said for other aisles in the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n   Beef and veal:  In September, prices for uncooked beef roasts rose 4.8%, their largest increase in four years. The broader beef and veal index rose 1.2% in September and is up 14.7% from a year before.\n \n\n   \n   In recent months, the average price of beef has hit record highs, a milestone caused by a  yearslong trend  of drought, shrinking herds and the rise of imported beef.\n \n\n   \n   Lunchmeats:  The beef trend doesn’t bode well here. Prices of the handy sandwich fixings rose 4.2%, the largest on record for the category.\n \n\n   \n   Fresh sweetrolls, coffeecakes, doughnuts:  Cue the “d’oh” from the doughtnut-loving crowd. In September, prices for these delectable baked goods rose 5.7%. That’s the highest monthly increase for that category in more than 26 years.\n \n\n   \n  It’s likely one part lagged effect from prior price spikes in main ingredients (like eggs wheat, spices and sugar) and one part post-pandemic changes in consumer demand and labor patterns, BLS researchers noted earlier this year when analyzed baked goods prices.\n \n\n   \n   Coffee:  America’s favorite caffeinated beverage actually got cheaper in September — this index fell by 0.1%. But this is where that monthly caveat comes in hand: September’s little dip comes after seven consecutive months of price hikes ranging from 0.9% to 3.6%.\n \n\n   \n  For the year, coffee prices are up 18.9%. It’s even worse if you like the quick fix of instant — that’s up 21.7%, which is the highest annual inflation since the summer of 1995.  And it’s very possible it won’t stop there  if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to enact steeper tariffs on Colombian shipments. Key coffee-exporter Brazil also faces a 50% levy.\n \n\n   \n    The services economy\n \n\n   \n   At-home care for elderly and people with disabilities : Prices here soared 7% in September, marking the highest-ever monthly increase for this category (which the BLS started tracking in December 2005). On an annual basis, they’re up 11.6%.\n \n\n   \n  Health care costs are on the rise, and that’s especially been the case for the care economy, where providers are  facing funding shortfalls  (that have been exacerbated by new budget cuts). That has contributed to low wages, which have led to worker shortages (now exacerbated by  immigration reductions ), which in turn have resulted in care deserts, further putting upward pressure on prices — and, in turn,  negative labor market outcomes .\n \n\n   \n   Admission to sporting events:  The kick-off to football season came with a heftier hit to the pocketbook. The price for fandom went up 3.7% from August, according to BLS data, which accounts for seasonality.\n \n\n   \n  On an annual basis, sporting event tickets are down by about 6.9%; however, this category might be highlighting a “K-shaped economy” trend that’s influencing pricing.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers at the higher end of the income spectrum are still spending relatively freely on discretionary services, and that is putting upward pressure on airfares and on hotel prices” and other related categories, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.\n \n\n   \n   Airline fares:  Ticket prices were up 2.7% on a monthly basis, further driving the annual rate to 3.2%.\n \n\n   \n    Tariff effect on goods\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s substantial and widespread tariffs are having an effect on overall inflation, but instead of a surge, the pass-through to consumers has been  ongoing, gradual and uneven  (for a multitude of reasons).\n \n\n   \n  It’s a slow bleed that’s expected to continue into early next year, but some of the impacts are already being felt.\n \n\n   \n  “The grocery segment, of course, is one of the prime ones,” Daco said. “Yes, we do produce some fruits and vegetables and some meat, but we also import a lot of produce and other items that are in our grocery stores.”\n \n\n   \n  So, it makes sense why products like bananas (+6.9% annually), canned fruits and vegetables (+5%)   and sugar and sweets (+6.7%) are rising at their fastest annual rates in years.\n \n\n   \n  The tariffs are also showing up in other non-grocery goods that saw notable price increases in September:\n \n\n   \n   Watches:  Monthly price shifts in this category can be quite volatile; however, the trend in recent years — as with many other goods — is generally one of falling prices. That wasn’t the case in August, when watch prices went up 1.9%, or in September, when they rose 3.2%, bringing the annual rate to 6.6%.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the United States imposed a 39% tariff on Switzerland,  which is one of the top exporters of watches to America .\n \n\n   \n   Boys’ apparel:  The back-to-school shopping season was met with plenty of sticker shock in August, and that continued in September. This category rose 2.6%, which was the largest monthly increase in more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  Many articles of clothing and accessories are made outside the United States in countries such as Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam,  leaving them greatly exposed to tariffs .\n \n\n   \n   Furniture and appliances:  Shelter-related services inflation, which carries the biggest weight in the CPI, slowed further in September. But the prices of goods that fill homes definitely did not.\n \n\n   \n  “Other furniture,” which can include desks, bookcases and the like, saw price increases of 1.9%, the highest in nearly two years and is at its highest annual inflation rate in nearly three years. There’s a similar story for appliances, which are up 1.3% from the year before (after a 0.8% rise in September).\n \n\n   \n  Trump in recent months extended tariffs to  appliances  and has vowed to enact  even more “substantial” tariffs on furniture .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/trump-ends-trade-negotiations-canada","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he’s ending Canada trade negotiations over anti-tariff ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has terminated U.S.-Canada trade negotiations in response to a controversial advertisement launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, which used a clip from a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech criticizing tariffs.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  said on Thursday he was terminating trade talks with Canada, threatening once again to upend the crucial economic relationship between the United States and its second-biggest trading partner.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he canceled the talks in response to an advertisement released last week by the government of Canada’s Ontario province – which the premier now says he plans to pull – that featured audio from  a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan  criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that after speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the US ad campaign would pause on Monday “so that trade talks can resume” – but not before it runs during MLB’s World Series games over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said on X. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. I’ve directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.”\n \n\n   \n  In the 1987 speech, Reagan lambasted tariffs as hurting “every American worker and consumer” and “triggering fierce trade wars.”\n \n\n   \n  After the ad aired, the Ronald Reagan Foundation claimed it “misrepresents” the speech, and that the Ontario government had not asked permission to use the clip.\n \n\n   \n  While the ad edited the speech and lacked context, the theme of Reagan’s full  five-minute speech , which the Reagan Library has published on  YouTube , is full-throated support for free and fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan delivered it from Camp David, where he was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American sentiment for the country was eroding after its companies flooded America’s market with inexpensive cars and electronics.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan had just placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products to try to stem the damage the imports of cheap Japanese semiconductors had done to US manufacturers. But Reagan was clear: he was “loath” to take that action and believed high tariffs had exacerbated the Great Depression.\n \n\n   \n  Yet by Thursday night, Trump had taken to social media to blast the ad.\n \n\n   \n  “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  He claimed the ad aimed to “interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,” and defended tariffs as critical to the US economy and national security.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate Truth Social post  Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,” Trump posted. “Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney said Friday his country “can’t control the trade policy of the US.”\n \n\n   \n  “We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, the 2000s, and it’s a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners in different countries,” he told reporters shortly before boarding a plane to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  Carney said that tariff negotiations with the US had yielded “a lot of progress.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to the office of Dominic LeBlanc, the minister overseeing US-Canada trade.\n \n\n   \n  Ford had first posted the ad online on October 16, writing in a caption: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.”\n \n\n   \n  A disclaimer under the ad states that it was not approved or sponsored by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library or the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  Along with its statement, the Ronald Reagan Foundation offered a link to the full unabridged version of Reagan’s decades-old speech — in which he speaks at greater length about why he opposes tariffs. “More than five million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports,” he said in one quote, which was not included in the ad.\n \n\n   \n  The description for the full YouTube video lists the speech as “unrestricted” in both access and use.\n \n\n   \n    Growing tension\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump took office, the centuries-long friendship between the US and Canada has  broken down  amid  bruised feelings  over tariffs and Trump’s  threat to make Canada the 51st US state . Many Canadians are boycotting American goods, and refusing to travel to the US.\n \n\n   \n  Canada has long been one of the US’ top trading partners; last year, the US imported $411.9 billion worth of goods from Canada, according to government figures.\n \n\n   \n  But Canada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s steep sectoral tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber, and energy — some of the country’s key exports to the US. Those fall under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump brokered during his first term and will be under mandatory review next year. Canada’s unemployment rate is now at its highest point in nine years.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the last thing that either country needs,” Jack Buffington, director of the supply chain program at the University of Denver, told CNN after Trump’s announcement. “We need to stabilize the North American supply chain, particularly given the challenges that the US has with China.”\n \n\n   \n  Carney won an election in April with a strident message for Canadians, warning that their relationship with America would change dramatically in the coming years. He has fostered relationships with other Western countries instead; on Thursday, before Trump’s post, he had announced on X that Canada plans to double its non-US exports in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Our core mission is to build a stronger economy — one that doesn’t rely on a single trade partner,” he wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  The economic relationship has reached a boiling point several times over the course of Trump’s second term. Earlier this year, in the relationship’s tensest moment, Ford threatened to halt exports of Canadian electricity to the United States, which would have sent US energy bills surging. But he ultimately backed off that threat. Trump has also threatened to call off talks with Canada in the past, only to restore negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have eased slightly in recent months, however, with  Carney meeting Trump  at the Oval Office earlier this month. There, Trump joked about a “merger” of the two countries but also praised his counterpart as a “world-class leader.”\n \n\n   \n  LeBlanc, the Canadian trade minister, said negotiators for both countries had left with directions to “quickly land deals” on steel, aluminum and energy. He described the meeting between leaders as “successful, positive, substantial.”\n \n\n   \n  That brief warming, it seems, is over — at least for now.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/tennessee-plant-explosion-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"15:12:00Z","title":"Blast at Tennessee Explosives Plant Kills 16, Investigation Underway","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in Tennessee on October 10, 2025, killed 16 employees and triggered a widespread investigation.

The catastrophe at a  Tennessee explosives plant  started in a building that made devices used for mining and detonated more than 24,000 pounds of explosives, authorities said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The October 10 disaster killed 16 employees at  Accurate Energetic Systems , which makes military and demolition explosives about 60 miles west of Nashville. The blast was so intense, it registered as a 1.6 magnitude earthquake, according to data from the  U.S. Geological Survey .\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen of the victims were quickly identified with the help of  rapid DNA testing . But two weeks later, the remaining two victims’ remains have not been found, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said.\n \n\n   \n  The searches for the victims and the cause of the blast have been treacherous, with debris hurled miles away and  possible landmines scattered  throughout.\n \n\n   \n  While the cause of the blast remains a mystery, investigators have figured out where the calamity started, said Brice McCracken, special agent in charge at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ National Center for Explosives Training and Research.\n \n\n   \n  The “blast seat” was Building 602, a 15,000-square-foot structure that made explosives used for mining, McCracken said. By the end of the disaster, about 24,000 to 28,000 pounds of explosives had been detonated.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have theories about what might have caused the explosion, said Jamey VanVliet, special agent in charge of the ATF’s Nashville Field Division. But he declined to name those theories or speculate on a potential cause as the investigation continues.\n \n\n   \n    Another half ton of explosives found\n \n\n   \n  During their dangerous search, authorities scoured 500 acres of wooded property looking for victims and explosive hazards, McCracken said.\n \n\n   \n  They found about 1,000 pounds of undetonated explosives, all of which were safely disposed of, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no indication of threat to public safety,” VanVliet said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have spent “nearly every daylight hour processing this enormous scene” over the past two weeks, VanVliet said Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, that part of our work – processing the scene – is complete,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The next phase of the investigation will happen at ATF labs and testing facilities, where evidence will be examined in hopes of finding the cause of the tragedy.\n \n\n   \n    ‘2 souls’ have yet to be found\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have identified the 16 victims as Jason Adams, Erick Anderson, Billy Baker, Adam Boatman, Christopher Clark, Mindy Clifton, James Cook, Reyna Gillahan, LeTeisha Mays, Jeremy Moore, Melinda Rainey, Melissa Stanford, Trenton Stewart, Rachel Woodall, Steven Wright and Donald Yowell.\n \n\n   \n  “It really saddens me that we still have two souls that we have not been able to locate,” the sheriff said Friday. “I’ve talked with both of those families last night and this morning. We still have some testing to do,” which Davis said he hopes will be completed in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, safety concerns have been raised at the plant. Federal records show the plant faced fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices.\n \n\n   \n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  fined  the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. The company contested the findings and eventually reached a formal settlement, OSHA records show.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement posted on its website, Accurate Energetic Systems said it is “shocked and devastated” by the loss of 16 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “These team members are our family, our friends, our neighbors – it is impossible to comprehend,” CEO Wendell Stinson said.\n \n\n   \n  “We maintain high industry standards and have regular reviews by state and federal regulators, and we also lead our industry with significant roles within national safety organizations.

      \nUpdated: \n        3:10 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump canceled trade talks with Canada on Thursday, citing a recent ad released by the government of Canada’s Ontario province that quoted former President Ronald Reagan’s  1987 radio address to the nation on fair trade .\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the  ad , which aired in the US, was “fake,”  though it was in fact edited  using real clips from Reagan’s five-minute talk ahead of a meeting on trade with Japan’s prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  CNN analyzed key excerpts from the speech below. Quotes from the ad are highlighted.\n \n\n   \n  As you might notice, the Reagan comments the government of Ontario used actually came in the context of him levying new tariffs against Japan — rather than a general broadside against the concept of tariffs. This reinforces that Reagan did sometimes use tariffs. He emphasized not just free trade, but fair trade.\n \n\n   \n  In this case, he accused Japan of failing to abide by a 1986 agreement and allowing for the  dumping of semiconductor chips into the markets , which harmed American producers’ ability to compete. He levied 100% tariffs on Japanese laptop computers, power tools and television sets, among other items. It was the first major trade retaliation against Japan since World War II.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan’s remark that he is “loathe” to impose tariffs is where we start to get into the contrast with Trump’s approach, which has been to levy huge tariffs on many countries in the service of negotiating. Reagan White House officials repeatedly emphasized this was a step they didn’t want to take, but they had their hand forced. “Nobody wants a trade war, but nobody wants to be a patsy either,” Reagan White House chief of staff Howard Baker  said  shortly before the tariffs were announced.\n \n\n   \n  This section is another notable difference from Trump. While Trump initially billed his tariffs as being about unfair trade policies, that justification quickly came into question. He’s justified his tariff threats using a multitude of reasons, including sometimes  dubious claims of alleged drug-trafficking , Denmark  refusing to sell Greenland  to the United States, and most recently on Thursday, him being upset about an ad from the government of Ontario. The formula for Trump’s initial “Liberation Day” worldwide tariffs also, quite notably, was focused not on specific unfair trade policies,  but rather trade imbalances .\n \n\n   \n  The line about “free trade” and also “fair trade” was indeed a theme of Reagan’s presidency. But Reagan also frequently emphasized that his tendency was toward the free side of trade. He routinely derided the protectionism that Trump now hails.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism,” he said in 1988, crediting Americans for rejecting “the siren song of protectionism.”\n \n\n   \n  “So-called protectionism is almost always self-destructive, doing more harm than good even to those it’s supposed to be helping,” he said in 1985. And contrary to Trump’s posture about unequal trade, Reagan said in 1987 that “protectionism is not the way to resolve our trade imbalance.”\n \n\n   \n  Reagan often railed against Smoot-Hawley, a package of large tariffs signed into law in 1930 that many historians indeed say worsened the Great Depression. Trump has taken the polar opposite view. He  claimed in April  that the depression “would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy. It would have been a much different story.”\n \n\n   \n  This epitomizes the differences between Trump and Reagan on tariffs. Trump has  hailed the power of tariffs  and the impact they could have on American manufacturing. He has called tariffs the “most beautiful word in the dictionary.” Reagan, by contrast, generally cast tariffs as a necessary evil that sometimes needed to be invoked — and cast arguments that tariffs are pro-American as political pandering.\n \n\n   \n  Reagan was clear that he viewed trade wars as bad and best to be avoided. Trump has said that “ trade wars are good, and easy to win .”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is currently going much further than even many congressional Republicans seem comfortable with on his tariffs. But the situation with Reagan was often the opposite. Congress back then tried to go further than Reagan on tariffs, and he repeatedly  vetoed bills he viewed as too protectionist .\n \n\n   \n  If there’s some commonality between Reagan and Trump, it’s in how neither wanted to be constrained by Congress on this issue. Reagan here was referring to an effort in Congress that called for even tougher retaliation against countries like Japan. He later  vetoed the legislation .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/social-security-cola-increase-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"14:08:00Z","title":"Social Security Monthly Benefits Will Increase 2.8% in 2026","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2026, Social Security recipients will receive a 2.8% increase in monthly benefits, slightly above the 2.5% 2025 adjustment but significantly lower than the peak 8.7% boost from 2023.

2.8% in 2026 \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:08 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Social Security recipients will receive a 2.8% boost in their monthly benefits in 2026, the Social Security Administration announced Friday. However, many seniors say the annual adjustments haven’t been enough to cover their ever-rising expenses.\n \n\n   \n  The increase for 2026 is larger than the  2.5% cost-of-living-adjustment  that beneficiaries received for this year, but far smaller than the ones for the few years before that, when inflation was running rampant.\n \n\n   \n  Monthly payments for retired workers will rise by about $56 to an estimated average of $2,071 starting in January, the agency said. Nearly 71 million senior citizens, people with disabilities and others receive Social Security benefits.\n \n\n   \n  (A total of 75 million Americans receive either Social Security or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits from the agency. Some receive both.)\n \n\n   \n  The annual adjustment, known as a COLA, is based on an inflation metric from the third quarter of the year. Inflation has moderated after being at around a four-decade high in 2022, which resulted in an  8.7% adjustment  for 2023.\n \n\n   \n  A related metric, the Consumer Price Index,  rose 3%  in September compared with a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The COLA increase was scheduled to be announced last week but was  delayed  by the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A good chunk of beneficiaries’ COLA for 2026 will likely be erased by an increase in Medicare Part B premiums, which is expected to be released next month. The monthly premium for 2026 is forecast to jump to more than $206, up from $185 this year, according to Medicare’s most recent trustees report. That would be about twice the increase for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  For the average beneficiary, the higher projected Medicare premium would eat away at nearly half the bump in Social Security benefits, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group, said in a statement. For some, the premium increase would consume their entire COLA.\n \n\n   \n    Not keeping up with expenses\n \n\n   \n  Social Security recipients have long complained that the annual COLA has not kept up with their actual expenses. In fact, the benefits lost 20% of their  buying power  between 2010 and 2024, according to an analysis last year from The Senior Citizens League. Those who retired in 2010 would need a boost of $370 a month, or $4,443 a year, on average, to regain the lost value.\n \n\n   \n  Over the last decade, the annual increase has been about 3.1%, on average, according to Social Security. Since it is based on the prior year’s inflation rate, it may not reflect the change in prices that beneficiaries are currently experiencing.\n \n\n   \n  Also, AARP has advocated for the COLA formula to better represent senior citizens’ costs, particularly since they typically have higher health care expenses.\n \n\n   \n  “The CPI for working Americans doesn’t quite capture what the spending patterns are for older Americans,” Joel Eskovitz, senior director of Social Security at AARP’s Public Policy Institute, told CNN. “It’s close, but there are just different things that working Americans spend on than retired Americans.”\n \n\n   \n    Looking for help and cutting back\n \n\n   \n  Many retirees depend heavily on Social Security — it’s the primary source of income for 40% of older Americans, according to AARP.\n \n\n   \n  While Sam Ciraulo is appreciative of any bump in benefits, he said it won’t be enough to buy a tank of gas.\n \n\n   \n  A retired adjunct professor who resides in Sacramento, California, Ciraulo lives off roughly $1,400 in monthly Social Security benefits and food stamps.

\n  By Amanda Musa, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:30 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one  tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters  in a Chicago neighborhood Thursday in a potential violation of a judge’s order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics during anti-ICE protests.\n \n\n   \n  A new court filing against the Department of Homeland Security alleges Bovino “apparently threw tear gas into a crowd without justification” during a protest against federal immigration authorities in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  The notice of alleged violation was filed by a combination of media groups, individual protesters and Chicago-area clergy members who earlier this month  obtained a temporary restraining order  from US District Judge Sara Ellis after suing DHS and Trump officials over federal agents’ tactics against protesters. Ellis was appointed by former President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, 55, has  emerged as the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.\n \n\n   \n  The new court filing cites a Facebook video post that shows Bovino throw an object toward protesters Thursday morning. The video, which CNN has viewed, does not show clearly what happened in the minutes leading up to the alleged incident or if any warnings were given.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino appears to throw either one or two tear gas canisters over the heads of armed federal agents in front of him and in the direction of a crowd of individuals protesting, including an individual filming the encounter,” the filing from Thursday states.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  sweeping order  restricts agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists and others at protests in Chicago, but it includes exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others. During a hearing  last week , she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino is one of more than a dozen administration officials named as defendants in the lawsuit filed earlier this month, which accuses federal agents of “a pattern of extreme brutality” intended to “silence the press and civilians.”\n \n\n   \n  “Riot control measures were deployed, including by Bovino, and arrests were made. Agents properly used their training,” DHS said in a Friday post on  X . “The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours before the court filing alleging a possible violation of the judge’s order, Bovino defended federal agents’ conduct in the Chicago area during an  interview with CBS News .\n \n\n   \n  “The use of force I’ve seen has been exemplary. By exemplary, I would say the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,” Bovino said, in response to attacks he’s seen carried out on federal agents by “extremists and others.”\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Chicago have ramped up since federal agents were deployed on the city’s streets early September during what the Trump administration has titled “ Operation Midway Blitz, ” a targeted crackdown on illegal immigration that has led to over 1,000 arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents’ response to the demonstrations has drawn widespread outcry, notably when  an area pastor  was  seen on video  being shot in the head with pepper balls by officers perched on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Bovino insisted such tactics do not necessarily violate DHS policy, telling CBS: “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them. Don’t protest, and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has ordered Bovino be deposed in the case and a preliminary injunction hearing is set for November 5. On Thursday, the court expanded Bovino’s deposition time to five hours.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino, who formally heads Border Patrol’s El Centro sector in California, has been leading the federal crackdown in Chicago after helming similar operations in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  His heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled consternation among some in the Trump administration while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the  Illinois Accountability Commission  “to pursue accountability for the people of Illinois,” amid the surge in federal immigration enforcement in his state.\n \n\n   \n  The commission is charged with creating a public record of federal enforcement abuses, capturing the impact of the enforcements on families and communities in Illinois, and recommending actions to “prevent further harm and to pursue justice,” Pritzker said.\n \n\n   \n  Criticism over federal authorities’ tactics in Chicago comes amid the broader legal battle over Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops in the city.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, US District Court Judge April Perry  ordered an extension  of the order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment. The Trump administration is urging  the Supreme Court  to allow the deployment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/binance-zhao-trump-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-04:00","title":"What is Binance, and what CZ’s pardon could mean for US crypto investors","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, has received a pardon from President Donald Trump, reigniting concerns about political influence and the ability of wealthy individuals to bypass legal consequences.

Analysis by Allison Morrow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Changpeng Zhao, one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, is back in the spotlight this week after  securing a pardon  from President Donald Trump — a reprieve that renews concerns that those with deep pockets have been able to buy their way out of trouble under Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to overstate how much Zhao, who goes by “CZ,” has shaped the crypto industry since he launched Binance in 2017 and grew it into the world’s largest trading platform for digital assets.\n \n\n   \n  Put simply: If you want to take, say, $100 from your bank account and use it to buy or sell cryptocurrencies virtually anywhere in the world, Binance facilitates that process, and takes a small fee off of every trade. It also offers more complex financial services like margin trading and “staking,” a way for investors to earn passive returns on their crypto holdings.\n \n\n   \n  Not only is Binance by far the world’s biggest crypto exchange, as measured by both user count (280 million globally) and trading volume (more than $217 billion daily), it boasts  40% of the market share  among centralized crypto exchanges.\n \n\n   \n  But   Binance hasn’t always complied with rules governing the sale of financial services in various jurisdictions, including in the US, which effectively banned the global version of the platform in 2019. (In response, Binance launched a more limited service, Binance.US, though in practice many users within US borders found ways around the ban, according to media reports and the Department of Justice.)\n \n\n   \n  US federal prosecutors said in a 2023 that Binance  had become a hub for bad actors , enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics, terrorist financing and money laundering. Binance also lacked protocols — standard for financial services companies — to report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. One compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents:    “we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.’”\n \n\n   \n  The company and Zhao pleaded guilty in the United States to money-laundering violations. As part of a settlement with the government, Zhao stepped down as CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and served a four-month sentence in federal prison. Zhao still owns an estimated 90% of the company, giving him an estimated net worth of  more than $80 billion , according to Forbes.\n \n\n   \n  Zhao remains synonymous with Binance, and he retained his industry clout even after he went to prison. On Friday, Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian national who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, reflected on his recent ups and downs,  stating : “My official record was tarnished for a bit, but my reputation held strong. No one, not a single person, stopped doing business with me.”\n \n\n   \n    Why does it matter?\n \n\n   \n  For years, crypto in the United States was a largely theoretical project — a parallel financial system led by a community of extremely online pioneers, who believed the future of money lay in computer networks outside the control of governments or central banks.\n \n\n   \n  But 16 years in, crypto has ballooned to a $3.5 trillion industry with growing exposure to mainstream finance, due in part to Trump’s evolution from skeptic to full-fledged crypto mogul. Just this week, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said  crypto assets “are no longer on the fringes”  and “increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems” — a stunning acknowledgement for an industry that nearly imploded just three years ago with the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s once high-flying competitor to Binance.\n \n\n   \n  Institutional interest in crypto has shot up with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, and Congress recently passed an industry-approved regulatory bill that proponents hope will increase adoption. There’s a long way to go, however, as most Americans (63%) have little or no confidence in crypto as a safe investment,  according to Pew Research.  \n \n\n   \n  Crypto proponents also embraced Trump’s re-election — the industry became the  biggest corporate donor  in the 2024 general election — and Trump embraced crypto right back.\n \n\n   \n  Trump took to crypto with the zeal of the converted, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world, and even embracing fringe elements that  made many advocates uneasy  — like launching his own memecoin, a kind of souvenir token closely associated with scams, pardoning the notorious founder of the criminal Silk Road marketplace, and calling for the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve, which would enrich early adopters while undermining the anti-establishment ethos of crypto’s founding.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s vast crypto empire is  perhaps the most problematic  of the president’s conflicts of interest, making  earlier ethics debates  over his hotel and casino business interests look downright quaint. There is virtually no cap on how much money can flow to the Trump family via crypto.\n \n\n   \n    The Trumps and Binance\n \n\n   \n  The president’s pardon of Zhao exemplifies those ethical concerns because Binance has direct financial ties to the Trump family’s crypto business.\n \n\n   \n  In March, the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial launched a dollar-pegged token known as a  stablecoin  — popular assets in crypto because their value remains constant, while most other token prices are prone to volatility.\n \n\n   \n  According to  Bloomberg , Binance wrote the basic code to power World Liberty’s stablecoin, USD1, and has promoted the coin to its 280 million users around the globe.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the coin launched this spring, a UAE-based firm announced it would use USD1 to take a $2 billion stake in Binance — using USD1, a deal that is expected to generate millions in returns for World Liberty, which is controlled jointly by the Trumps and the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Mideast negotiator.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/california-redistricting-kevin-mccarthy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"Republican tensions rise over Kevin McCarthy’s faltering push to fight California redistricting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin McCarthy’s Republican effort to block California’s Proposition 50—aimed at reversing redistricting drawn by an independent commission and replacing it with Democratic lines—has failed to meet its $100 million fundraising goal, resulting in a severe financial deficit.

     \nUpdated: \n        12:05 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This summer, a fired-up Kevin McCarthy vowed to personally lead the fight against  California Democrats’ redistricting push , aiming to raise $100 million to help protect Republican lawmakers in his home state.\n \n\n   \n  But in the final weeks of the high-stakes election, the former GOP speaker has fallen massively short of that mark, according to people familiar with the fundraising goal he set. That has required more direct involvement from both the White House and GOP leadership, those people said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledge that they always faced an uphill battle to defeat Democratic  Gov. Gavin Newsom  on the referendum, known as Proposition 50, in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 4.5 million voters. But multiple Republicans told CNN that McCarthy and the groups involved in the campaign squandered a critical early window to craft a compelling message and raise the financial resources necessary to compete.\n \n\n   \n  Now, even some senior House GOP leaders privately concede the measure is on track to pass, another Republican source said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is an opportunity that is being wasted,” one House GOP lawmaker from California told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people are frustrated … a lot of money could have gone into this,” the member said, noting that the fundraising is “nowhere near what normally happens in an election cycle.”\n \n\n   \n  This lawmaker was among several Republicans who told CNN that they had been expecting a major influx of GOP cash that simply did not materialize.\n \n\n   \n  Groups opposing Proposition 50 have spent a total of about $31 million so far on TV advertising while groups supporting the measure have spent more than $80 million, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. That gap has grown over the last four weeks, over which the “No” side has spent just $3 million on ad time, while the “Yes” side has spent more than $40 million.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s committee was meant to ramp up its spending in the final weeks of the campaign, a source familiar with the “No” side’s thinking told CNN. But that spending didn’t materialize to the level Republicans hoped. The group, “No on 50 – Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab,” has raised just $11.4 million, according to recent campaign finance data.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not raising money at a time when it really desperately needs those resources,” the source said. “So, the prognosis for this specific campaign doesn’t look terribly good.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for McCarthy didn’t respond to requests for comment. But Jessica Millan Patterson, a former state GOP party chair who is running the McCarthy-backed committee, said her group would continue working to oppose the measure despite the spending disadvantage.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to continue to raise the money that’s necessary to get out the vote, to make sure that we are persuading individuals that can be persuaded, and at the end of the day, make sure that we defeat this partisan power grab,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She also pushed back on reports that McCarthy planned to raise $100 million.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Politico is confused,” she told CNN, referencing the outlet that first reported the total. “That’s a number that the Democrats said that they were going to spend, and we are often outspent.”\n \n\n   \n  But multiple sources told CNN that McCarthy had, indeed, told fellow Republicans he was aiming for $100 million and said they expected McCarthy to invest far more than he has for the race.\n \n\n   \n  Some in Trump’s orbit are openly   blaming McCarthy, who resigned from Congress in 2023 soon  after losing his speakership .\n \n\n   \n  Steve Bannon, a longtime McCarthy antagonist who is close to Trump, confirmed that White House officials were frustrated with McCarthy over the redistricting initiative. “Very very pissed,” he wrote in a text message to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “A defeat on Prop 50 makes Newsom the automatic Democrat front runner for ’28 — that’s why it was essential to get the President engaged early in this fight —a fight that could be won,” Bannon said. “The great minds of the Republicans never engaged, leaving us without our best weapon — MAGA.”\n \n\n   \n    Momentum grows for the ‘Yes’ vote\n \n\n   \n  Newsom and fellow Democrats seized national attention by launching their referendum effort following  Texas Republicans’ move  to launch a rare mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in the California legislature voted to place Proposition 50 on the November ballot in August. If voters approve the measure, it would temporarily replace congressional maps drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission with new ones crafted by California Democrats. The new lines would be in place through the 2030 election.\n \n\n   \n  The Newsom-backed Yes coalition – made up of unions, advocacy groups and prominent national Democrats including  former President Barack Obama  – has argued that their party must “fight fire with fire” to combat Republican gerrymandering in other states done at the behest of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are now entering the November 4 election with high confidence.\n \n\n   \n  A CBS/YouGov poll found that 62% of likely California voters plan to or have already voted yes on Proposition 50, including 85% of Democrats, 60% of independents and 22% of Republicans. Thirty-eight percent of likely voters said they would or have already voted no. Half of voters said they were motivated by a desire to oppose the president.\n \n\n   \n  If the measure indeed passes, five Republican-held districts will be redrawn to be more favorable for Democrats, erasing part of the seven-seat advantage Republicans hope to gain from redrawing maps in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has pressured other GOP-led states to redraw their maps as he hopes to prevent Democrats from winning control of the US House in next year’s midterms, giving them power to disrupt the final two years of his second term.\n \n\n   \n    The Republican side still has raised tens of millions\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have still raised some serious money:  Charles Munger Jr. , son of the late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger, kicked off the opposition’s spending with more than $30 million. The second-biggest funder has been the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by House GOP leadership, which chipped in $13 million.\n \n\n   \n  Corrin Rankin, the chair of the California Republican Party, said the state GOP’s goal has always been to spend wisely and focus on turning out Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re always going to be outraised,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Shawn Steel, who is leading the state Republican Party’s efforts, said he had “zero expectations” about the financial resources the California GOP would receive. Still, he aggressively pitched national Republicans in Washington, DC, on fighting Proposition 50 and was able to raise $10.8 million for the party, he said. Steel said he also urged people to back the McCarthy effort.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s gotten some. It hasn’t been insignificant,” said. “I wish he had more funding, because he really knows California very well. He’s the only recent-day Republican that’s gotten a lot of people elected to Congress.”\n \n\n   \n    A more fractured opposition\n \n\n   \n  The “No on 50” coalition has been more fractured than the “Yes” side. Different organizations are working to reach different segments of the voting population.\n \n\n   \n  The California Farm Bureau has been urging their members to oppose the measure as well, arguing that the district lines cut up rural districts in the northern and central parts of the state and combine them with more urban areas.\n \n\n   \n  “This, for us, is not a partisan issue,” said Shannon Douglass, the group’s president.\n \n\n   \n  Munger, who helped fund the ballot initiatives that created the independent commission, has targeted “good government” Democrats and independents who want to preserve the power of the independent commission.\n \n\n   \n  Amy Thoma Tan, a spokesperson for the Munger group, said they’re feeling “cautiously optimistic” about November 4.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters are voting, and they are starting to understand what getting rid of the redistricting commission would do,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The question is what resources will be available to push that message. Thoma Tan declined to say whether Munger would invest more money, pointing to Munger’s recent statement that he will only discuss political strategy after the election.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, were quick to launch a massive organizing effort both in DC and in Sacramento that led to near-record fundraising levels. One of those organizers, California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, said the party has found a way to translate their base’s deep frustration and anger at Trump into tangible action.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard for so many months, ‘Democrats need to do something.’ I think with Prop 50 we are giving people something that can be done,” Aguilar told CNN. “The ‘no’ side kind of underestimated that people wanted to do something. And this is a moment of action.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/economy/us-cpi-consumer-prices-inflation-september","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-04:00","title":"America’s inflation is back at 3% — higher than normal but not out of control","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, U.S. inflation rose to 3%, the highest level since January, driven by a 4.1% surge in gas prices and rising prices in apparel, home furnishings, and appliances—linked to President Donald Trump’s import tariffs.

And housing-related inflation also continued its lengthy slowdown.\n \n\n   \n  Economists were expecting that inflation would continue to pick up speed, rising 0.4% for the month and 3.1% from the year before, according to FactSet estimates.\n \n\n   \n  Excluding food and energy, which can be quite volatile, the core measure of CPI rose 0.2% in September, with an annual inflation rate settling out at 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Although better than economists had expected, Friday’s inflation data is a disconcerting reminder that prices are still rising faster than they typically should.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a psychological milestone of being back at that 3% level again,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an interview with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Due to inflation, the typical American household is spending $208 more a month in September to purchase the same goods and services as they were a year ago, and $1,043 more a month than they did at the start of 2021, coming out of the pandemic, new data from Moody’s Analytics showed.\n \n\n   \n  The softer inflation reading for September gives a green light to a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting next week, wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rupkey cautioned that the better-than-expected report might also be painting a rosier picture than actually exists.\n \n\n   \n  “The immediate dangers from Trump 2.0 tariff policies have not yet fed through to inflation overall,” he wrote in a note to investors Friday. “The market will likely hold their applause, however, as one reason inflation is held in check may be due to the economic slowdown seen in many labor market indicators.”\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s report provided further evidence that President Donald Trump’s steep import tariffs are causing certain goods prices to move higher. Categories such as apparel, home furnishings, footwear and appliances all continued to see price increases last month, and a closely watched inflation index (core goods excluding autos) is up 1.3% annually, which is the highest since August 2023.\n \n\n   \n  However, the September report is  somewhat unique in its own right : It’s the first major federal economic report released since the US government shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  September CPI, which was originally scheduled for release on October 15, is being belatedly published so that the government can meet deadlines to make cost of living adjustments for 2026 Social Security payments.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/uk-arson-attack-russia-sentencing-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00-12:30","title":"Drug dealer who organized Russia-linked arson attack in UK jailed for 17 years","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dylan Earl, a 21-year-old drug dealer from London, was jailed for 17 years for organizing a February 2024 arson attack on a Ukrainian-owned warehouse that delivered Starlink internet terminals to Ukraine.

who organized Russia-linked arson attack in UK jailed for 17 years \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:26 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ringleader of an  arson attack  on a Ukrainian-owned business in London last year was jailed for 17 years on Friday for what prosecutors called a “sustained campaign of terrorism and sabotage” on British soil.\n \n\n   \n  Dylan Earl, 21, pleaded guilty to aggravated arson over the February 2024 blaze that targeted a company delivering internet terminals from Elon Musk’s Starlink to Ukraine. He had also admitted an offense under the National Security Act, which was introduced in the wake of Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine to “tackle threats that fall short of traditional spying and espionage.”\n \n\n   \n  Jake Reeves, a 23-year-old accomplice of Earl’s, had also pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and a National Security Act charge. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Four others were convicted in July for their roles in the plot to burn down the warehouse on an industrial estate in east London on behalf of Wagner, a Russian mercenary group that has fought in Ukraine and is a proscribed terrorist organization in the UK.\n \n\n   \n   CNN reported from the trial  at London’s Old Bailey court this summer. Courtroom testimony and police evidence unveiled what experts said was a paradigmatic case of Russia’s “shadow” attacks on countries across Europe, in which Moscow has relied not on well-trained agents, but a network of low-level criminals: some sympathetic to Russia’s cause, others simply wanting payment.\n \n\n   \n  Whereas during the Cold War espionage and sabotage required painstaking recruitment and planning, these operations now just require a few hours on Telegram and some cash. Analysts told CNN this tactic is a dark spin on the modern “gig” economy, with hostile actors offering on-demand, no-strings-attached work to a flexible workforce.\n \n\n   \n  The sentencing of Earl and Reeves came after British police on Thursday arrested three men in their forties on suspicion of  spying for Russia . Dominic Murphy, head of the Counter-Terrorism Policing London, said his force was seeing an increasing number of “proxies” being recruited by foreign intelligence services. In September, three others were arrested on the  same charges .\n \n\n   \n  Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, Britain’s domestic intelligence service, warned last year that Russia was on a campaign “to generate mayhem on British and European streets.” Analysts have said the campaign has aimed to show Europe that there are costs to supporting Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  The alleged attacks have included blazes at a shopping mall in Poland and an Ikea store in Lithuania, cyberattacks on Czech railways, and the vandalism of Jewish buildings in France. Russia has denied involvement.\n \n\n   \n  Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s former foreign minister, said trying to thwart the campaign felt like playing whack-a-mole: “You catch one and Russia easily replaces them with several others hired through Telegram.”\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of exchanges on social media, reviewed by CNN during the trial, showed how this new “gig economy” for sabotage functions. Earl, a drug dealer, contacted a now-defunct Telegram account called “Privet Bot,” which prosecutors said was associated with Wagner and between 2023 and 2024 encouraged people to join operations across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Within days of contacting the account, Earl – whose correspondence revealed sympathy for Russia’s war – had been given his first target for an arson attack, the warehouse owned by a Ukrainian man. Reeves, having spoken with Earl, then recruited others to help carry out the attack.\n \n\n   \n  Nii Mensah was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment for his role in the attack; Jakeem Rose received eight; and Ugnius Asmena received seven. Ashton Evans, who was involved with Earl in another plot to set fire to a London restaurant and kidnap its owner, was sentenced to nine years in prison. That plot was foiled in April 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Frank Ferguson, head of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the prosecution “marks a pivotal moment in our national security efforts.”\n \n\n   \n  “This case demonstrates how vital the (National Security) Act is in protecting the UK from hostile state activity and ensuring those who seek to undermine our safety and security are held fully accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/royal-lodge-prince-andrew-gbr-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:20:00-04:00","title":"Everything we know about Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s 30-room mansion in Windsor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Royal Lodge, a 30-room royal residence in Windsor Great Park, has been home to Prince Andrew since 2003 under a 75-year lease granted by the Crown Estate.

  12:20 PM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the scandal surrounding Britain’s  Prince Andrew  continues to make headlines across the world, many are asking whether the disgraced royal will be able to continue living in Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003.\n \n\n   \n  But how much do we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years?\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property back in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, due to expire on June 15, 2078, he is expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There has been intense media speculation in recent days over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate both declined to comment over reports that he is in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/baseball-world-series-shohei-ohtani-conversation","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:57:00-04:00","title":"Was Shohei Ohtani’s NLCS Game 4 the greatest baseball performance ever?

performance ever? Who wins the World Series? A conversation \n       \n  By Harry Enten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Baseball fans continue to marvel at  Shohei Ohtani ’s performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series.\n \n\n   \n  He hit three home runs and pitched six innings of shutout ball. This left a lot of people wondering and flat out saying it was the greatest postseason effort of all time.\n \n\n   \n  But was it? I discussed that, Ohtani’s overall impact on baseball and the upcoming World Series with my old friend and sports expert Mr. Neil Paine. He runs his  own substack .\n \n\n   \n    Was that the best baseball performance ever?\n \n\n   \n   Harry Enten (HE) : I looked this up and Ohtani is the first pitcher ever to hit two, let alone three home runs in a postseason game. He is also only the 10th pitcher to go for at least six innings, giving up two hits, no runs and striking out at least 10. Is there anything I’m missing here?\n \n\n   \n  Neil Paine (NP): It’s interesting. Technically, there were probably games in history where someone added more total value with either the bat  or  the pitching arm than Ohtani did combined last week. For instance,  there’s a stat called Run Expectancy Added  that tracks how much a batter improved his team’s chances of scoring (or a pitcher reduced the opponent’s chances) – and in that stat, Ohtani graded as a +5.16 between his batting (+3.13) and pitching (2.03). There were  10 playoff games by batters  where someone added more value than Ohtani did overall, and  10 playoff games by pitchers  where they could say the same.\n \n\n   \n  And yet, there’s something about the “unicorn” nature of what Ohtani did that feels like it should get extra credit, beyond what the raw numbers say. None of those 10 batters were also pitching, or vice-versa, and to have one guy do both is almost completely unprecedented.  Babe Ruth ’s best combined Run Expectancy Added in a playoff game that he also pitched was just +4.01.\n \n\n   \n  It’s almost one of those definitional things where, if this is Ohtani’s greatest combined batting/pitching game ever –  and it was , by Run Expectancy – it must also be the best combined game by anybody because he’s the only guy who’s ever really even tried this kind of thing (at least among modern players).\n \n\n   \n   HE : I love the advanced stats there because it does put it all together. You make a fairly convincing case that it wasn’t the “greatest”… but it makes me think we’re looking at the wrong words here.\n \n\n   \n  The right word is historic. Ohtani literally made history. It is one of a kind –i.e. truly unique – even if it wasn’t the greatest.\n \n\n   \n   NP : Or what I really like is what my fellow Substacker (and your fellow Ivy grad)  Doug Glanville  has called what Shohei tends to do: “ Ohtanic .” It’s a special sort of thing that not only hasn’t been done before, but also up until about a decade ago, we didn’t even think was  possible  in the game anymore.\n \n\n   \n    Is Ohtani the best ever?\n \n\n   \n   HE : This I think is part of the Ohtani playbook overall. I saw people online making the statement that Ohtani is the greatest ever or best ever.\n \n\n   \n  But anyone can look it up and see there have been people who have done better. There are people who have hit more home runs, for example. There have been people who have higher  wins above replacement  (or WAR, an advanced statistic that seeks to measure a player’s overall contribution).\n \n\n   \n  But then you look at players who pitched at least 5% of the time. Only Ohtani and Ruth have hit 100 or more home runs. Ohtani has hit nearly 300 homers and has plenty of career left.\n \n\n   \n  He is truly one of a kind for players in the last 90 years.\n \n\n   \n   NP : Well, I wanna push back on one thing you said: “Anyone can look it up.” It’s actually surprisingly difficult to find the combined Run Expectancy stats I mentioned above, for instance. And only in the past few years did FanGraphs even add  a combined WAR leaderboard , pretty much in response to Ohtani’s existence.\n \n\n   \n  I think that really gets to the one-of-a-kind angle as much as anything else – when these statistical sites or historical resources were set up during the 21st century, it had been so long since there was a truly viable batter/pitcher hybrid like this that they didn’t even think they would need to mash together players’ stats across both activities. Ohtani broke how we do seemingly simple stat lookups with these feats that are so outside the bounds of what is usually considered “normal” for the purposes of reporting on the game.\n \n\n   \n    Ohtani is dragging eyes from overseas to the US game\n \n\n   \n   HE : That might be the gentlest pushback in history, ha ha. You know I read what you write here, and it really gets to how Ohtani breaks the traditional metrics. He’s forcing us to think about baseball differently.\n \n\n   \n  You know I’ve written a number of pieces in the past about how baseball viewership is  way down from its heights  – even if they are up a little bit this year.\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani makes those comparisons somewhat useless. Why? He’s bringing in so many international viewers. Specifically, those from Japan. More people in Japan tuned into this season’s  Tokyo Series  starring the (Los Angeles) Dodgers than Americans did to last year’s World Series.\n \n\n   \n  Baseball nearly doubled its viewership of last year’s World Series thanks to Japan, even as those games were playing in the morning in Tokyo.\n \n\n   \n   NP : The Dodgers have truly become Japan’s team in recent years, and Ohtani is unsurprisingly right in the middle of that. He gave them the  most valuable Japanese hitter  in the league by WAR, and the team also had the  most valuable Japanese pitcher  in Yoshinobu Yamamoto – plus two more positive-value pitchers in the form of Roki Sasaki and Ohtani himself.\n \n\n   \n  Every time a great player gets posted from NPB (Japan’s version of MLB), the Dodgers are either the frontrunners to sign him or at least on the very short list of candidates, in part because of the talent pipeline they’ve already built in LA.\n \n\n   \n  And then that builds a virtuous cycle where the Dodgers get a ton of attention from fans in Japan, and when they do well, it makes them a more appealing destination for the next generation of players coming over, and so forth.\n \n\n   \n  We used to associate the (Seattle) Mariners and (New York) Yankees with acquiring Japanese stars as well – think of  Ichiro (Suzuki)  and Hideki Matsui, for instance – but the Dodgers were always the original destination  going back to Hideo Nomo , and they’ve re-asserted themselves in that regard again, to the benefit of their brand and MLB’s as a whole.\n \n\n   \n   HE : Again, this is a situation where Ohtani is just unique. Yes, those guys were big in Japan, but Ohtani is just different. Moreover, the way baseball has capitalized on him is different too.\n \n\n   \n    Who wins the World Series?\n \n\n   \n   HE : And thanks to that, we’re now onto a World Series that truly feels more “World” than ever before. We got the popularity of the game in Japan and the Toronto Blue Jays are involved.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, there can only be one winner. The prediction markets have the Dodgers as more than a 2:1 favorite over the team whose flag flies north of the border. What do you say?\n \n\n   \n   NP : I’m just old enough to remember  when they made a big deal about  the Blue Jays facing the Atlanta Braves in 1992 as the first true, international “World” Series. Look at how far we’ve come!\n \n\n   \n  But yeah, the Dodgers are fairly heavy favorites, and it’s hard to argue against that after what they did to the Milwaukee Brewers – who had  the best record in baseball  during the regular season – in what was a very lopsided, brutal  NLCS sweep .\n \n\n   \n  The things that I think point to  Toronto having a chance  are that the Dodgers’ starters pitched out of their  minds  during that series: they had literally the best rotation ERA (0.63) ever in a League Championship Series. That may not be able to be repeated for a second straight series, though they are coming off a  near-record amount of rest  heading into the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays are also much better offensively than Milwaukee – they’re averaging 6.5 RPG in the postseason with  Vladimir Guerrero Jr.  carrying a 1.440 OPS. And then, if you get to the Dodger bullpen, you’re facing a group that was outside the top 20 in WAR during the regular season.\n \n\n   \n  But the thing that makes the Dodgers so dangerous is just how many players they have who can hurt you. If it’s not Ohtani – and it’s worth pointing out that, despite the mammoth Game 4 we talked about earlier, he was hitting below .200 in the NLCS beforehand, yet they were still dominating – it might be Freddie Freeman, or Mookie Betts, or a bunch of guys – like Tommy Edman, Teoscar Hernández, Max Muncy and Kiké Hernández – who always seem to be coming up with the clutch hit.\n \n\n   \n  That, as much as anything else, will be what determines the series – whether Toronto’s pitching can match what LA’s aces do and give themselves a chance to win. But to me, the Dodgers are just too overwhelming. I think they win it in 5.\n \n\n   \n   HE : There you have it… It’s Dodgers in 5… I think Neil’s probably right. Unless, the Blue Jays win. In that case, I disagree with my old pal. Thanks, Neil!\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/louvre-heist-lift-maker-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-04:00","title":"Louvre heist lift-maker capitalizes on product’s notoriety with cheeky Instagram ad","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves used a Böcker Agilo lift to breach the museum’s eastern balcony, the German company Böcker has turned the incident into a viral social media campaign through a cheeky Instagram post.

He was living in New York City and working at a nonprofit when the city was devastated by  Superstorm Sandy  in 2012. Stuck in his small Queens apartment, the self-described “news junkie” spent long stretches online, falling into internet wormholes.\n \n\n   \n  At some point, he says, he came across the  Westboro Baptist Church  (WBC).\n \n\n   \n  The Church, which is considered a hate group by the  Southern Poverty Law Center , is best known for organizing pickets at soldiers’ funerals and emblazoning anti-LGBT slogans on protest signs and billboards.\n \n\n   \n  “The first thing I saw was that (the church) was in a neighborhood. I was walking around and I decided to do a 360 view and I saw a ‘for sale’ sign in front of the house on Google Earth. I thought it would be really funny to buy that house.”\n \n\n   \n  Although that specific house in Topeka, Kansas, was no longer for sale when Jackson inquired, another one on the street was. Jackson bought it sight unseen. Despite never having been there, he was ready for a change, so he moved to his new digs in Topeka, the state capital.\n \n\n   \n  But becoming the WBC’s neighbor was only the first step in his plan.\n \n\n   \n  Next, he painted the house’s exterior in rainbow stripes to make it look like a Pride flag. The act was intentional, agitprop for the social media age. It was a response to the the church’s anti-gay rhetoric, and it was right in front of their living room windows, impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  He named it the Equality House.\n \n\n   \n  Photos of the home went viral, but Jackson thought people would see a picture, have a laugh, and then move on.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, they showed up to visit.\n \n\n   \n  Although Topeka has a population of about 125,000 people, its location along I-70, a major highway that cuts east-west across the US, makes it a convenient stop along road trips. The Westboro Baptist Church, and the Equality House, are just off the highway.\n \n\n   \n  A few years later, Jackson bought a second home on the street and painted it in pink, white and blue stripes to resemble the  trans pride flag .\n \n\n   \n  Jackson doesn’t call the Equality House a “spite” house, but he knows that a lot of people disagree. The house is part of a wider nonprofit he’s established called  Planting Peace,  which has launched other initiatives including orphanages and elephant rescue efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “The Equality House is a symbol of compassion, peace, and positive change,” the organization’s website says. But its location, facing the infamous church, makes a case for its “spite” house label.\n \n\n   \n    Hostile designs\n \n\n   \n  Spite architecture has a short but vivid history, most of it American.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sometimes mistakenly linked to “nail” houses, where owners refuse to sell to developers, leaving a single structure marooned amid new constructions. Sometimes owners are holding out for a bigger payday. Others stay put out of stubbornness — think of the little house at the  beginning of the movie “Up.” \n \n\n   \n  But spite houses are different. They’re built not to resist developers but, as their name suggests, they’re intentionally designed, with a degree of malice, to annoy someone specific.\n \n\n   \n  Boston’s “ Skinny House ” may be the most famous example.\n \n\n   \n  Ten feet wide and four stories tall, it rises from the city’s historic North End. According to a real estate agent who once sold it, two brothers owned the plot. One built a grand home for himself while the other was away fighting in the Civil War. When the soldier returned, furious that his brother had left him a smaller portion of the plot, he built a narrow tower to block the mansion’s view and sunlight.\n \n\n   \n  Today, a plaque outside the diminutive 44 Hull Street property reads “Skinny House,” with “Spite House” in parentheses. Although it’s still a private residence, it has become a tourist attraction in the tony Boston neighborhood, which also contains the Old North Church, the city’s oldest, and a statue of Paul Revere.\n \n\n   \n  On Google Maps, it’s labeled “Boston spite house.” Instagram is full of photos of tourists visiting the house, with “stretching my arms out between this house and the one next door” by far the most popular pose.\n \n\n   \n  Spite is one thing. Prime location is another. Despite its dimensions and the regular parade of visitors outside, the home  sold for $1.25 million  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  While spite houses aren’t an exclusively American phenomenon, they do flourish in the United States. The mix of private-property culture, individualism, and the country’s fragmented zoning laws creates ideal conditions for personal grudges to solidify into real estate.\n \n\n   \n  “Hostile architecture is very American,” says Paavo Monkkonen, assistant professor in the University of California, Los Angeles’ Department of Urban Planning. “Your house represents more here than it does in other countries. It’s a more personal symbol because it’s a home ownership society. There’s more neighbor-to-neighbor conflict.”\n \n\n   \n  Spite houses are a kind of hostile architecture, but usually on a local scale —built for the irritation of a particular person or family. Broader “hostile architecture” includes things like uncomfortable park benches meant to keep homeless people from sleeping on them.\n \n\n   \n  “The US approach to urban design is often not people-centric,” says Monkkonen. “In the sense that in certain parts of the city you want to build things that no one will go to, plazas that will be empty, because you want to protect your own peace and quiet.”\n \n\n   \n  There are spite houses outside of the US, too.\n \n\n   \n  Sarajevo’s Inat Kuća, or House of Resentment, offers a Balkan version of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1800s, Austro-Hungarian authorities wanted to demolish homes alongside the Miljacka River to make room for a new city hall. One homeowner refused to sell. The eventual compromise saw the government move his house, brick-by-brick, and rebuild it in the opposite river bank.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the structure is home to a traditional Bosnian restaurant, but to locals it will always be the House of Spite or House of Contempt – a moment of David defeating Goliath, and a symbol of Bosnian pride.\n \n\n   \n  And it doesn’t have to be a full-on house of spite to get visitors interested in stopping by.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City’s West Village, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the United States, a small, easily missed corner of pavement has become an unlikely tourist attraction.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t just any old piece of Manhattan asphalt.\n \n\n   \n  The 500-square-inch triangle carries an all-caps message: “PROPERTY OF THE HESS ESTATE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DEDICATED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.”\n \n\n   \n  Officially, it’s called the Hess Triangle. Unofficially, it’s the “spite triangle.”\n \n\n   \n  Its existence began as a beef between the Hess family — German immigrants who owned large plots of land in this part of Manhattan — and the city, which seized most of their land in the early 1900s to build the subway.\n \n\n   \n  When a survey showed the city’s measurements of the land were slightly off, the family refused to surrender the remaining two-foot sliver. Instead they tiled their protest into the ground.\n \n\n   \n  The appearance of the spite triangle made headlines in July 1922, with the New York Times giving it an aptly  small amount of newspaper real estate  .\n \n\n   \n  For Aaron Jackson’s Equality House project, going viral had pros and cons. He was happy that the wave of attention got people to learn about Westboro Baptist Church and educate themselves on LGBT issues.\n \n\n   \n  However, it got to the point that he no longer wanted to live in the house day-to-day. Instead, Jackson is   converting the home into a museum and library so that people who visit can do more than just take a picture.\n \n\n   \n  Some guests, Jackson says, want to show support when they visit the Equality House. Others want to argue. Some consider it a spite house, while others think it’s an activist experiment.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day,” says Jackson, “it’s an art project. I don’t tell people how to feel.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/business/analysis-trump-sanctions-russian-war-machine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:29:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,’ but the real test is enforcement","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant policy shift, the Trump administration announced new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, marking the first direct sanctions since returning to office.

October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  After nine months of attempting to coax Russia into concessions using only incentives – whether by holding talks on repairing diplomatic relations or hosting a major bilateral summit on US soil – the Trump administration in an unexpected reversal announced “ massive sanctions ” Wednesday on Moscow’s two biggest oil producers.\n \n\n   \n  Just one week earlier, President Donald Trump had backed away from supplying long-range  Tomahawk missiles  to Ukraine after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who secured an invitation to a second bilateral summit, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among the more hawkish members of Trump’s Cabinet regarding  Ukraine , was tasked with preparing that summit. But Russia’s uncompromising insistence on addressing what it sees as the “root causes” of the conflict finally hit home at the White House. Trump didn’t want to “waste time” at another summit, he said Wednesday, though he left the door open, suggesting that “we’ll do it in the future.”\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent Russia’s war machine?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s frustration with Russia had clearly been growing in recent months, as it became clear that his much-touted Alaska summit had failed to stop escalating violence in Ukraine. He even shifted his position on Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia, increasing intelligence sharing to help Kyiv target military and energy facilities,  sources told CNN  last week.\n \n\n   \n  And yet after multiple threats from Trump to ramp up sanctions against Moscow failed to materialize, and with the call between the two presidents last week suggesting the US leader was still susceptible to Russian persuasion, Wednesday’s move to sanction the Russian oil giants and their subsidiaries blindsided experts.\n \n\n   \n  “It was actually surprising simply because there was always a discrepancy between Trump’s rhetoric and actions,” said Maria Shagina, a senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), in written comments to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems that today Russia has overplayed its hand, and Trump’s patience is wearing thin,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How painful this will be for Russia is something that experts and energy markets are still trying to decipher.\n \n\n   \n    What exactly are the sanctions?\n \n\n   \n  This is the first time Trump has imposed direct sanctions on Russia since he returned to office in January, though in August, his administration declared punishing secondary tariffs on India for its purchases of Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions are typical in the sense that the companies listed – Rosneft and Lukoil, along with dozens of subsidiaries – will have their assets frozen in the United States, and US entities will be banned from doing business with them. Yet most experts agree that targeting Rosneft and Lukoil represents a significant change. Together, the two companies account for about half of Russian oil exports, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the Biden administration went after Russia’s third- and fourth-largest oil companies, Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegaz, in its final package of sanctions. But it left the biggest ones alone, experts say, over fears of triggering global supply disruptions that would lead to higher oil prices.\n \n\n   \n  In a note Wednesday night, Helima Croft, head of Commodities Strategy at RBC, called Trump’s sanctions “the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM.”\n \n\n   \n    What else is the West doing?\n \n\n   \n  Another first for Trump’s second term here is the appearance (whether by accident or design) of coordinating sanctions with NATO allies, which had been normal practice under the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  A week earlier, on October 15, the United Kingdom expanded its sanctions to include Rosneft and Lukoil, and on Wednesday, the European Union also unanimously approved its 19th package of sanctions. That package includes a full transaction ban on Rosneft. And while it stops short of targeting Lukoil, it goes after Litasco, a trading unit of Lukoil in the United Arab Emirates that the European Union describes as “Lukoil’s prominent shadow fleet enabler.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,” wrote European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who also held a call Wednesday with the US treasury secretary.\n \n\n   \n    How big a blow is this to Russia?\n \n\n   \n  The impact that the new US sanctions could have on the Russian economy is up for debate. Shagina, the IISS senior fellow, points out that the move comes at a “vulnerable point” for Moscow, which faces the double whammy of Western sanctions and what she calls Ukrainian “physical sanctions” with its ongoing drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Those attacks have already contributed to a 20% drop in Russia’s energy revenues so far this year, though Moscow is planning to make up some of the shortfall through tax increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a strong signal, but it’s still more of a signal than a huge blow to the Russian economy,” said Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin. He points out there has been little to no effect so far on the ruble and that the stocks of Lukoil and Rosneft have fallen but “not cratered.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts largely expect that while there may be temporary supply disruptions, Russia will find ways to keep its oil – including that produced by Lukoil and Rosneft – flowing onto global markets.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” said Ajay Parmar, director of oil markets and energy transition at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based commodities data and analytics firm. He said he believes that the Russians will simply make “adjustments” and create new workarounds.\n \n\n   \n  The lasting impact will depend on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds as they arise, said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitical analysis at Energy Aspects, a data and intelligence firm in London\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not clear yet that the Trump administration, even if it doesn’t get what it wants from Putin, is going to have the resolve and the desire to go down that road,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Will this dent the global economy?\n \n\n   \n  The big question for both Russia and the global economy, experts say, is how India will respond to these new US sanctions. Citing industry sources, Reuters reported Thursday that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest importer of Russian crude oil, is planning to cut back or stop imports completely, going even further than the letter of the sanctions as US pressure mounts on New Delhi to stop importing Russian oil as a condition for tariff reduction.\n \n\n   \n  For Russia, this would be critical.  India imports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels of Russian crude per day, Parmar estimates, accounting for about 30-40% of all Russian exports.  If those imports were to suddenly stop, “that would leave only China as the big buyer of Russian oil,” he told CNN. “I think it’s unlikely that China would buy all of that lost oil, so some of it may be taken off the market, and that is really the bigger driver for higher oil prices right now,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile multiple trade sources told Reuters Thursday that Chinese state oil majors have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil in the wake of the US sanctions – a move that would further strain Moscow’s oil revenues.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese national oil companies PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC and Zhenhua Oil will stop dealing in seaborne Russian oil, at least in the short-term, the sources told the agency.\n \n\n   \n  US crude oil prices are down almost 25% from their peak in January, a drop that gave Trump “more room now to impose sanctions,” Kluge pointed out. But the challenge will be avoiding sustained price rises that could hand an unexpected windfall to Moscow and partially offset the impact of sanctions, he said. That would likely mean Trump putting further pressure on OPEC+ to boost oil production, said Parmar. If Trump is successful, price rises could be contained.\n \n\n   \n    Will it bring Putin back to the table?\n \n\n   \n  On their own, these sanctions are nowhere near enough to spark a course correction in Moscow, experts agree. And yet they could signal more difficult times ahead for the Kremlin.\n \n\n   \n  The response from Putin, coming almost 24 hours after the US sanctions announcement, was somewhat contradictory.\n \n\n   \n  The sanctions “will not significantly affect our economic well-being,” he told a group of Russian reporters. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The ultimate economic impact of these new sanctions on Russia is yet to be determined but the political shift is alarming for Moscow, said Kluge, of the German think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, it could be different tomorrow again,” he said referring to Trump’s approach to Russia.\n \n\n   \n  But “it’s a signal that the previous mode of dealing with Russia in which there was always another chance … another extension to the ultimatum … has actually ended.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/baseball-mlb-vladimir-guerrero-world-series-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"09:02:00-04:00","title":"From homegrown to home runs, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is the Toronto Blue Jays’ postseason hero heading into the Fall Classic","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Toronto Blue Jays’ first baseman and a 26-year-old MLB star, has led his team to its first World Series appearance since 1993 by delivering an extraordinary postseason performance with a .442 batting average, six home runs, and 12 RBIs, earning ALCS MVP honors after defeating the Seattle Mariners.

As a child, he was a  regular  at the ballpark, often accompanying his dad on the field before games.\n \n\n   \n  “And from the time I was very young, I remember always imitating what my dad did on the field,” Guerrero Jr. wrote for  The Players Tribune. \n \n\n   \n  The younger Guerrero detailed that he watched his father and tried to emulate him, even picking up on gameday routines.\n \n\n   \n  “He taped his feet before games … so I taped my feet before games.\n \n\n   \n  “He didn’t wear batting gloves … so I didn’t wear batting gloves.\n \n\n   \n  “He stood a certain way in the batter’s box … so I took the same stance,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But now the roles are reversed, with his father watching on as the younger Guerrero adds to the family legacy and continues to light up the diamond.\n \n\n   \n  After his son was crowned ALCS MVP in a series where he went yard three times, the older Guerrero showed his support in an  Instagram post  that read: “I’ve seen every sacrifice, every workout, every tear. Watching him become the ALCS MVP is the reward for all of it. You’re great son!”\n \n\n   \n  Despite all of his accolades, Guerrero Sr. never won a World Series, with his closest attempt coming as a designated hitter when he and the Rangers lost the 2010 Fall Classic in five games to the San Francisco Giants. He left MLB the following season to join the Dominican Major League.\n \n\n   \n  “My personal goal is to win a World Series and give the ring to my dad,” Guerrero Jr. said in an interview with  Fox Sports  before the Blue Jays had clinched a World Series berth.\n \n\n   \n  That goal is now within reach after Toronto booked its place in the best-of-seven World Series   against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Game 1 set for Friday in Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “It means a lot,” Guerrero Jr. told  CNN Sports ’ Andy Scholes on media day.\n \n\n   \n  “I was not even born when when (the Blue Jays) were in the World Series, you know, but to me, it’s like bring bringing back and trying to win it all is something I always dream with.\n \n\n   \n  “I know everybody here is gonna be 100% to trying to win it all.”\n \n\n   \n  Blue Jays fans across Canada will hold their faith in Guerrero Jr. when he takes to the field, and that’s something the Dominican-Canadian feels when he’s out there.\n \n\n   \n  “They are the best fans ever,” he said speaking to reporters on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “They always bring the energy. They are always there for us. It doesn’t matter if we’re losing by a lot, they cheer for you and that’s for me why they’re the best ever.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/basketball-nba-thunder-pacers-sga-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"08:24:00-04:00","title":"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drops 55 in second straight double OT win as OKC Thunder outlast Indiana Pacers in NBA Finals rematch","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander delivered a career-high 55-point performance in a dramatic double-overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers, marking Oklahoma City's first two games of the season with overtime wins.

Finals rematch \n       \n  By Frank Nunns O'Connell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:24 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander poured in a career-high 55 points as the Thunder outlasted the Indiana Pacers 141-135 on Thursday in what was Oklahoma City’s second straight double-overtime victory to begin the season.\n \n\n   \n  In a rematch of last season’s NBA Finals – which went the full seven games – the two squads proved again that there was little to separate them as neither led by more than  seven points  in the 58-minute affair.\n \n\n   \n  Although the reigning MVP blew up on the night, he was supported by Aaron Wiggins’ 23 points and nine rebounds and Ajay Mitchell’s  career-best  26 points off the bench for the Thunder – who were missing key players such as Jalen Williams, Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe and Alex Caruso.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Tyrese Haliburton-less Pacers were led by Bennedict Mathurin and Pascal Siakam, who each had a double-double and combined for 68 points in what was Indiana’s opening game of the NBA season.\n \n\n   \n  And it was Siakam who came up clutch at the end of regulation. With seven seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and the Thunder leading 113-111, the Cameroonian forward stepped back over Oklahoma City center Chet Holmgren to sink a high-arching, 22-foot jumper that sparked a roar from the Indiana crowd. Gilgeous-Alexander then missed a pull-up triple, sending the game to OT.\n \n\n   \n  The opening overtime period gave SGA the chance to prove why he is the reigning MVP, sinking a clutch step back jumper to give the Thunder a two-point lead with 26.4 remaining and briefly silence the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n \n\n   \n  But the Pacers rallied again, this time behind the silky touch of Mathurin. The fourth-year guard faked his way past his fellow Canadian Gilgeous-Alexander and stepped through to lay in his 36th point of the game, tying the affair at 124-124 with 0:13 remaining.\n \n\n   \n  And after Gilgeous-Alexander was once again wide of the mark on another attempted game winner, OKC was once again set for double OT.\n \n\n   \n  Controversy then struck with under 30 seconds left.\n \n\n   \n  With the Thunder leading 139-135 with 22.1 seconds remaining in the game, it appeared Pacers forward Obi Toppin had stolen an errant inbound pass, but the officials conceded a timeout called by the OKC bench, much to the anger of Indiana head coach Rick Carlisle.\n \n\n   \n  The Thunder – who became the first team in NBA history to begin a season with double overtimes in their first two games – then sealed the victory when Gilgeous-Alexander was fouled and sunk the ensuing free throws to make it 141-135.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Carlisle was apoplectic,  telling reporters : “I’m not talking about the refs. If I talk about the refs, I will be fined an exorbitant amount of money.”\n \n\n   \n  “They just kept marching to the free throw line,” he said regarding the Thunder’s ability to get to the line. “When that happens it takes the pace out of the game. It becomes difficult to get shots.\n \n\n   \n  “They shot 51 free throws. That’s at least 25 times where we’re unable to get any tempo going because we’re standing there and they’re setting their defense up. They did some good things to get to the line, but I’m not going to talk about the refs.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m tired, but it’s expected,” Gilgeous-Alexander said, speaking to  reporters post-game .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a good way to break the ice on the season, shake the rust off, kind of bust the lungs up, get my cardio back.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not ideal, four extra overtimes in two games, but we’ll take two W’s.”\n \n\n   \n    Warriors beat Nuggets, despite Gordon’s 50\n \n\n   \n  Also on Thursday, the Golden State Warriors got an OT win of their own as they beat the Denver Nuggets 137-131 behind Steph Curry’s 42 points.\n \n\n   \n  The four-time NBA champion – who also had six rebounds, seven assists, three steals and a block – scored 35 points in the second half and OT to take the Warriors to 2-0 on the season.\n \n\n   \n  Curry’s heroics beat back an immense 50-point game from Denver’s Aaron Gordon, who tied a record set by  Terry Rozier  in 2020 for the most threes in a season opener by  making 10 triples .\n \n\n   \n  “It sucks,” Gordon said, according to the  Associated Press .\n \n\n   \n  “They were asking if I wanted the game ball. No. I don’t want to take the L with me. It sucks. But it’s one game.

upended decades of futility to become college football’s most unlikely rising power \n       \n  By Dana O'Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Galen Clavio walked into the student mailroom – back when student mailrooms were still a thing – and found an envelope stuffed in his mailbox. Inside were six tickets for each of that season’s Indiana University  football  games, free to him as a dorm resident because, to put it bluntly, no one was terribly interested in going to Hoosier football games, let alone paying for them.\n \n\n   \n  It was 1997 and the Hoosiers were terrible. Not that being terrible was unusual. For the better part of its 138-year existence, Indiana football has excelled at being awful.\n \n\n   \n  It owned the record for most losses in  Division I  history (713) and the worst winning percentage in Big Ten history (.421). Prior to last year, only 14 teams in school history had earned a trip to a bowl game and of the then-30 coaches to lead the program, only five left with winning records – just three since the turn of the 20th century and only one, Bo McMillan, since the end of World War II.\n \n\n   \n  In 1976, Lee Corso, who coached the Hoosiers from 1973 to 1982, memorably stopped a game against Ohio State to snap a picture of his entire team under the scoreboard. The Hoosiers had just scored and led the Buckeyes 7-6 – the first lead Indiana held over Ohio State in a quarter century.\n \n\n   \n  “I looked it up. Can you believe it? Twenty-five years! The goal of a lifetime,’’ Corso said after the game, explaining his rationale. Ohio State went on to win the game, 47-7.\n \n\n   \n  Suffice to say, Indiana football was not an afterthought in the state. That would require it to be a thought in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  “Being an Indiana football fan felt like being in a very small club that no one wanted to join,’’ Clavio, who is now the associate dean for undergraduate education at the IU Media School and director of the university’s sports media program, told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  This is basketball country, a reality proudly declared at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame – “in 49 other states, it’s just basketball, but this is Indiana,’’ – which is located in New Castle, home also to the largest high school gym in the world (capacity 9,325) and the Steve Alford All-American Inn, where a gigantic sneaker sits out front of the hotel named after the beloved IU hoopster.\n \n\n   \n  This is where 41,000 people came to watch high school star Damon Bailey play in his state championship game and where, if you ask people about the Wat Shot – Christian Watford’s 2011 buzzer-beating three-pointer against rival Kentucky – they not only know what it is; they know where they were when the ball went in.\n \n\n   \n  “Hoosiers,” remember, might be a nickname for all IU athletes, but in the movie, they measured the height of a basket, not the length of the football field.\n \n\n   \n  As a fourth-generation Hoosier, Clavio was reared on all of this, but his father also was a freshman during IU’s football glory year (singular), back in 1967 when Indiana went to the Rose Bowl (and, for what it’s worth, lost to USC). He regularly took his son to football games, largely because the tickets were cheaper and easier to get than they were for hoops games.\n \n\n   \n  So, as misery-inducing as it was, Clavio regularly attended the football games as an undergrad and long after. When he started working at IU in 2009, he started a podcast, the “ CrimsonCast ,” in which he dissects both football and basketball. Maybe 1,000 listeners tuned in for the fall Sunday postmortems.\n \n\n   \n  Last weekend, after the Hoosiers rocked Michigan State and rose to No. 2 in the Associated Press polls, more than 12,000 people tuned in to Clavio’s podcast. The Hoosiers are a hot topic and more a ridiculously happy one, having won more games (18) in the last season and a half than they amassed in the previous three years combined. After turning its own history on its ear by earning a spot in  the College Football Playoff last year , Indiana is now one of just six undefeated teams left and that No. 2 ranking in the AP poll is a new program best.\n \n\n   \n  The once forlorn small club of football faithful have welcomed a convoy of bandwagon hoppers. This Saturday’s noon ET game against UCLA will mark the eighth consecutive sellout for IU. After the allotted 11,000 student tickets sold out for the first time, athletic director Scott Dolson made more available.\n \n\n   \n  They weren’t free.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Google me’\n \n\n   \n  What is happening at Indiana is not normal, not ever, but certainly not in the revenue-rich era of college football.\n \n\n   \n  To the spenders go the spoils, and while IU as an athletic department wasn’t low rent, it was not keeping up with its peers. According to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database, IU regularly trailed its Big Ten brethren in annual football spending, $12 million shy of the median in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  With the help of deep-pocketed donors, the university has slowly opened its wallet. Two years ago, it finally crafted a football-only weight room and added new suites and this year put down new turf in the stadium. The result: $61.6 million spending in 2024 (a number partially offset by the $15 million owed to former head coach Tom Allen), on par with the rest of the Big Ten.\n \n\n   \n  But if football success was predicated on spending money alone, the Texas Longhorns would never lose a game. For the better part of its existence, Indiana football largely followed the playbook when it came to head coaching hires, either recycling former head coaches who’d been fired (Gerry DiNardo, Sam Wyche) or targeting assistants from other big-name programs (Tom Allen, Kevin Wilson).\n \n\n   \n  In December 2023, after dismissing Tom Allen, Dolson opted to go in another direction, bringing in a wildly successful head coach who made up for what he lacked in name recognition with a history of winning.\n \n\n   \n  Adding in his time at Indiana, Curt Cignetti is 137-37 as a head coach, a pattern of sustained success that ought to merit attention. Except his resume included stops at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, a Division II school; Elon, an FCS school; and James Madison (JMU), which only jumped to the FBS level in 2022. While moving from low- to mid- to high-major is a normal process in college basketball, it’s not regularly done in football.\n \n\n   \n  Fair or not, Indiana was, frankly, the only sort of job the 62-year-old Cignetti was going to get.\n \n\n   \n  In truth when, at a news conference, he provided his now legendary answer to a question about selling his vision to recruits – “It’s pretty simple. I win. Google me.’’ – he was being equal parts badass and honest. People did, in fact, have to Google him.\n \n\n   \n  Dolson did not.\n \n\n   \n    Indiana gets rolling under Cignetti\n \n\n   \n  Dolson grew up in Michigan City, Indiana, closer in proximity to Michigan, Michigan State and Northwestern, but his heart always bled Hoosier red.\n \n\n   \n  At the age of 9, Dolson attended a Bob Knight basketball camp, dreaming of finding a way to join the team. Smart enough to know he couldn’t play for the Hoosiers, he turned his attention to serving as a student manager as an undergrad. In 1987, when Knight and the aforementioned Alford combined to take Indiana to a national title, Dolson was a junior.\n \n\n   \n  The year after he graduated, he joined the athletic department as a part of the Varsity Club and essentially never left.\n \n\n   \n  That long history with the school means he knew well the historic pigskin ineptitude he was battling when, in 2020, he succeeded Fred Glass as AD.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had our ups and downs, and unfortunately a lot more downs,’’ Dolson told CNN Sports. “We always were trying to find consistency and never could.’’\n \n\n   \n  Dolson decided to not merely search for consistency; he opted to research it. He commissioned an in-house study to examine what did and didn’t work at Indiana, as well as consider how other schools with similarly strong basketball histories – Kentucky, Kansas and Duke – had at least made some inroads in football. He looked at everything from budgeting to scheduling to facilities.\n \n\n   \n  He also formed a profile for the sort of coach he needed to succeed. At the top of the list: Someone with successful head-coaching experience. A strong recruiter and smart offensive mind who could develop quarterbacks also mattered, as did a person who appreciated continuity in his staffing.\n \n\n   \n  When Dolson interviewed Cignetti, he found himself mentally ticking off the boxes on his wish list.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti was not blind to what he was walking into. Upon stepping off the plane for his introductory press conference, he sensed the sort of Eeyore gloom pervading Indiana football. It was worse than disappointment; it was disinterest.\n \n\n   \n  So when he was introduced at halftime during a basketball game that day, he hit the Hoosier faithful square in the eyes, finishing his remarks with a literal mic drop by shouting, “Purdue sucks. But so does Michigan and Ohio State. Go IU!”\n \n\n   \n    From unknown to untouchable\n \n\n   \n  The energy and bluster helped but rare is the coach who doesn’t come in promising to win big.\n \n\n   \n  What separated Cignetti was he had a plan to do it.\n \n\n   \n  Often lost in the pursuit of the next head coach is just how hard it is to  be  a head coach. Cignetti has held the job title since 2011. Despite the laundry list of things to do at Indiana, he was not intimidated. He was not confused about what he wanted, or what his team’s identity would be.\n \n\n   \n  Within days of signing his contract, Cignetti reached out to the staff under Allen and asked them to evaluate each of the returning players so that, when he arrived on campus, he could start making decisions. By the end of week one, a stunned Dolson told his wife Heidi, “This thing is already rolling.”\n \n\n   \n  “When you take over a program, but especially football because it’s so big, it can be overwhelming,’’ Dolson said. “Like where do you start? He knew what he wanted, and how he was going to do it from day one. It was, ‘This is what we’re going to do, how we’re going to do it, and we’re not tolerating anything else.’’’\n \n\n   \n  In a way, Cignetti built the Indiana roster in his own image – on the backs of players hungry to prove their worth.\n \n\n   \n  His starting quarterback in 2024, Kurtis Rourke, came from the Group of 5 Mid-American Conference (MAC) member Ohio University, and threw for 3,000 yards and 29 touchdowns. Lead running back Justice Ellison came from underwhelming Wake Forest, and rushed for more than 800 yards. Top receiver Elijah Sarratt followed his coach from James Madison and hauled in 53 catches for 957 yards. Linebacker Aiden Fisher also came from JMU. He led the defense with 118 tackles.\n \n\n   \n  He’s followed the same formula this year. Running back Kaelon Black, another James Madison transfer, leads the team with 439 yards on the ground and Sarratt is back atop the receivers, with nine TDs and 603 yards receiving.\n \n\n   \n  And then there is this year’s quarterback. A coveted player at the time of his transfer from Cal, Fernando Mendoza does not come to his Heisman-contending season via a gilded path. A former three-star recruit out of Miami and the grandson of Cuban immigrants, he initially signed with non-scholarship Yale before getting a late bite from Cal. He grew into his greatness.\n \n\n   \n  It’s all put Indiana into a rather unique pickle. Instead of searching for his next coach, Dolson had to make sure he could hang on to the one he had.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti’s success coupled with IU’s lack of tradition ordinarily would make the coach ripe for the picking from other bigger, more established programs. Dolson stopped the rumor mill before it started to churn, offering his coach a new  eight-year, $93 million deal  last week.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a nice salary jump for a man who was making $670,000 two years ago at James Madison.\n \n\n   \n  Cignetti rewarded himself by buying some new furniture, though he kept a 36-year-old, well-worn Bradington Young recliner, despite protests from his wife, Manette. “It’s untouchable,’’ Cignetti told the Big Ten Network.\n \n\n   \n  Now, so is the coach.\n \n\n   \n    Energy, belief and hope\n \n\n   \n  The schedule breaks favorably going forward. Of Indiana’s remaining five opponents, UCLA is the only team with a winning record in the Big Ten. The rest are a combined 1-15 in the league, and a would-be reckoning at Penn State appears far less daunting now that the Nittany Lions  fired their coach  and lost their quarterback to injury.\n \n\n   \n  That would set up a potential Big Ten Championship Game showdown with the one contender the Hoosiers won’t face in the regular season:  Ohio State . The Hoosiers have won the conference title twice before, but it’s been almost 60 years since that glorious 1967 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  It is all quite heady and IU fans are basking in the joy. Clavio, for one, made the 10-hour roundtrip drive to Iowa and flew out for the game at Oregon. He’s already contemplating how to get to Maryland and Happy Valley.\n \n\n   \n  Patrons at Nick’s English Hut, the go-to spot for post-hoops victory revelry, broke out into song as the game clock hit zeroes against Oregon – a rousing rendition of the famous chorus from “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” –  and people are already imagining the giddy conundrum of important football games bleeding into basketball season.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also created yet another delightful first for the fall season in Bloomington: How to block out the noise.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on this campus since my freshman year in 1984 and the feeling on campus with football, I’ve never seen anything like it,’’ Dolson said. “There’s energy. There’s belief. There’s hope. But, and I know it sounds cliché, but internally, we’re focused on the work.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not thinking about how far we’ve come and what we’ve done. Because when you focus on the work, you’re thinking about what you haven’t done yet.’’\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/sport/football-nfl-week-8-chargers-vikings-tnf-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:20:00Z","title":"LA Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh joins historic club with big win over Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh joined a historic club after leading his team to a 37-10 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers head coach  Jim Harbaugh  joined a historic club after his team comfortably beat the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 on Thursday Night Football.\n \n\n   \n  Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert threw three touchdowns and running back Kimani Vidal rushed for over 100 yards and another score as LA dispatched the Vikings.\n \n\n   \n  With the victory, Harbaugh became just the second person in NFL history to earn 60 wins as both a starting quarterback and head coach. He joins Norm Van Brocklin as the only people to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  Harbaugh had a 66-74 record over a 13-year playing career in the  NFL  which included stints with the Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore Ravens and the then named San Diego Chargers.\n \n\n   \n  As a head coach, he compiled a 44-19-1 record with the San Francisco 49ers between 2011 and 2014 and Thursday’s victory improves his record with the Chargers to 16-9 in his two seasons back in California.\n \n\n   \n  The win over Minnesota at SoFi Stadium helps get the Chargers’ season back on track after the team lost three of their last four.\n \n\n   \n  The game began strongly for the home team, with LA leading 21-3 at halftime with three touchdown drives in the first two quarters.\n \n\n   \n  The Vikings got their only touchdown of the game with 4:36 left in the third quarter when back-up  quarterback  Carson Wentz connected with Jordan Addison to reduce LA’s lead to 14 points.\n \n\n   \n  But Minnesota failed to score again after that and the Chargers added 13-straight points to close out the victory and improve to 5-3.\n \n\n   \n  Herbert finished the game 18-of-25 passing for 227 yards, three TDs and one interception, while also running for 62 yards.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , it was Herbert’s third game of his NFL career with three-plus touchdown passes and more than 50 yards rushing, something no other quarterback in Chargers history has ever done.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Harbaugh was effusive in his praise of his star QB.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just another thing about Justin Herbert that I don’t know how he does it,” Harbaugh told reporters. “It’s nothing but respect.\n \n\n   \n  “To be able to actually throw an interception and then come back the next drive – that’s the great ones who can do that. The great, great ones. Just measure what they do after something goes bad, after there’s an interception. That’s the worst thing that can really happen to you as a quarterback. And then chart what they do with the next drive. That shakes a lot of guys. Not Justin Herbert, not the great ones, back right down the field. … It’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  For the Vikings, they slip to 3-4 and continue to struggle on offense with starting QB JJ McCarthy still sidelined with an ankle injury.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s replacement, Wentz, came into the game nursing a shoulder knock and looked out of sorts all evening as he made his fifth straight start for the team.\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota had just 164 total yards on offense while the Chargers had 419. LA also dominated the time of possession, having over 39 minutes of the ball while the Vikings had just under 21 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Wentz’s interception midway through the fourth quarter halted any slim hopes Minnesota might have had about a  dramatic comeback . And with the team’s playoffs hopes on the line, the return of McCarthy – who was the emergency third QB on Thursday – is expected before their Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  The only bright spot for the Vikings on Thursday was their star wide receiver Justin Jefferson having his own moment of history. Jefferson joined Hall of Famer Randy Moss (8,375 yards) and Torry Holt (8,156) as the only players with at least 8,000 receiving yards in their first six seasons in NFL history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/spanberger-sherrill-virginia-new-jersey-governor-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Once roommates, now candidates for governor: Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill try to lead a Democratic revival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, once roommates on Capitol Hill, are now running for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively, as part of a broader Democratic effort to rebuild after a devastating 2024 election loss.

\nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  They were faces of the Democratic resistance, a winning piece of the blue wave, when the party  swept control  of the House of Representatives in 2018 as a fierce reaction to President Donald Trump’s first two years in office.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill are seeking to spur another Democratic revival. Their respective races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey  offer potential lessons  for the party as it tries to rise from political exile and find a pathway back to power.\n \n\n   \n  “What we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,” Spanberger told a crowded rally here this week. “Are you ready to win?”\n \n\n   \n  A year after losing the White House and failing to win control of Congress, Democrats are working to move beyond the  soul-searching  and finger-pointing phase of their 2024 defeat. The November 4 elections are the latest test of the party’s efforts to rebuild, rebrand and rebound in the new Trump era.\n \n\n   \n  “This one’s too important,” Sherrill told supporters on a recent night, hoping to impress upon them the urgency of the moment. “Make sure no one sits this out.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the country that elect governors the year after a presidential campaign. The races could hold lessons for Democrats as they seek to unify their fraying coalitions, try to win over any disillusioned Trump voters and recruit candidates for next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Yet those races are only one chapter of the Democratic Party’s fight.\n \n\n   \n  An epic generational and ideological clash is unfolding in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani is working to take command in a mayoral race with Andrew Cuomo. The spirited campaign has shined a light on the risks and rewards for a party still reconciling its identity and finding the best approach to address the affordability crisis and other challenges facing Americans.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the blue wave\n \n\n   \n  It was 2018 when Spanberger, a former federal agent and CIA officer, was elected to a Congressional seat in central Virginia long held by Republicans. Her national security credentials and more centrist views appealed to suburban voters turned off by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  She once  confronted  progressive members of her own party in a private call, admonishing them “to not ever use the words ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again.” She won hard-fought re-election battles before stepping down at the end of her third term to focus on her run for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Her biography and a lifelong commitment to service is at the center of her bid for governor, where polls show she is leading Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Top Democrats have flocked to Virginia, eager to highlight Spanberger as a broader example for where the party stands.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything about her turns the GOP narrative about who Democrats are upside down,” Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate and transportation secretary, said as he rallied Spanberger’s supporters here. “This is what the mainstream actually looks like.”\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Sherrill was also part of the class of Democratic candidates in 2018 whose  national security credentials  were at the heart of their quest to win seats once held by Republicans. Her advertising campaign is built around her training as a pilot, with images of her flying a helicopter saying: “The Navy taught me in a crisis you either find a way or make one.”\n \n\n   \n  Locked in a particularly fierce fight in the closing days of the race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli has called out Sherrill’s frequent references to her military service. He minced few words to one crowd last week, saying: “She’ll tell you she knows how to fly a helicopter, but she doesn’t know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n    Capitol Hill roommates\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, forged a friendship after arriving on Capitol Hill. They became roommates and still have a running conversation about their respective races and how both could become the first Democratic female governor of their state. (The winner between Spanberger and Earle-Sears will make history as Virginia’s first female governor.)\n \n\n   \n  They’ve often talked about their common bonds, including how Spanberger was born in New Jersey and moved to Virginia at age 13, while Sherrill was born in Virginia and moved to New Jersey as an adult.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s somebody who comes from that national service background like I do. Someone who’s a mom, like I am. She has three kids, I have four,” Sherrill said in an interview. “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since.”\n \n\n   \n  They’ve also adopted similar approaches in their campaign by intentionally avoiding trying to add their voice to every Democratic criticism about Trump, but instead focusing on the  tangible effects  of Trump’s policies and whether he has lived up to promises made a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “He told people he would drive down their costs. I think a lot of people feel very let down,” Sherrill said. “As he’s raising their costs, he’s making billions of dollars. That is really speaking to people who say this is not some guy who has my interest at heart.”\n \n\n   \n  For all the similar strains of their candidacies, their challenges are quite distinct.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is running to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, which offers a far simpler case to make an argument for change.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Too many people to please’\n \n\n   \n  As the fall campaign heads into the home stretch, more than a dozen Democratic voters in Virginia and New Jersey told CNN they feel hopeful the party is starting to gain confidence and find its footing one year after a punishing loss that sent Trump back to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “It will rebuild itself. It just takes time,” said Barbara Lee, a retiree from Staunton, Virginia, who waited in line to see Spanberger at the Jefferson Theater in Charlottesville. “We need new leadership. Abigail can start us off.”\n \n\n   \n  But in the next breath, Lee echoed the sentiment of other Democrats when she said the party must work to extinguish ideological infighting that she believes runs as hot as ever.\n \n\n   \n  “We just have too many people to please. That’s why it’s so hard for us,” Lee said. “We are being attacked from all areas – not just Republicans – but from our own party. So let’s get that out of the way and we can go on to what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/health/florida-maha-medical-freedom-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"At the Hollow in Florida, the ‘medical freedom’ movement finds its base camp","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The medical freedom movement in Sarasota County, Florida, centered at The Hollow and promoted by figures like Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his wife Brianna, has gained traction by blending anti-vaccination ideologies, conspiracy theories about government and chemtrails, and right-wing political affiliations.

The keynote speech was by William Makis,  a litigious covid conspiracist  who, after losing his medical license in 2019, has made a living treating cancer patients with antiparasitic drugs including ivermectin, which was also championed in some circles as a covid treatment during the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Clinical trials showed that ivermectin didn’t work, but covid skeptics viewed medicine’s rejection of it as part of a conspiracy by Big Pharma against a cheap, off-patent drug. Some of the patients in his care have what he calls “turbo cancers,” Makis says, blaming alleged impurities in mRNA vaccines that he says have killed millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  For Makis, it’s all one big conspiracy — the virus, the vaccine, and the suppression of his therapies.\n \n\n   \n  Brianna Ladapo has her own take on medicine, based on the idea of good and bad spiritual energy. She wrote in a memoir that as the pandemic began she intuited that it had been planned by “sinister forces” to “frighten the masses to surrender their sovereignty to a small group of tyrannical elites.” She has written that the government  hides vaccination’s risks .\n \n\n   \n  She sees “dark forces” all over the place, including, she said  in a podcast interview  earlier this year, in “chemtrails” shaped like a pentagram. “They’ve been plastering it in the sky right outside our house for the last few weeks,” Ladapo said. The chemtrails “they are dumping on us,” she said, had sickened her and her three sons. “The dark side are no fans of ours.”\n \n\n   \n  (“Chemtrails” are a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists who say they think that contrails, the condensation formed around commercial airplane exhaust, contain toxic substances poisoning people and the terrain. Although there is zero evidence of that, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  plans to look into  whether they are part of a clandestine effort to use toxic chemicals to change the weather.)\n \n\n   \n  Ladapo’s husband hasn’t publicly endorsed all her beliefs, but as surgeon general he’s reversing decades of accepted public health practice in Florida and embracing untested therapies. “We’re done with fear,” Joseph Ladapo said after being named surgeon general in 2021. He wants to ban mRNA vaccines in Florida, and on Sept. 3 he announced plans to end childhood vaccination mandates in the state.\n \n\n   \n  A few days after the Venice event, Ladapo  said he hoped  to support Makis’ work — though his treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous — through a new $60 million cancer research fund created by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife, Casey.\n \n\n   \n  Vic Mellor, CEO of  a local concrete business , founded and owns We the People. He’s an associate of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump’s national security adviser in 2017 before being dismissed for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Trump later pardoned him, and Flynn since has become a leader of the Christian nationalist movement.\n \n\n   \n  We the People provides vitamin shots but no vaccines. In fact, many of its offerings are treatments for supposed vaccine injuries. Part of the We the People building is a broadcasting studio, where conservatives hold forth on what they see as the villainy of liberals and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n\n   \n  Mellor was at the U.S. Capitol during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021 — he said he “just knocked on front doors,” according to a Facebook post described  by The Washington Post . He returned home and started building a 10-acre complex that hosts weddings and right-wing assemblies, with playgrounds, a butterfly garden, a zip line over a pond visited by alligators, and an attached, separately owned gun range.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors who travel down a dirt road to The Hollow — named for the hollow-core concrete that made Mellor wealthy — can enter the compound through a dark, cavernous passage lined with neon signs illuminating maxims from the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  The Hollow has hosted clinics for unvaccinated kids and events  for Ladapo , anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny (who in 2021 told legislators at  an Ohio House hearing  that covid vaccine made people magnetic), and other “medical freedom” advocates. Mellor created a medical home for such ideas by  opening We the People  in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The year before, three “medical freedom” candidates had won seats on the board overseeing Sarasota’s public hospital and health care system, after protests over the hospital’s refusal to treat covid patients with ivermectin and other drugs of choice for covid contrarians.\n \n\n   \n  On a recent afternoon at The Hollow, manager Dan Welch was clearing brush when approached by KFF Health News. As a foe of vaccinations, he welcomed Ladapo’s move to end vaccine mandates. “Maybe in their inception, vaccines were created to prevent what they were supposed to prevent,” Welch said. “But now there’s so much more in there, the metals, aluminum, mercury. Since they started vaccination, the autism rate went through the roof, and I believe these vaccines are part of it.”\n \n\n   \n  The theory that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, and manufacturers removed mercury from childhood vaccines 24 years ago, although Welch said he doesn’t believe it.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination faces additional challenges in a century-old Sarasota County neighborhood of low-slung bungalows called Pinecraft, home to about 3,000 Mennonites — and double that number when Amish snowbirds arrive in the winter. Pastor Timothy Miller said that while Sarasota’s Mennonites are less culturally isolated than the Mennonite community in West Texas, site of a measles outbreak in January, many in his community also shun vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  His cousin Kristi Miller, 26, won’t vaccinate her 9-month-old daughter or any of the other children she hopes to have, she said, because she thinks vaccines probably cause autism and other harms.\n \n\n   \n  As for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, she doesn’t worry about them.  Like the Ladapos , “I don’t live in fear,” she said. “I have a God who’s bigger than everything.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/science/london-underground-mosquito-debunked-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"06:42:00-04:00","title":"‘London Underground mosquito’ is actually much older than previously thought","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new genetic study led by Yuki Haba and Lindy McBride refutes the long-held belief that the 'London Underground mosquito' (Culex pipiens form molestus) evolved in the tunnels of London during or after World War II.

Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:42 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.\n \n\n   \n  The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form   molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that  published  Thursday in the journal Science.\n \n\n   \n  In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”\n \n\n   \n    Migrating north\n \n\n   \n  The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.\n \n\n   \n  In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.\n \n\n   \n  “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”\n \n\n   \n  At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.\n \n\n   \n  The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first  described  as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”\n \n\n   \n  This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”\n \n\n   \n  There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.\n \n\n   \n    Mosquito opportunities\n \n\n   \n  Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”\n \n\n   \n  The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”\n \n\n   \n  Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/who-gets-paid-during-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Here’s who’s getting paid — and who isn’t — during the federal government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025, over 1 million federal workers face unpaid or furloughed work, with significant financial hardship for families.

government shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  Many will miss their first full paychecks on Friday, while others will feel the loss early next week, depending on their agency.\n \n\n   \n  But lawmakers on Capitol Hill will still collect their paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked a GOP-led bill to  pay workers who are deemed essential  during the shutdown. Many Democrats have said they want to pass a bill that also pays furloughed federal employees, though Republicans on Thursday rejected their alternatives. But some Republicans and Democrats have expressed optimism that there could be a bipartisan deal on a compromise measure.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n  And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is  temporarily recalling  roughly 3,000 furloughed employees amid open enrollment for Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, starting Monday. They will be paid for the time they are working.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned last week that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/zhang-chinese-fentanyl-kingpin-us-extradition-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:34:00-04:34","title":"Mexico hands suspected Chinese fentanyl kingpin over to US authorities, minister says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexico has transferred Zhi Dong Zhang, a suspected Chinese national operating under the alias 'Brother Wang,' to U.S. authorities for alleged drug trafficking and money laundering.

Chauncey Billups and NBA star Terry Rozier \n       \n  By Dana O'Neil, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:55 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones  are among 34 people indicted in connection  with two separate federal gambling investigations announced by the Eastern District of New York on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  At a lengthy and at times spirited news conference that included FBI Director Kash Patel, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr., and others detailed the sweeping multi-year investigations that spanned 11 states, resulted in the arrests of 34 people, involved tens of millions of dollars and included members of the notorious Bonanno, Genovese, Gambino and Luchese crime families.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, who coached in the Trail Blazers’ opening game on Wednesday night, was arrested in Portland on Thursday morning and is expected to appear in federal court there later on Thursday. Rozier, arrested in Orlando, will appear there.\n \n\n   \n  Both will be arraigned at a later date in Brooklyn.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, who retired in 2012, is one of three people to be charged in both cases.\n \n\n   \n  “My message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,’’ Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.’’\n \n\n   \n  Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, is charged in an elaborate scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star as well as Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Billups, Nocella said, knowingly served as the so-called “face card,” to attract the “fish,” to underground games in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and the Hamptons that they had no chance of winning. Those involved in the scheme used rigged card-shuffling machines, poker chip trays and even special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. In some instances, the alleged conspirators used X-ray tables that reveal cards when they are placed face down.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said the scheme, deemed “Zen Diagram” by the feds, “fleeced” victims out of tens of millions of dollars. One alleged victim lost $1.8 million. The money was then laundered by the crime families.\n \n\n   \n  “And when people refused to pay, these defendants did what organized crime has always done,’’ New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “They used threats. They used intimidation. And they used violence. It’s the same pattern that we have seen for decades, traditional mob enforcement methods combined with new technology to expand the reach of their operations.’’\n \n\n   \n  Rozier, who was arrested in an Orlando hotel, was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators allege between December 2022 and March 2024, Rozier tipped people about his availability for games, citing seven specific games in their investigation including one, against the New Orleans Pelicans, already flagged by sportsbooks for irregular activity.\n \n\n   \n  In that March 2023 game, Rozier, then with the Charlotte Hornets, left the game after just nine minutes with an injury. According to investigators, Rozier shared that inside information, and his co-conspirator bettors made $200,000 in wagers on the under.\n \n\n   \n  “Those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit,’’ Tisch said. “The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash.’’\n \n\n   \n  That investigation, deemed “Nothing But Net,” also included the previous arrest of former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter, who was banned from the NBA in 2024 and later admitted to manipulating his performance in two games. He is awaiting sentencing.\n \n\n   \n  Nocella said other defendants involved in the case threatened Porter, who had pre-existing gambling debts, in order to get the inside information.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the insider trading saga of the NBA,’’ FBI Director Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA has said previously it looked into the game involving Rozier against the Pelicans and that no rules had been broken. He was with the Heat, who opened their season on Wednesday, but did not play due to a coach’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.\n \n\n   \n  “But at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,’’ Trusty said.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case. They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Trail Blazers and other teams mentioned in the news conference. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NBA said, “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.”\n \n\n   \n  The Heat directed press inquiries to the NBA statement. The Trail Blazers noted that Tiago Splitter will be taking on interim head coaching duties as Billups is on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim. Any further questions should be directed to the NBA,” the Blazers said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Scannell and Mark Morales contributed reporting to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/world/new-zealand-fugitive-father-secret-camps-revealed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00Z","title":"Photos reveal the secret bush camps fugitive father used to hide his children","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tom Phillips, a father from Marokopa, New Zealand, took his three children into the remote wilderness following a family split in December 2021.

investigating how a father hid his children from the world for almost four years in dense New Zealand wilderness have released new images of two makeshift camps where they believe the family spent most of their time.\n \n\n   \n  The photos of remote bush hideouts used by Tom Phillips, who was shot dead by police last month, show two large “established” camps which were “heavily concealed” by thick vegetation, north and east of Marokopa, on the country’s western coast.\n \n\n   \n  Detectives believe they served as the family’s main strongholds, enabling Phillips to navigate between the coast, farmland and wilderness with his three children ages 9 to 12.\n \n\n   \n  The secret bases helped the family live undetected until police finally tracked Phillips  down in the early hours of September 8 , and retrieved the children from deep within the forest.\n \n\n   \n  The images released Friday show a northern site with a wooden hut crafted from logs and topped with what appears to be a thatched straw roof, with its walls partially exposed to the elements.\n \n\n   \n  An image of the interior shows a damp, muddy floor, a plastic bucket, two partially filled jerry cans and a thick rope tethered to a stump atop a supporting wooden pole.\n \n\n   \n  An aerial shot of the eastern hideout captures it as a mere speck beneath an expansive tree canopy.\n \n\n   \n  Closer images reveal a more substantial structure with a pointed roof, made from logs and foliage, housing a log table and several bags, rope and a helmet hanging from the rafters which are covered by a plastic tarpaulin.\n \n\n   \n  An additional photo shows a low shelter, barely tall enough to sit upright, covered in foliage camouflaging the family’s location.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said stumbling upon these sites by chance would have been almost impossible and that approaching Phillips in such circumstances “would have been extremely dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “As we’ve said previously, we knew he had firearms and was motivated to use them,” Detective Superintendent Ross McKay said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have removed a haul of items from the camps for forensic examination as part of ongoing enquiries to identify anyone who might have assisted Phillips during his time on the run.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to make good progress and believe he was assisted by a small number of people at different stages over the last four years,” McKay added.\n \n\n   \n  Phillips, who came from a farming family in Marokopa, disappeared with his children into the rugged wilderness during a bitter family split in December 2021.\n \n\n   \n  At first, Phillips was wanted for failing to appear in court on charges of wasting police resources but, over the course of almost four years, his charge sheet grew longer and more serious, with allegations that he robbed a bank in May 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Police scrambled search teams, helicopters and planes to investigate sporadic sightings until police finally confronted him on a rural road and returned gunfire when he shot and injured an officer.\n \n\n   \n  The eldest child was with him when he was shot dead by police. The other two siblings were found hours later, alone at the camp.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/chicago-ice-raids-resistance-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Residents in Chicago Suburbs Resist ICE Raids Amid Widespread Immigration Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, residents of Mount Prospect, Illinois, and other Chicago suburbs resisted a federal immigration enforcement operation involving masked ICE agents and helicopters under the Trump administration’s 'Operation Midway Blitz.'

residents were sheltering from the cold and rain on a sleepy Sunday afternoon watching TV, scrolling through social media and enjoying midday coffee at home.\n \n\n   \n  As rain pattered against windows, and trees lining the streets swayed, flurries of urgent texts began ricocheting from one end of the neighborhood to the other, and panic set in as some residents put on their shoes and hurried out the door.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE IS HERE,” one text between Mount Prospect neighbors said.\n \n\n   \n  “F**king helicopters. Ice at Owen Park,” read another. “On our way,” one neighbor replied.\n \n\n   \n  The historic suburb quickly devolved into a scene that has  become familiar  to places like nearby  Chicago  and elsewhere across the country as President Donald Trump works to execute his Day 1 promise to crack down on  immigration and crime : A Homeland Security helicopter whirred overhead, several SUVs and trucks with tinted windows drove slowly past houses, and around two dozen masked federal agents meandered through yards and walked down sidewalks, according to images and interviews with residents.\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors stepped out of their homes to document the agents who had descended on their community, joining a coalition of opposition to the president’s unwavering determination to  detain and deport undocumented migrants  en masse  – a  resistance effort  spreading throughout US cities that have seen their workers, schoolchildren and community members swept up in ICE raids.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Response network confirmed high levels of immigration enforcement activity in Rolling Meadows, Wheeling, Prospect Heights & Mt. Prospect,” read a text from an ICE activity alert system run by a local immigrant rights group, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “At least 4 people have been detained.”\n \n\n   \n  Without knowing exactly where she was headed, Mount Prospect resident and small business owner Dawn Ardito grabbed her phone and driver’s license and rushed out the door after receiving some of the texts. She had reached only the end of her block before spotting the first set of SUVs with dark windows driven by men in masks and fatigues.\n \n\n   \n  She followed the cars to a nearby street with even more SUVs and agents. Ardito joined the handful of neighbors who had gathered, recording the federal officers with her phone, asking them what they were doing and demanding they leave.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t belong here,” Ardito said she told immigration enforcement agents. “Our neighbors, they do belong here. Our community members, they do belong here.”\n \n\n   \n  Agents told residents they were looking for an “escaped criminal,” describing the person to Ardito and others as a “gang member” at one point, then a “murder suspect” and “sex offender” as the operation went on.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Mount Prospect police said they encountered the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while responding to a 911 call about a person running through a nearby backyard. Officers left after they “confirmed these were federal agents,” and didn’t participate in the operation, “as this would be in violation of Illinois State Law and the Trust Act,” Officer Greg Sill said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Another person living in Mount Prospect who was mobilized by the texts, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said she hoped to chase out the agents with her screams like she’d seen in videos on social media of similar encounters around Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “People should be coming out of their houses and confronting (agents),” the resident said. “I have neighbors who are terrified to leave their houses. … Nobody should have to live like that, not in any neighborhood.”\n \n\n   \n  For more than an hour, residents screamed, videotaped and tailed federal vehicles, raucously honking horns to send the message: Their operation is not welcome here.\n \n\n   \n  Agents left the area after about two hours, neighbors said. It’s not clear whether agents arrested the person they told residents they were searching for.\n \n\n   \n  “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Ardito said. “Just because you haven’t seen it outside your front door like I saw it this weekend -– only time will tell until we all see that.”\n \n\n   \n    Packing whistle kits and buying out street vendors: How Chicagoans are opposing ICE in their neighborhoods\n \n\n   \n  At “ No Kings ” protests, Latino independence  celebrations  or ordinary afternoons in the streets of Chicago, bright orange whistles swing from community members’ necks, ready to cut through the city’s bustle should federal immigration agents appear.\n \n\n   \n  The whistles have become a peaceful display of opposition as  federal agents have been deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  In Belmont Cragin, a northwest Chicago community, local organizers have rallied hundreds of volunteers to create kits packed with the whistles, handouts showing when to use them and bilingual flyers detailing what bystanders’ and detainees’ rights are when agents are conducting arrests.\n \n\n   \n  One pamphlet in the kit reads, “Form a crowd, stay loud,” instructing users to blow the whistles as they spot ICE activity to guide nearby Chicagoans to where the agents are patrolling or conducting arrests so they can make noise, document or follow agents’ caravans.\n \n\n   \n  Alonso Zaragoza, an organizer helping to run Belmont Cragin United, said the group has 30,000 whistle kits to distribute throughout the city. The group is hosting its next “Whistlemania” event October 29, when nearly 80 Chicago communities are expected to come together to fold pamphlets and pack plastic whistles to reach their goal of 100,000 kits.\n \n\n   \n  “Immigrants keep us moving forward. They’re the oil in the machine that is our community,” Zaragoza said. “Hopefully Whistlemania takes off in other communities, like in  Portland , to protect their immigrant populations.”\n \n\n   \n  But many immigrants in Chicago now fear venturing out into the very community they help sustain.\n \n\n   \n  West 26th Street, in the predominantly Latino community of Little Village, once boasted an array of friendly street vendors selling shaved ice and fresh corn, with their carts dotting the busy road. Since “Operation Midway Blitz” launched, locals say street corners are emptier, and vendors who set up shop do so at their own risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody who is getting arrested right now are people who are going to work,” said Erendira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit. “Folks have to stay inside to stay safe.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago resident Rick Rosales, a community organizer and co-founder of Cycling x Solidarity, a local cycling group dedicated to mutual aid, started raising money when raids began to ramp up to buy up all the vendors’ food to get them off the street for the day.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday morning, Rosales and a few other volunteers biked up to a woman selling empanadas in the pouring rain. On the street next to her tent, the woman’s young child was sitting in her parked car as she worked. The bikers bought every empanada she had.\n \n\n   \n  “She was incredibly grateful, very taken by surprise,” Rosales said. “And no sooner did we pack up the bikes with all her goods, she’s already packed up her cooler and tent. It’s cold, it’s raining, it’s early in the morning – she has a child, and now they get to go home.”\n \n\n   \n  After buying out a vendor, the bikers pass out the food to encampments and shelters.\n \n\n   \n  Rosales’ group works with the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, which typically helps vendors design menus and obtain permits, to fundraise and identify sellers. Together, the groups organize bike tours where riders buy from a series of vendors as they explore the city.\n \n\n   \n  “A few of our vendors have been detained (by ICE),” said Maria Orozco, outreach coordinator of the association. “So, we try to protect our vendors and make sure they’re good and make sure that the community supports them.”\n \n\n   \n    Chicago is the epicenter of immigration crackdowns amid ongoing legal battles\n \n\n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with residents, Chicago is being cemented as the  epicenter  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of legal developments.\n \n\n   \n  The Windy City was thrust into the national spotlight after a federal appeals court temporarily  allowed the federalization  of Illinois National Guard troops but blocked their deployment within the state.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, putting the explosive legal fight over his ability to use those troops on American soil before the justices for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  That framing stands in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order  earlier this month .\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois and the city of Chicago have  asked the justices  to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state and have fiercely denied the administration’s descriptions of crime in the Prairie State’s biggest city.\n \n\n   \n  For residents in Chicago communities like Little Village and Belmont Cragin, and outside city limits in Mount Prospect and across Illinois, the work goes on.\n \n\n   \n  “I now have this whole new network of people that we have connected with, and having this firsthand experience, it has really bonded us,” Ardito said. “We are now making sure we’re connected and looking for what we can do to continue to protect our community and to continue to push back.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/abbe-lowell-letitia-james-attorney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Washington mega lawyer Abbe Lowell, 73, is the fresh face of the Trump resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abbe Lowell, a 73-year-old Washington-based attorney with a long history of defending political figures in politically charged legal cases, is now a prominent figure in the resistance against Donald Trump's administration.

fresh face of the Trump resistance \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attorney Abbe Lowell stood beside  John Bolton  in a federal courthouse in Maryland last week as Donald Trump’s former national security adviser pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, Lowell was at a federal appeals court in Philadelphia arguing that President Trump’s  choice of US attorney for New Jersey  is unlawful. And on Friday, Lowell will be beside New York Attorney General  Letitia James  in Norfolk, Virginia, as she is arraigned on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James has called the charges “baseless.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowell has for decades been a moth to the flame of Washington politics and scandal. He built his reputation by getting politicians out of legal trouble or advocating pointedly before television cameras to try to sway public opinion and influence prosecutors’ decision making.\n \n\n   \n  Now, at 73, Lowell is one of the most prominent faces defending many of Trump’s perceived enemies in criminal investigations, security clearance revocations, and other matters.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lawyers’ lawyer in that the politics aren’t what motivates the case,” said Mark Zaid, a high-profile Washington, DC, lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Zaid hired Lowell and other attorneys when the Trump administration revoked his security clearance.  They filed a lawsuit, which is pending, to try to get it restored.\n \n\n   \n  “He argues for the rule of law and this administration is subverting the rule of law so much that I wish there was an army of Abbe Lowells who, even if they didn’t have his skill, that they have his desire to uphold the integrity of the system and the principles that this country was founded on,” Zaid said.\n \n\n   \n  While Lowell is taking on Trump now, his past clients include Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner when they were questioned as part of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He also defended President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who went to trial and was convicted of gun-related charges. Biden also pleaded guilty to tax crimes. (He was later pardoned.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Lowell left Winston & Strawn, the large DC law firm where he spent the past seven years, to set up his own firm to represent clients in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. He’s bolstered his team with a cadre of young lawyers.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to James, Bolton and Zaid, Lowell is also representing others targeted by Trump, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell declined to be interviewed. In a statement he said he started his own firm to fill a need.\n \n\n   \n  “The catalyst was the Trump administration’s attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics. I have challenged government overreach in every administration since President Reagan, but the scale and scope of Trump’s intrusion required action,” Lowell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised on Long Island where his father was an insurance agent and his mother was a doctor’s assistant. He graduated from Columbia Law School and swiftly made his way to Washington and into politics.\n \n\n   \n  He served as counsel to House Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings. Soon thereafter Lowell represented California Democratic Rep. Gary Condit during the disappearance of intern Chandra Levy in 2001. Condit was  interviewed  by the police amid reports of a romantic relationship with her. He declined to speak to the media, while Lowell frequently sparred with journalists on TV. Condit was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards hired Lowell when he went on trial on campaign finance charges. The trial dominated the headlines. Edwards was acquitted of one charge and the jury deadlocked on others.\n \n\n   \n  “In these politically charged cases you have to wear two hats. You have to be traditionally good in court … but then you also have to have some sophistication about the way Washington works. Abbe wears both,” said Reid Weingarten, a Washington criminal defense lawyer and long-time friend of Lowell’s. “I think the Edwards trial sent him on the path to become a defense attorney trial guy.”\n \n\n   \n  Weingarten encountered Lowell decades earlier when he was a prosecutor investigating a Tennessee lawmaker who Lowell represented.\n \n\n   \n  “Each thing he handled he took incredibly seriously like there was nothing more important than this particular matter, this client, this cross examination. It accounts for much of his success,” said Weingarten. “He devotes his all to it and Abbe’s all is way more than most.” (The lawmaker was not charged with any wrongdoing.)\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez turned to Lowell when he faced bribery charges in 2017. Then, a Newark jury failed to reach a verdict and a federal judge later  acquitted  Menendez on some charges. (Menendez was convicted in 2024 on different bribery charges in New York. Lowell did not represent him at trial).\n \n\n   \n  Lowell also represented Matthew Grimes, a former assistant to Trump donor and loyalist Tom Barrack. Barrack, who is now US ambassador to Turkey, and Grimes were both acquitted of federal charges of acting as foreign agents.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, Lowell fumbled with his microphone as he spoke with the jury and read aloud text messages, translating emojis as “smiley face,” that Grimes sent to an overseas counterpart who was part of the alleged scheme.\n \n\n   \n  One person involved in the case, who did not want to be identified, said Lowell’s actions appeared to disarm his client to the jury and turned the allegedly criminal exchanges into seemingly benign chats between young men looking to impress each other.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands all the intangibles that go into presenting to a jury that’s different from the facts and the law. Those are the things that make him a very good lawyer,” said one lawyer who has opposed him.\n \n\n   \n  “Outside of the courtroom, generally, he’s a tough guy. He’s no holds-barred – a lot of posturing, a lot of self-righteousness. It worked for him,” the person said.\n \n\n   \n    Accused of posturing\n \n\n   \n  Lowell’s posturing and what some lawyers describe as brash manner aren’t without controversy.\n \n\n   \n  He took over Hunter Biden’s representation after a plea deal to end the criminal investigation blew up spectacularly during a court hearing, ending any potential for the case to be resolved before his father’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell shifted the strategy to a more aggressive public posture, sparring with Republicans on the hill and teeing the case for trial.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, lurid details of Hunter Biden’s drug use and sex life spilled into the public in the middle of Biden’s re-election campaign.\n \n\n   \n  During  opening arguments , Lowell leaned into Biden’s drug use as something millions of Americans deal with. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times.\n \n\n   \n  Lowell used the same direct manner in representing James, writing pointed letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin, who was named special attorney for mortgage fraud at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Martin criticized Lowell’s tactics, writing in a private letter, “Because of your reputation for using the media to argue your points, I prefer that we communicate by letter. I find leaks like your Bondi letter professionally unacceptable and personally insulting. To that end, I specifically ask that you redouble your efforts to not leak this confidential letter.”\n \n\n   \n  Six days later, Lowell replied.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot unilaterally conduct a media campaign to prejudice and intimidate my client and expect there will be no similar public response,” Lowell wrote. “And, whenever you do bring your threatened action, please explain to the judges before whom you file all that you have been saying and doing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-sophia-forchas-released","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00.000-04:00","title":"57 Days After a Gunshot to the Head, 12-Year-Old School Massacre Survivor Returns Home","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 12-year-old girl, Sophia Forchas, survived a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School on August 27, 2025, when a gunman opened fire during a prayer session, killing two children and injuring 20 others.

On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James is due to be arraigned in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  And  CNN reported  Thursday that Ed Martin, one of the most polarizing Trump Justice Department officials, has been pushing for the investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff’s alleged mortgage fraud to lead to an indictment, despite prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office being hesitant to proceed with charges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump declined to weigh in on a possible Schiff indictment on Thursday, saying, “I hope it’s true, but I don’t know anything.”\n \n\n   \n  As the administration has targeted the president’s enemies, the big question has been whether Americans would see it as just some political tit-for-tat equivalent to the indictments of Trump, or whether they’d recognize it as an extraordinary weaponization of the justice system.\n \n\n   \n  The early verdict is in.\n \n\n   \n  Americans seem to see charges the Trump administration has brought against its enemies as significantly less serious and significantly more politicized than the indictments of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  A  Quinnipiac University poll  this week showed voters agreed 52%-38% that Trump was “using the U.S. Justice Department to file unjustified criminal charges against his political opponents.”\n \n\n   \n  Independents agreed with that sentiment by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58%-31%.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll , meanwhile, showed Americans said 55%-26% that Trump was using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies. Even 29% of Republicans agreed with this.\n \n\n   \n  (The question, unlike the Quinnipiac poll, didn’t ask people to judge the legitimacy of the charges.)\n \n\n   \n  The polls would seem to be in line with a late September  survey from the Pew Research Center .\n \n\n   \n  That poll was conducted shortly after Trump removed a US attorney who resisted bringing charges against James and issued a public call for Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring them against Comey and James. Comey’s indictment landed soon after, which fell in the middle of the poll’s survey period.\n \n\n   \n  Pew showed 62% of Americans agreed Trump was at least “probably” improperly encouraging federal investigations of his political opponents. Even 40% of Republican-leaning Americans said Trump was probably doing this.\n \n\n   \n  These are pretty striking numbers that suggest a potential political problem for Trump, even as he moves forward.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps most notably, the numbers suggest Americans see the situation as quite different from Trump’s indictments.\n \n\n   \n  The president baselessly accused then-President Joe Biden and a “weaponized” Justice Department of being behind the charges against him. (In fact, there is  much more to tie Trump to orchestrating the Comey and James indictments .)\n \n\n   \n  Analysts have generally regarded the recent classified documents charges against a third Trump foe, former national security adviser John Bolton,  as being more substantial . The case originated in the Biden administration, and Trump didn’t publicly push it like he did the James and Comey cases – or fire a prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  But Americans seem to see the charges against Trump as simply more serious than the overall charges his administration has brought against his enemies.\n \n\n   \n  While just 38% of voters in the Quinnipiac poll said the charges against Trump’s opponents were justified, Americans generally said by clear, double-digit margins that the cases against Trump were legitimate – and even that he was guilty. (Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases against him.)\n \n\n   \n  Americans said 56%-41% that the investigations against Trump were “fair” rather than a “witch hunt,” according to a  March 2023 Marist College poll  conducted shortly before his  first indictment.\n \n\n   \n  And they said  47%-31% that the charges owed to Trump’s own actions , rather than an “abuse of the justice system,” according to an August 2023 CNN poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans said  57%-41%  that the Justice Department was holding Trump accountable like anyone else, rather than that DOJ was “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons,” according to a December 2023 Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.\n \n\n   \n  And they said 58%-37% that there was “credible evidence” that Trump committed serious federal crimes, according to an August 2023  Public Religion Research Institute poll .\n \n\n   \n  Near-majorities of Americans  saw political motivations  in many of the cases. And even more saw that in the Manhattan hush money case in which Trump was eventually convicted.\n \n\n   \n  But that didn’t mean Americans saw those cases as illegitimate “witch hunts” or “hoaxes,” as Trump claims they were.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Americans seem much more inclined to believe that about the cases Trump is orchestrating against his foes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/navy-building-ice-detention-facilities","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-10:24","title":"Trump Administration Turns to U.S. Navy to Speed Up Migrant Detention Center Construction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is accelerating the construction of a nationwide network of migrant detention centers by partnering with the U.S. Navy through a joint Department of Homeland Security and Defense Department initiative.

US Navy \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Priscilla Alvarez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Fri October 24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy to help facilitate the construction of a sprawling network of migrant   detention centers across the US in an arrangement aimed at getting the centers built faster, according to sources and federal contracting documents.\n \n\n   \n  Construction on some of the facilities is set to begin as soon as next month, one of the sources familiar with the project told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest example of the Trump administration  leveraging the US military  to support its immigration enforcement efforts, stemming from the White House’s desire to dramatically  ramp up nationwide immigration operations  and arrest a record number of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  The contracting program, which has not been previously reported, is a joint effort between DHS and the Defense Department and leans on the Navy’s Supply Systems Command as a contracting arm to hire companies for construction and maintenance of the detention facilities.\n \n\n   \n  The new detention centers are likely to be primarily soft-sided tents and may or may not be built on existing Navy installations, according to the sources familiar with the initiative. DHS has often leaned on soft-sided facilities to manage influxes of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources said the goal is for the facilities to house as many as 10,000 people each, and are expected to be built in Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Utah and Kansas. Additional details about the facilities remain unclear, as the contracting process is still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  An uptick in immigration arrests has required more detention space to hold people for processing and potentially deportation. ICE, which also uses local jails to hold people, was previously funded for around 41,000 beds to temporarily house detainees. White House border czar Tom Homan has said he wants to double that number of detention beds—and fast.\n \n\n   \n  For that reason, Homeland Security officials have been trying to find ways to quickly secure contracts, which can often be delayed by federal competition rules. DHS has been “bouncing around from one contract vehicle to another,” one source said, as challenges and delays in contracts have previously created headaches for the department.\n \n\n   \n  In July, ICE secured $45 billion worth of additional funding from Congress to build new detention facilities. One such facility was built at Fort Bliss Army base in Texas and  reportedly violated  dozens of federal detention standards.\n \n\n   \n  The latest contract approach, through the Defense Department, is expected to narrow the pool of eligible contractors and accelerate the contracting process, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy solicitation listed on a federal contracting site provides a preview of what will be expected of contractors. For example, they will be expected to build a range of structures within the detention facilities themselves, including courtrooms and administrative and support space for ICE staff, according to the documents reviewed by CNN. And they will be required to ensure ready access to emergency services and airport transfers, the documents say, highlighting ICE’s varied needs as it works to carry out Trump’s mass deportation agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The Navy and DHS did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not surprising they would do this, especially for this type of quick turnaround construction,” said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense spending. “The military is good at logistics, and they’ve had to do quick turn construction projects like this overseas. You’re already dealing with an organization that knows how to do this type of contracting activity, and do it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  To facilitate the construction, the Navy quietly broadened an existing contracting mechanism in July to “add a new geographic region”— the United States and outlying territories.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, the contract solicitation, known as the Worldwide Expeditionary Multiple Award Contract, had been used primarily to support military operations abroad. But in July, it was amended as “WEXMAC 2.1, Territorial Integrity of the United States,” and now notes that contractors “may be required to provide infrastructure, staffing, services, and/or supplies necessary to provide safe and secure confinement for aliens in the administrative custody” of DHS and ICE.\n \n\n   \n  It also stipulates that new contracts will involve Defense Support of Civil Authorities — a process by which US military assets and personnel can be used to support domestic law enforcement missions — and says that contractors “will provide for the secure custody, care, and safekeeping of aliens in accordance with state and local laws, standards, policies, procedures for firearms requirements, or court orders applicable.”\n \n\n   \n  The new solicitation also says that contractors building and staffing the facilities do not have “right of refusal, and shall take all referrals from ICE as applicable.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/china/china-fourth-plenum-five-year-plan-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00Z","title":"In its rivalry with the US, China sees an advantage: the long game","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has concluded a closed-door session to draft its next five-year economic blueprint, emphasizing long-term strategic planning as a key political advantage in its rivalry with the United States.

24, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Chinese leaders have just concluded a  closed-door conclave  focused on drawing up the country’s next five-year economic blueprint – a sweeping plan covering everything from accelerating tech innovation to streamlining how China’s farms grow food.\n \n\n   \n  Stakes are high for formulating that strategy, with Chinese officials under pressure to reduce reliance on imported technology and address economic weaknesses as the country faces a deepening rivalry with the US.\n \n\n   \n  But drawing up the plan – especially at a moment when Washington remains  immobilized by a government shutdown  over spending for the current fiscal year – also gives leader Xi Jinping an opportunity to showcase a source of his confidence in China’s rise: the authoritarian country’s ability to produce – and deliver on – far-reaching visions.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese state media and officials have not been delicate about playing up what they see as that competitive advantage in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “Scientifically formulating and continuously implementing the five-year plan is … a key political advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Many foreign political parties envy us for this,” Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee’s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for “gaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.”\n \n\n   \n  A  commentary  in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily published Thursday praised how China “views the whole country as one chessboard… and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,” while “some countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.”\n \n\n   \n  “Long-termism,” a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something “Western countries find difficult to match,” another  article , in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.\n \n\n   \n  A separate  commentary  published by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the “out of control” situation in the US, pointing to the “No Kings” protests, the government shutdown, and a controversial  AI-generated video meme  shared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It concluded: “The (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump’s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is ‘dying from within.’”\n \n\n   \n  Such rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China’s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country’s ruling Communist Party – and its leader Xi – at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  And the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn’t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding its  rare earths export control regime. \n \n\n   \n    The five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China’s continued rise.\n \n\n   \n  “We will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country’s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,” a communique released by state media Thursday said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials would “accelerate the development of building China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaders signaled they would stay the course on “accelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance” and infusing high tech into industry – building on China’s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.\n \n\n   \n  “The proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,” Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to “accelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities” for the military.\n \n\n   \n  Officials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would “vigorously boost consumption” and “improve the social security system,” as well as further opening China’s market to international players, according to the communique.\n \n\n   \n  How officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A vital political advantage’\n \n\n   \n  Observers have long noted the ability of China’s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.\n \n\n   \n  The country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.\n \n\n   \n  And as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China’s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.\n \n\n   \n  “In today’s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such ‘unpredictability’ has cast a shadow over world peace and development,” an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  “The development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China’s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times – certainty,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote – and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers – China’s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls “mass consultation” with various sectors of society. Xi sits “at the helm” of this process, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  Once set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party’s.\n \n\n   \n  Such plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The “Great Leap Forward” associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China’s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, plans have spurred China’s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.\n \n\n   \n  Take EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.\n \n\n   \n  But for Xi, who is determined not to see China’s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it’s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.\n \n\n   \n  Or in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China’s “revitalization,” this planning creates “a vital political advantage.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/virginia-democrats-house-redistricting-battle","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:37:00-04:00","title":"Virginia Democrats Prepare to Reshape US House Districts in Counter to Trump’s Redistricting Push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Democrats are preparing to redraw congressional districts in a bid to gain more seats and counter President Donald Trump’s push for partisan redistricting in Republican-led states.

The purpose includes congressional redistricting aimed at gaining more Democratic-held seats, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they are not authorized to publicly discuss them.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia would be the second state with a Democratic-led legislature after  California  to enter a national redistricting battle with enormous stakes. If Democrats gain just three more seats, they would take control of the House and effectively impede Trump’s agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers in  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina  already have approved new congressional maps aimed at helping their party win more seats and retain the slim GOP House majority. And even more states are considering redistricting as the battle front widens.\n \n\n   \n  A spokeswoman for Democrats’ House campaign arm characterized the Virginia effort as the party pursuing “every available tool to counter Republicans’ desperate attempts to steal the midterms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia’s decision to convene and preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” said Courtney Rice, communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans vowed to fight. Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said Democrats missed their opportunity to carry out this procedure by 2026 and that it’s “too late constitutionally” to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to do everything legally we can do to stop this power grab,” Kilgore said.\n \n\n   \n  Voting districts typically are redrawn at the start of each decade to account for population changes noted by the census. But Trump took the unusual step over the summer of urging Republican-led states to reshape key districts to try to buck a historical trend of a president’s party losing seats in midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia currently is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans who ran in districts with boundaries imposed by a court after a bipartisan redistricting commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n \n\n   \n  The effort to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts comes in the final weeks before the November 4 state legislative and statewide elections. But Monday’s session is just the start of what could be a long legislative process, running past the election.\n \n\n   \n  Because Virginia’s redistricting commission was established by a voter-approved constitutional amendment, the electorate must sign off on any changes. And any proposed change to the constitution must first pass the legislature in two separate sessions. Democrats are scrambling to hold that first vote this year, so that they can approve the change a second time after a new legislative session begins January 14.\n \n\n   \n  Voters still would have to approve a change in the constitution to allow using the new House map. And that vote would need to occur before congressional primaries, which are currently set for June 16 — though dates for such elections have been pushed back in the past.\n \n\n   \n  In many states, congressional districts are drawn by state lawmakers, subject to the approval of the governor. But North Carolina’s new map, which received final approval Wednesday from the Republican-led Legislature, did not have to go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. Those changes target a swing district held by Democratic US Rep. Don Davis by adding areas that contain more Republican-leaning voters.\n \n\n   \n  Like Virginia,  California  has a constitutionally established redistricting commission, which approved maps after the 2020 census. California voters are to decide in a November 4 election whether to temporarily suspend those districts and instead use a map approved by the Democratic-led Legislature that could help Democrats pick up as many as five additional seats.\n \n\n   \n  No voter approval is necessary for the revised districts in Missouri, North Carolina or Texas, though opponents in Missouri are gathering petition signatures to try to force a statewide vote on their new map.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5586598","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"07:31:00-04:00","title":"Suspects Arrested Over the Theft of Crown Jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two suspects were arrested in connection with a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre museum in Paris, where four men dressed as workmen broke in through a window using a ladder on a moving truck and stole over $100 million worth of 19th-century crown jewels from Emperor Napoleon III’s reign.

The data paints a complicated picture \n         By Odette Yousef \n        \n           Saturday, October 25, 2025 • 7:36 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The assassination of  right-wing activist Charlie Kirk  has turbocharged the conversation — and fears — around political violence in the U.S. And, more than perhaps any other recent high-profile incident, it has fed claims that far-left extremists are primarily responsible for the worsening environment. \"From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on ICE agents, to the vicious murder of a health care executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and three others, radical-left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives,\" President Trump said, just hours after Kirk was killed. So far, no information has been disclosed that clearly links the man charged with Kirk's killing to leftist groups or movements. Still, the Trump administration's claim that domestic terrorism largely comes from the left has flown in the face of data. Federal law enforcement authorities and non-governmental researchers have, for years, found the far right to be the most \"lethal and persistent\" domestic terrorist threat. Among examples they cite are racially motivated mass killings at an African American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, and a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2022; and the 2018 massacre at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh. But a  recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies  (CSIS) posits that a reversal took place in the first half of 2025. It analyzed roughly 30 years of data and found that between Jan. 1 and July 4 of this year, the number of far-left terrorist plots and attacks outnumbered those from the far right. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My hope was to bring some data to the discussion and to try to use the data to understand possible reasons left wing terrorism might be increasing and right wing terrorism might be decreasing,\" said Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at CSIS. Byman co-authored the study with Riley McCabe, an associate fellow in the same program. But the report itself has ignited a firestorm of debate within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research. For many, the conclusions are premature. And ultimately, critics say it does more to reveal the complications around collecting and analyzing data on domestic terrorism than it does to clarify the current state of the problem itself. A claim that left-wing terrorism is rising — but with caveats The CSIS study drew from a variety of sources that included information from the  Armed Conflict Location & Event Data  project, the  Anti-Defamation League  and media reports. Because there is no public, official, unified and comprehensive database of domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S., researchers who wish to analyze trends are required to assemble their own data sets. \"There are a lot of ambiguities for really anyone who's trying to code terrorist attacks,\" said Byman. \"Coding\" refers to a process by which analysts apply sorting criteria to an incident to determine how it should be categorized. In the CSIS analysis, for example, there was the initial requirement to determine whether incidents even qualify as terrorism. \"If someone draws a swastika on a synagogue, do you say that's antisemitic terrorism? We tended to focus on risk of life, so that sort of violence would not count,\" Byman explained. \"In a more political context, the  arson attacks on Tesla  would not count because there doesn't seem to have been any attempt or intent to kill individual people.\" Additional coding happens after analysts compile their lists of domestic terrorism incidents. In this case, Byman and McCabe were interested in focusing on cases that, in their view, could be attributed to right-wing or left-wing motivations. During the first six months of 2025, they coded five instances as left-wing terrorism, and one as right-wing terrorism. But Byman said the significance of these findings has caveats. \"Even the five [left-wing terrorist incidents] we get for the first half of 2025 — let's say that pace continues and it's 10 — that's a small number compared to right-wing terrorism when it was at its peak in recent years,\" Byman said. \"And so the increase to me has to be taken in context.\" In fact, Byman said that while  several   news   outlets  ran with headlines that highlighted a rise in left-wing plots and attacks, that was perhaps the less remarkable finding. \"The decline in right-wing attacks is actually much more striking,\" he said. The single act that the CSIS study coded as right-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025 was the assassination of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of Minnesota state senator John Hoffman and his wife. Byman surmises the drop-off in frequency of right-wing incidents may be due to a feeling that the Trump administration has operationalized policy objectives, such as increased immigration enforcement, that previously animated violence on the right. But several experts within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research have raised concerns about the methodology, conclusions and timing of the study. \"Five is a really low case number\" For Amy Cooter, deputy director at the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, the numbers found in the CSIS study are too small to support any robust conclusions. \"Five is a really low case number to try to make any kind of inference from and try to say that we're having a major increase in any kind of problem,\" said Cooter, who  co-authored a critique  of the report. \"Compared to historical data, almost any increase in left-wing violence is going to look like a big jump.\" By contrast, Byman and McCabe's count of right-wing terrorism tallies 144 incidents between 1994 and 2000. That suggests a rate of 12 incidents per six-month period, more than twice what they found in their analysis of left-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025. \"The primary thing that I'm worried about with that report is how some people are already interpreting that as projecting a real threat from the left, both through the rest of 2025 and through an undefined future period as well,\" Cooter said. \"Not only are five incidents still objectively really small, we know historically we have seen a greater number of incidents that are more reasonably coded as right-oriented.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Beyond the distortions that may come from small numbers, others have raised additional red flags about the study. \"There have been methodological concerns that have been aired with that product,\" said Jacob Ware, research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. \"I think part of the firestorm has been people pointing out individual cases that are included or are not included.\" The study of domestic terrorism is highly subjective From decisions about whether a particular incident should be coded as terrorism, to discerning a perpetrator's ideology or politics, whether those beliefs ultimately motivated the violence, and the extent to which mental health issues factored in — researchers may draw different conclusions. In many cases, those determinations simply cannot be made until court cases begin, and evidence relating to the suspect's background and planning are publicly available. As a result, there's surprising variance when it comes to analyzing domestic terrorism. \"There's a lot of subjectivity that goes into this,\" Cooter said. \"Basically, it's up to teams of researchers deciding their own criteria for what counts or doesn't [in deciding what goes] into a particular dataset.\" For those reasons, Cooter and Ware said they have different assessments about some of the incidents that the CSIS study included — and excluded — in its analysis. \"We really need to get statements or justifications, motivations from perpetrators,\" said Ware. \"I don't think we have that in the Charlie Kirk assassination or the Minnesota assassination.\" The Kirk assassination occurred after the time span that the CSIS analysis examined, but Byman said he considers that killing to be \"a very obvious example\" of an additional act of left-wing terrorism in 2025. Cooter, however, said she believes any coding of the killing, at this juncture, is premature. \"We're still waiting  for more information  on the Charlie Kirk shooting, quite frankly,\" she said. Ware also noted that the CSIS study left off incidents that others might call acts of left-wing terrorism. For instance, it excluded the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in May. Byman said the CSIS is adjusting how it codes violence committed in the name of Palestinian rights because of particular complexities around that issue. The study also left out instances where vandals damaged Tesla vehicles and charging stations. There were several such examples of this during the early months of Trump's second term, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk was heading up the administration's efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"To me, that might qualify as an act of terrorism, if somebody is using incendiary devices against civilian targets for political purposes,\" Ware said. But the study does count the  arson of 11 NYPD squad cars  in June of 2025, a case that Ware said would not necessarily have made his list. Other high-profile instances of violence, including the murder of the CEO of United Healthcare late last year, and two apparent attempted assassinations of Donald Trump in 2024, are further testing frameworks for analyzing domestic terrorism. In the case of the health care executive, the suspect charged with the killing has been celebrated as a kind of folk hero to some on the left. But little is still known about what might have motivated the violence. With the incidents involving Trump, the motives also remain unclear. Byman said it is reasonable and expected that others might arrive at different conclusions about the same events. \"If you're changing your coding to try to be more inclusive or less inclusive, does it change your general trends?,\" he said. \"And my take would be, no, we still see the relative increase in left-wing [terrorism], we still see the significant decrease in right-wing [terrorism], although the particular numbers, I would say, can vary depending on different legitimate coding systems.\" \"Salad Bar Extremism\" Across the field, counterterrorism and extremism researchers largely agree that in recent years, there has been an increase in violence that may be considered domestic terrorism. Many believe the increase has occurred within both the left and the right. And many agree that it is critical to achieve a firmer understanding of the source of the threat. \"If, hypothetically, we see 90% of attacks or plots coming from people of a particular political persuasion, it doesn't make sense to evenly divide our resources across the political spectrum,\" Cooter said, \"because that's not going to pick up on the majority of those potential threats.\" But some experts are questioning whether a left-right framework is sufficient to track the evolving nature of violence in the U.S. Former FBI director Christopher Wray often invoked the term \"salad bar extremism\" to refer to the disjointed assemblage of beliefs that violent actors increasingly seemed to hold. Earlier this year, the FBI established a new coding category called \" nihilistic violent extremism \" to capture a growing phenomenon of non-ideological crimes. And from a lethality perspective, the deadliest incident so far this year occurred on Jan. 1 when a self-radicalized Islamist perpetrator  drove into a crowd  on New Years Day in New Orleans, killing 14 people. Ware said that for him, the shift in domestic terrorism is better defined by a change in who has been targeted. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Terrorism is getting more personal,\" he said. In the past, Ware said, domestic terrorists have tended to aim for higher body counts. He pointed to the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. But recently, Ware said that attacks have been circumscribed to far fewer victims — even when there was the opportunity to kill more. \"I think one of the really strange cases where you see this very strongly was the Washington, D.C., Capital Jewish Museum murders,\" he said. \"[The suspect] executed two people in the street and then entered his target without launching further violence. ... It was almost like he felt he'd already achieved his goal with just those two pointblank, horrendous murders.\" While the CSIS study has set off vigorous discussion and disagreement about the source of terrorism in the U.S., few believe that it will materially impact policy. \"The administration is going after anti-fascist groups or networks, movements. That's not really where the violence is coming from,\" Ware said. \"So even if the findings are correct, that doesn't mean the administration is doing the right thing with those findings.\" In fact, since Trump took office in January, some developments have elevated suspicion that this administration may go farther than simply ignoring data. In September, independent journalist  Jason Paladino wrote  that the Department of Justice appeared to have removed a study that found far-right extremists to be responsible for the most lethal terrorism since 1990. The study is  still available  through The Internet Archive. The DOJ's Office of Justice Programs did not respond to questions from NPR about this. Additionally, in March the Department of Homeland Security  discontinued funding  for the Terrorism and Targeted Violence project at the University of Maryland. That project was the only publicly available centralized data project collecting information about terrorism and targeted violence in the country. Since 2020, that database has provided information used by professionals in areas of homeland security, school safety and violence prevention. In response to an NPR query about the decision to discontinue its funding, a DHS spokesperson said the project had \"biased and misleading data practices.\" It also said it \"disproportionately focused on right-wing ideologies while downplaying left-wing extremism.\" Ultimately, as the administration refocuses from terrorism to counternarcotics operations and immigration enforcement, Ware said Americans are increasingly at risk. \"We are seeing a higher drumbeat of violence across the board and now the onus shifts to the administration to be able to prevent that. And I think that is where the American people should be really concerned,\" he said. \"Whether the violence is coming from the left or the right, the onus is on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent it and to protect the American people. And they are not doing that right now.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   For many years, the far right has been the most lethal and persistent source of domestic terrorism in the U.S., but a new study says violence from the far left has been the greater threat, at least so far this year. NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef looks into this claim. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: President Trump's insistence that the far left has been the primary culprit for domestic terrorism goes back years at this point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'Cause this is not a right-wing problem. JOE BIDEN: His own FBI director said... TRUMP: This is a left-wing problem. BIDEN: ...The threat comes from white supremacists. YOUSEF: That was a 2020 presidential debate when Trump was asked if he would condemn far-right extremist groups. It was also just days after his acting head at the Department of Homeland Security told congressmen that white supremacist extremists were responsible for the most lethal extremist violence. Still, five years later, there is a sense that something is shifting. The nation has seen the killing of Charlie Kirk, the apparent attempted assassinations of Trump, the gunning down of a health insurance executive in New York and more. These events are not clearly coded as right-wing. And so has the violence, in fact, pivoted to the left? DANIEL BYMAN: My hope was to bring some data to the discussion. YOUSEF: Daniel Byman is director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS. Data on domestic terrorism is surprisingly hard to come by. There is no public, official, unified and comprehensive database, so researchers like Byman are assembling databases on their own. He looked at incidents between 1994 and July 4 of 2025. BYMAN: We're seeing, you know, from a low baseline, an increase in left-wing attacks, and we're seeing a decrease in right-wing attacks from much higher numbers. YOUSEF: Byman and his co-author found something remarkable. Their tally showed that in the first half of 2025, far-left terrorist activity had overtaken that from the far right. It's a departure from the pattern of the last 30 years. News outlets ran with that headline. But among many professionals in Byman's field, the surprise has been for a different reason. AMY COOTER: Five is a really low case number to try to make any kinds of inference from and try to say that we're having a major increase in any kind of problem. YOUSEF: Amy Cooter is deputy director at the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism. Five is the number of far-left terrorist plots and incidents that Byman's study tallied during the first half of 2025. It's a small number, but it's bigger than previous time periods, and Cooter says that is exactly what can distort conclusions. COOTER: Compared to historical data, almost any increase in left-wing violence is going to look like a big jump. YOUSEF: Byman acknowledges this. Still, he says the trends are what matter. But Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says there are more questions. JACOB WARE: There have been methodological concerns that have been aired with that product. YOUSEF: This is where the real mess starts. There are a host of subjective calls when it comes to analyzing domestic terrorism. How destructive was the crime? Did people die? Was that by intent? If not, could people have gotten hurt? What was the perpetrator's politics or ideology? Did that motivate the violence? How much fear did the act create? And to what extent did mental health issues factor into the attack? And so some incidents that the CSIS study included and left out have been disputed. Again, Jacob Ware. WARE: Early this year, for example, there were a number of fire bombings at Tesla stores or other Tesla infrastructure. To me, that might qualify as an act of terrorism if somebody is using incendiary devices against civilian targets for political purposes. Those don't seem to be counted. YOUSEF: But the study does count the burning of 11 NYPD squad cars among its five left-wing terrorist incidents of 2025. Ware says that one wouldn't make his cut. Another instance that raises questions involved an individual arrested by U.S. Capitol Police earlier this year for allegedly plotting to kill Trump cabinet members. The individual reportedly turned herself in to law enforcement before following through. Should that count? Some might say no, but this study included it. What about the killings of two Israeli embassy staffers in May? Those are left off this list. Byman says he understands if others arrive at different conclusions on these, as he calls them, edge cases, but 2 or 3 out of 5 can change whether there is, in fact, a trend. Taking a step back, researchers in this field largely agree that something is shifting. Political violence has increased. There is concern that more may be coming from the left, though many told NPR it's just too early still to know. For Jacob Ware, the left/right framework isn't the best way to understand the change. WARE: Terrorism is getting more personal. YOUSEF: Whether it's the killings of a health care CEO, a Minnesota state lawmaker, Charlie Kirk, Israeli embassy staffers, the arson at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion, attempted assassinations of Trump, Ware says this is different from the past. Historically, domestic terrorists in the U.S. have sought a large body count. But in recent cases, Ware says perpetrators or suspects haven't done that even in situations where they could have killed more people. And he says the question of whether their violence stemmed from far-left or far-right tendencies is, more often than not, unclear. WARE: We really need to get statements or justifications, motivations from perpetrators. And I don't think we have that in the Charlie Kirk assassination or the Minnesota assassination, and so I would argue there's a world in which neither of those people should be coded as terrorists. I mean, they're clearly assassins, but I just don't think we have the information yet that would allow us to code them as terrorists. YOUSEF: Ideally, a data-based understanding of who is committing domestic terrorism, how and against whom would help law enforcement allocate resources toward the greatest threats. But as the Trump administration continues to ramp up its efforts against its political opposition, Ware and Byman both say any data are unlikely to shift that agenda. Odette Yousef, NPR News.

    \nUpdated: \n        11:03 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Andrew Cuomo kept up a late-campaign effort to raise fears about the Muslim faith of Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, even laughing Thursday at the suggestion that Mamdani would cheer a terror attack like 9/11 were it to happen again.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo, the former New York governor running an independent bid after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary, chuckled as radio host Sid Rosenberg, who has previously called Mamdani an “animal” and a “jihadist,” closed out a segment by calling Mamdani a “terrorist.”\n \n\n   \n  “God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?” Cuomo posited.\n \n\n   \n  “He’d be cheering,” Rosenberg responded.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo paused and laughed along, adding, “That’s another problem.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments, made just days before New Yorkers cast their ballots, was the latest invocation by Cuomo of Mamdani’s Muslim faith and background.\n \n\n   \n  In the last days before the November 4 general election, Cuomo has repeatedly focused on Mamdani’s religion, arguing he was betraying Islam by supporting the decriminalization of sex work while also suggesting that Mamdani would betray New York City on matters of public safety and terrorism as he appeals to moderates and conservatives as well as Jewish voters concerned about  Mamdani’s criticism of Israel .\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he believed Cuomo was making Islamophobic statements against him, Mamdani replied with “yes.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it’s also disgusting,” Mamdani told reporters Thursday. “Andrew Cuomo’s message is to smear and slander the first Muslim candidate on the verge of leading this city where 1 in 8 New Yorkers are Muslim and say that by virtue of your faith you are worthy of suspicion.”\n \n\n   \n  Among the Democrats who ripped Cuomo’s comments was US Rep. Ritchie Torres, who has  been a sharp critic  of Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “It should be possible to critique a candidate’s ideas without demonizing the candidate himself,” Torres  wrote  on X. “To insinuate that a mayoral candidate would celebrate a second 9/11 is beyond disgusting and disgraceful. We all have a responsibility to lower the temperature and to restore a measure of civility to our public discourse.”\n \n\n   \n  In one mayoral debate, Cuomo tore into Mamdani, who is a Shia Muslim, by referencing Sunni Muslims and saying Mamdani had ideas that were “haram,” or forbidden. The Shia-Sunni split dates nearly to the founding of Islam and has often animated religious and political tensions among Muslims.\n \n\n   \n  “To Zohran, I believe you have been a divisive force in New York, and I believe that’s toxic energy for New York,” Cuomo said. “It’s with the Sunni Muslims when you say decriminalize prostitution, which is haram.”\n \n\n   \n  Standing next to Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday hours after his radio interview, Cuomo nodded as Adams appeared to suggest Mamdani’s election would usher in Islamic extremism to New York.\n \n\n   \n  “New York can’t be Europe, folks,” Adams said “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism, not Muslims. Let’s not mix this up.”\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday night’s debate, the Cuomo campaign posted and then quickly deleted an AI-generated video to social media, showing a fake version of Mamdani using his hands to shove rice into his mouth as a voiceover warned about Mamdani’s “radical” ideas.\n \n\n   \n  “The video was a proposal that wasn’t approved, wasn’t finished and didn’t go through the normal legal process,” Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said. “It was posted for five minutes before it was taken down.”\n \n\n   \n  And during the Democratic primary campaign, an anti-Mamdani super PAC that raised millions for Cuomo ran television ads that described Mamdani as “dangerous” by exclusively using footage of him wearing traditional South Asian clothing. Mamdani usually wears a suit when campaigning. Mamdani also accused Cuomo of sending mailers to voters which showed him with a darkened beard.\n \n\n   \n  Zara Rahim, a senior adviser on Mamdani’s campaign, said Cuomo was “trying to define what being Muslim should look like.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has only tried to court Muslim people by saying look at this bad Muslim – that is a desperate tactic from a man who has nothing to say to Muslim people,” Rahim said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo was questioned earlier this year for never having visited a mosque during his nearly 12 years as governor of New York, a state home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the country. Now, his campaign says he’s been to several, sometimes making multiple stops in a single week.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s newfound effort to court the South Asian community was also the topic of intense sparring between Cuomo and Mamdani in the first debate, with Cuomo at one point suggesting Mamdani’s politics are not “representative” of the Muslim community or “follow the Muslim faith.”\n \n\n   \n  A visibly miffed Mamdani responded by pointing out Cuomo hadn’t visited a mosque until after he lost in the Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  “It took me to get you to even see those Muslims as part of this city, and that frankly is something that is shameful,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s campaign also launched an effort called “Hindus for Cuomo,” with visits to Hindu mandirs, or temples, where he decries democratic socialism. And following others’ cues, he’s learned to bow and touch the floor when entering a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship.\n \n\n   \n  Aides to Cuomo believe he may be able to peel away some support among older, more conservative voters who tend to focus on public safety and education. They are hoping Cuomo’s promises to hire more officers and expand the city’s gifted and talented schools could pull some immigrant voters away from Mamdani, who has called for police reforms while disavowing his past calls to defund law enforcement and proposed narrowing gifted programs.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, an immigrant from Uganda, was raised by Indian parents in Manhattan and was 9 years old on September 11, 2001.\n \n\n   \n  He has spoken about how growing up in the post 9/11 world shaped his childhood, echoing a similar story told by thousands of children who were in school the morning of the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  “Zohran grew up in the shadow of 9/11,” Rahim, his senior adviser, said Thursday. “At the end of the day, this is New York City and New Yorkers are very familiar with garden-variety Islamophobia; they see it and reject it.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/asia/myanmar-starlink-scam-centers-spacex-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-04:00","title":"SpaceX disables thousands of Starlink devices being used by Myanmar scam centers","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink internet devices in Myanmar, targeting cyber scam centers along the border with Thailand.

Starlink devices being used by Myanmar scam centers \n       \n  By Helen Regan, Teele Rebane, Kocha Olarn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:20 PM EDT, Thu October 23, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  SpaceX has disabled over 2,500 Starlink devices being used by cyber scam syndicates operating in a lawless corner of Myanmar, the   Elon Musk-led company said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Despite regional authorities’ highly publicized  crackdowns on the cyberfraud centers  along Myanmar’s border with Thailand this year, the scamming networks have continued to proliferate in the civil war-afflicted nation.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX said it works to identify violations in all markets where Starlink operates.\n \n\n   \n  “On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world,” said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX’s vice president of business operations for Starlink, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  “In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers’.”\n \n\n   \n  Dreyer did not provide a date for when the consoles were disabled, but the announcement comes after the Myanmar military junta said it discovered 30 sets of Starlink “receivers and accessories” during a raid on one such scam compound this week.\n \n\n   \n  There are about 30 sprawling, purpose-built compounds dotted along the Myanmar-Thai border that are dedicated to scamming victims, including Americans, out of billions of dollars every year, according to  a recent report  by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  Workers in the scam centers are often lured by the promise of well-paid jobs,  or trafficked, and are routinely held against their will and forced to carry out online fraud schemes in the heavily guarded compounds, where former detainees have  previously told CNN  beatings and torture are common.\n \n\n   \n  For more than a year, concerns have been raised by the United States that criminal networks in Myanmar were using Starlink to access the internet and carry out their scams.\n \n\n   \n  Starlink has more than 6 million global users, according to its website. It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”\n \n\n   \n  The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting  artificial intelligence  and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.\n \n\n   \n  Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.\n \n\n   \n  Kristalyn, from the Phillipines, said she was working in KK Park, a notorious scam compound near Myawaddy, a border town in southeast Myanmar, when the internet was cut at around noon on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “In the morning the Chinese boss came into our office and told us to return to our rooms,” she told CNN, requesting to use only her first name for safety reasons.\n \n\n   \n  “But not long after, he came back in again and told us to just leave the place,” added Kristalyn, who said she had been working there since July.\n \n\n   \n  She and around 200 other Filipinos, along with others from India, Pakistan and several African countries, were waiting near the border with Thailand and trying to cross over, she told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of us are staying in abandoned houses, buildings and even some are just staying on the streets trying to cross the border. We have no food here. We have no money at all.”\n \n\n   \n    Civil war\n \n\n   \n  Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.\n \n\n   \n  In February, Thailand  cut electricity supplies  to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims  were released  from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.\n \n\n   \n  But experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.\n \n\n   \n  The military said Monday its raid on KK Park uncovered more than 2,000 workers.\n \n\n   \n  Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.\n \n\n   \n  But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.\n \n\n   \n  While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound   who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.\n \n\n   \n  Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.\n \n\n   \n  “With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).\n \n\n   \n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive  law enforcement operation  by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.\n \n\n   \n  “It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/india-mf-husain-art-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00.000Z","title":"Why ‘India’s Picasso’ is breaking auction records — and enraging the Hindu right","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the polarizing legacy of M.F.

Husain, one of 20th-century India’s most important artists, this year has been a tale of two auctions.\n \n\n   \n  In March, one of the late painter’s monumental depictions of rural life, the 14-foot-long “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” became the  most expensive  modern Indian artwork ever to go under the hammer. The $13.75 million price tag almost doubled the previous record, with onlookers at Christie’s in New York bursting into spontaneous applause.\n \n\n   \n  Three months later, an auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai was far less celebratory. Police  patrolled the premises  and erected barricades at the auctioneer’s office after a right-wing Hindu nationalist group  warned  of “strong public agitation” if calls to cancel the sale — due to Husain’s “vulgar and obscene” portrayals of sacred figures — were ignored.\n \n\n   \n  The auction went ahead without incident. But the contrasting moods exemplified the painter’s status as one of Indian art’s most celebrated but controversial names. As if to further underscore his polarized reputation, this year also saw a Delhi court order the seizure of two “offensive” Husain paintings, while, earlier this month, the Qatar Foundation announced plans for an entire  museum  dedicated to his work (Qatar had given   Husain citizenship after he fled India, in 2006, fearing for his safety).\n \n\n   \n  Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso.” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics.\n \n\n   \n  The artist’s portrayals of nude Hindu deities, however, stand accused of offending religious sentiments — a reaction his supporters believe is exacerbated by his Muslim heritage. As a result, his later life was dogged by protests, legal action, death threats and an arrest warrant. Despite later being exonerated by India’s supreme court, he died in self-imposed exile, in London, in 2011. In its statement opposing June’s Mumbai auction, right-wing group Hindu Janajagruti Samiti said that Husain “deliberately painted vulgar and obscene images of goddesses … thereby gravely hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The rekindling of old grievances, almost 15 years after his death, may be down to burgeoning interest from the global art market. But reactions to Husain’s work are also a bellwether of Hindu nationalism, according to Dr. Diva Gujral, an art history fellow at the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. While many of his most contentious works were produced in the 1970s, it is no coincidence that protests only erupted in 1990s, a decade when the Hindutva ideology flourished, communal tensions deepened and, Gujral said, Muslims became “a lightning rod” in India.\n \n\n   \n  “The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country.”\n \n\n   \n    Icons past and present\n \n\n   \n  Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age.\n \n\n   \n  He was born in 1915 in Pandharpur, a pilgrimage town dotted with Hindu temples in western India. After his mother’s death, he was sent to study Urdu and Islamic calligraphy at his grandfather’s madrassa in  Sidhpur , Gujarat. Husain later lived in the city of Indore and immersed himself in folk traditions, like performances of the Hindu epic “Ramayana,” before enrolling in art lessons at the local art institute. In 1934, he sold his first painting on a roadside for 10 rupees.\n \n\n   \n  His interest in iconography always stretched far beyond religion. In his early 20s, Husain moved to Mumbai to paint billboards for the nascent Hindi film industry. It would prove a formative experience — one that shaped his fascination with contemporary idols and Bollywood, as well as his penchant for vivid colors and flattened, figurative forms.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 1947, came another decisive moment in the artist’s life: India’s independence from colonial rule and Britain’s partition of the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Partly inspired by the religious strife that ensued, the painter co-founded the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), alongside major figures like F.N. Souza and S.H. Raza, later that year.\n \n\n   \n  The avant-garde group sought to forge a new visual language of — and for — India. Rejecting revivalist nationalism, its members fused local art traditions with outside influences, especially those of European modernists like Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse (though Husain also traveled to China in the early 1950s), as they interrogated their country’s emerging identity.\n \n\n   \n  “It was about creating something new, breaking with the past,” said Gujral adding that the group did more than “simply take” from Western art. “They’re reinvigorating a language that’s made available to them through access to places like London and Paris. But it’s very much their own thing.”\n \n\n   \n  For Husain, this meant a Cubist-inspired style rooted firmly in the Indian experience. It is an approach epitomized by the record-breaking “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” which he produced in 1954, though it went largely unseen for seven decades before going on sale at Christie’s this year. The narrative painting comprises 13 vibrant vignettes, each containing a snippet of rural life. Abstracted villagers are depicted working the land, milling grain and tending to livestock. Elsewhere, a farmer symbolically reaches out of his portrait’s frame to hold up a landscape in a neighboring vignette.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  As many of Husain’s contemporaries moved overseas (including Souza and Raza, who relocated to the UK and France, respectively), the painter remained in India, his eternal muse. He nonetheless enjoyed some global recognition, exhibiting in New York City in 1964 and participating in the 1971 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil alongside Picasso. This period also saw Husain exploring female forms, including images of Hindu goddesses like Durga and Lakshmi, sometimes in suggestive or erotic poses.\n \n\n   \n  Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujral.\n \n\n   \n  “In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”\n \n\n   \n  “It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”\n \n\n   \n    Fundamentalist reprisals\n \n\n   \n  The entire 1980s passed before the paintings faced significant religious backlash. In that time, Husain was even welcomed into the political establishment as a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where he served until 1992.\n \n\n   \n  But everything changed in the fall of 1996, when a Hindu monthly magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published the artist’s nude depiction of the goddess Saraswati alongside an article headlined “M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher.” The incident led to multiple  criminal complaints  against Husain, who was then aged in his early 80s, beginning a chain of events that led to his self-imposed exile.\n \n\n   \n  In 1998, Hindu fundamentalists attacked Husain’s Mumbai home and galleries displaying his work. Eight years later, another hardline group offered a 510-million-rupee (then $11.5 million) cash reward for his murder. The protests stretched beyond India’s borders, too, with London’s Asia House controversially canceling an exhibition of Husain’s work in 2006, citing security concerns, after Hindu groups demanded its closure and vandals defaced two of his paintings.\n \n\n   \n  That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.\n \n\n   \n  Concerned for his safety and facing hundreds — or as he  later suggested,  thousands — of legal cases, Husain left India in 2006. The Delhi High Court and, later, India’s Supreme Court eventually rejected calls for Husain’s summons and cleared him of obscenity charges, effectively quashing cases in other cities. In its ruling, in 2008, the Supreme Court criticized the emergence of a “new puritanism” in India, stating that erotic sculptures were a common sight in Hindu temples. Yet, Husain never felt it was safe to return to the country again.\n \n\n   \n  His plight meanwhile became a rallying cry for supporters of Indian secularism. Novelist Salman Rushdie was among those to  criticize  the Indian government for its “inadequate” protection of Husain and the freedom of expression he represented. “Violence and its ugly sisters, both Hindu and Islamic, have to be resisted,” Rushdie said at an address in Delhi in 2010. “They must be rebuffed. To appease it is the best way to ensure their growth. I am afraid India is going that way.”\n \n\n   \n  Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”\n \n\n   \n  He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”\n \n\n   \n    Master showman\n \n\n   \n  Husain’s goddess paintings were just a fraction of his life’s work. Even the most conservative estimates put his total output at 30,000 to 40,000 artworks, spanning printmaking, writing and filmmaking of both the arthouse and Bollywood variety. He was similarly prolific after leaving India: In 2007, he completed 51 paintings inspired by the Bollywood classic “Mughal-e-Azam,” and was, at the time of his death, working on a series of 99 artworks, reflecting the 99 names of Allah, telling the history of Arab civilization.\n \n\n   \n  “He needed to paint all the time,” said Poddar, who first met Husain as the artist waited for a lift, without shoes, at a Kolkata bus stop in the early 1980s. (The 57-year-old collector, then a teenage art enthusiast, approached Husain after recognizing his flowing white beard from a weekly magazine, and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship.) “I once saw him at his London property where he had between 25 and 30 works. I met him again two or three days later, and lo and behold, there were another 12 or 13.”\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.\n \n\n   \n  Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.\n \n\n   \n  “He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know anybody who doesn’t have a Husain story,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujral described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.\n \n\n   \n  Poddar meanwhile argued that his fiercely secular friend treated Hindu icons the same as all his other subjects. In fact, Husain was also accused of blasphemy by Islamic groups over a song in his 2004 movie “Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities,” as its lyrics used words directly from the Quran.\n \n\n   \n  “If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think he ever had an anti-Hindu agenda,” he added. “Ever.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95116","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"18:07:00-04:00","title":"Trump Threatens Canada with 10% Extra Import Tax Over Anti-Tariffs Ad","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced a proposed 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods in response to an anti-tariff television ad aired by Ontario during the World Series.

The ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, angering Trump  who said he would end trade talks with Canada . Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday night during the first game of the World Series. \"Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia. \"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.\" It was not immediately clear when the 10% hike would come into effect, nor whether it would apply to all Canadian goods. Canada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Many Canadian products have been hit with a 35% tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50%. Energy products have a lower rate of 10%, while other goods covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement are exempt. That trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it. Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against tariffs. Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that  could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs , a key part of his economic strategy. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5586583","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"03:41:00-20:00","title":"Trump attends ceasefire ceremony with Thailand and Cambodia during Malaysia visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his visit to Malaysia, U.S. President Donald Trump attended a ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia, where the two nations agreed to a truce after months of border fighting.

By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, October 26, 2025 • 3:41 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement on Sunday during a ceremony attended by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart. \"We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done,\" Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a \"historic day,\" and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates \"the building blocks for a lasting peace.\" The ceremony was Trump's first event after arriving at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur. The trip, which will continue with visits to Japan and South Korea and a potential meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is an opportunity for Trump to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker at a time when his tariffs have scrambled the international economy and he's feuding with Democrats over a government shutdown back home. Trump touched down in the Malaysian capital shortly before 0200 GMT, where he performed his trademark campaign trail dance with local performers and waved an American flag in one hand and a Malaysian flag in the other. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The president signed economic agreements with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The U.S. wants to rely less on China, which has limited exports of key components in technology manufacturing. \"It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,\" said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Trump reengages with a key region of the world The president attended this summit only once during his first term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January. But this year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with a collection of nations that has a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people. \"The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,\" Trump said. He described his counterparts as \"spectacular leaders\" and said, \"everything you touch turns to gold.\" The summit also allowed Trump to play global peacemaker with Thailand and Cambodia, which have competing territorial claims that result in periodic violence along their border. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people, some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries. Trump threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped in a display of economic leverage credited with spurring negotiations. A shaky truce has persisted since then. \"The fact that Trump was holding the tariff card was actually very, very significant,\" said Ou Virak, president of Phnom Penh's Future Forum think tank. \"That's probably the main reason, if not the only reason, but definitely the main reason why the two sides agreed immediately to the ceasefire.\" Now, he said, \"there's a ceremony for Trump to be in front of cameras\" so he can be \"seen as the champion that brings an end to wars and conflicts,\" giving him \"more ammunition for his bid for Nobel Peace Prize.\" Trump has explicitly campaigned for the honor, continuously adding to a list of conflicts that he either helped resolve or claims to have ended. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia during opening remarks at the summit, saying, \"it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.\" Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura described the deal on Saturday as a \"joint declaration\" that will show Thailand and Cambodia \"are committed to renewing their relations.\" \"It's not an end in itself,\" Nikorndej said. \"Work has just begun.\" Tariffs are in focus on Trump's trip Trump is expected to sit down with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva while he's in Kuala Lumpur, but not Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. leader is angry with Canada because of a television ad protesting his tariffs, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would hike tariffs on Canada because of it. Another trade war is front and center on Trump's trip — this one, with China. Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that he was optimistic his meeting with Xi, expected to take place in South Korea, could yield progress on a range of issues. Fentanyl trafficking and soybean sales are among Trump's priorities. \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,\" Trump said. \"I want our farmers to be taken care of. And he wants things also.\" It remains to be seen whether Trump's dealmaking addresses longstanding issues or puts them off for another day. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Sunday that Washington and Beijing could step back from their confrontation instead of pushing forward with higher tariffs by America and export restrictions on rare earth elements by China. When asked if the two countries could extend the trade truce from earlier this year, Bessent said: \"I would say yes.\" However, he emphasized that the final decision would be up to Trump. Trump has expressed confidence about the prospect of finalizing trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, two longstanding allies and trading partners, during the trip. \"We have deals with a lot of people and they're very good deals,\" he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. One leader who was absent from the summit in Kuala Lumpur is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during his first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5584170","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"In the rural South where Medicaid has been a lifeline, residents brace for cuts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In rural Louisiana, particularly in East Carroll Parish, residents have long relied on Medicaid expansion — implemented in 2016 — to access essential health care.

Its seat, Lake Providence, was once a thriving agricultural hub of the region. Now, charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry. Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, remembers a time when \"you couldn't even walk down the street\" in Lake Providence's main business district because \"there were so many people.\" \"It's gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,\" said Amacker, a Democrat. \"The town, it looks like it's drying up.\" Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more with the pending cutbacks to Medicaid, which covers many low-income people in the region. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana's uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to  state data , despite it having the  highest poverty rate  in the U.S. that year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       State health data show the number of people on Medicaid in East Carroll Parish increased from about 53% in  2015  to about 64% in  2023 , according to state health data. Many now worry those gains in coverage could disappear. The tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer includes  nearly $1 trillion  in cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals. Researchers from Princeton University  estimate  that 317,000 low-income Louisianans could lose health coverage because of the new law. More than 30,000 Mississippians too; that state has refused to expand Medicaid. The tax and spending law now imposes new work reporting requirements on Medicaid expansion enrollees and will make them  verify eligibility  every six months, instead of yearly. This requirement, among others, won't kick in until 2027, after the midterm elections. It also limits a key financing strategy — known as a  provider tax  — that states rely on to give more money to health providers. Nationwide, about  10 million  people are expected to become uninsured over ten years because of the law, according to the  Congressional Budget Office . Across the deep South, Louisiana was the only state that expanded Medicaid. \"The way I've described this [law] right now is we know there's a hurricane out in the Gulf,\" said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association. \"We don't know exactly what the category of the storm is going to be at landfall. But we know we need to be prepared for it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Struggling rural communities brace for impact In the Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, the impacts are expected to be damaging. Louisiana, where  almost half of the state  depended on Medicaid in 2023, could lose up to $34 billion in federal Medicaid dollars in the next decade,  according  to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi could lose up to $4 billion. \"The physician community spoke out pretty heavily against this,\" said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at Delta Health System in Greenville, Mississippi, about 50 miles northeast of Lake Providence, across the river. \"The fact that it still went though…was a real sense of disconnect with what our legislators are doing and what we as a health care community feel like is the reality on the ground.\" Residents of the Delta say they feel similarly distraught and are wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling. \"Why do you wanna knock someone who doesn't have anything and you already got everything,\" said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage. \"It's gonna be real difficult when [the law] goes into effect.\" Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for 25 years. She says it's one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month. Her job offers health benefits, but she can't afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure. She said the new work reporting requirements are completely unfair, and she's worried she will accidentally lose her Medicaid. \"My coworkers are talking about it every day,\" Ervin said. \"A lot of people probably won't even know until they go to the doctor and they don't have any coverage.\" In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour. \"We have one bank. We have one supermarket,\" Brown said. \"Transportation isn't easy either.\" Even a full-time job doesn't guarantee health care coverage. Nevada Qualls, 25, earns $12 an hour, working as a cashier at city hall in Lake Providence. She qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can't afford the premiums for private insurance. Because of the new Medicaid law, the mom-of-two will have to work extra hard to keep her coverage. Qualls will face regular work reporting requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, as well as the  quarterly wage checks  that Louisiana Medicaid already conducts. \"It's going to be stressful,\" Qualls said. \"It's another thing to add to my load that is already heavy.\" A massive burden for states  States will be required to  implement work requirements  by Jan. 1, 2027, giving them less than a year-and-a-half to build a reporting system and raise awareness among enrollees. Depending on how Louisiana's work reporting system functions, researchers  estimate  up to 357,000 people could lose coverage. The law will now  require adults  who get Medicaid through expansion to prove they are working or volunteering for 80 hours a month or going to school part-time to keep their coverage, unless they qualify for an exemption. But, data show most Medicaid enrollees are already working,  KFF reports . When Arkansas implemented Medicaid work requirements in 2018 — the first state to do so before a court struck it down — about  18,000 people  were disenrolled in less than a year, many for 'paperwork' reasons, says Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. And there was no evidence that work requirements had a positive impact on employment, he said. \"We are leveling this bureaucratic red tape on people, the vast majority of whom are already doing the things that we supposedly want them to do,\" Sommers said. Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana, said it will be a \"really big lift\" for states to administer the new Medicaid work reporting systems. \"The hope is that [Louisiana] really engages with people on the ground, as well as with community-based organizations that work with people who are covered by Medicaid to create a system that actually works,\" Foster said. \"Let's make sure that we can mitigate as much harm as possible.\" Mississippi is also getting ready, said Roberson at the Mississippi Hospital Association. Without Medicaid expansion, the state's enrollees won't be subject to work requirements, but the law's financing changes to the Medicaid program could strip hundreds of millions of dollars away from hospitals, said Roberson. 'Why are we going back?' The law did create a $50 billion rural health fund, meant to offset spending cuts and help keep rural hospitals open. Roberson said Mississippi is applying and believes the state will be awarded at least $500 million over five years. But if those funds don't make it to struggling hospitals, they could either close or significantly cut back services, he said. From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton, who oversees The Family Medical Clinic in Lake Providence, doesn't understand the attacks on Medicaid. The community health center is one of the few providers in town, and half of its patients are on Medicaid. Newton, who has worked in health care in the area for decades, saw first-hand how Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to afford the care they desperately needed. \"It's absolutely helped,\" she said. \"Absolutely.\" In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in  East Carroll Parish  was nearly  35% . By 2021, that number was 12.7%. \"Why are we going back?\" Newton asked. \"We've made so much progress.\" This story was produced as part of a collaboration between Public Health Watch and  Stateline , which is part of  States Newsroom .

6:31 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Hurricane Melissa has intensified into a category 4 hurricane, and could develop further to become a category 5 as it approaches Jamaica, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane is likely to bring life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to parts of the island nation — where a hurricane warning is in effect — as well as to southern Hispaniola, which is made up of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. A hurricane watch has been issued in Haiti, from its Eastern border with the Dominican Republic to the capital of Port-au-Prince.  The category 4 hurricane was moving at five miles per hour Sunday morning, with increased maximum sustained wind speeds reaching up to 140 miles per hour.  The storm's slow movement is expected to bring a deluge of rain to parts of the Caribbean, and prolong its dangerous impacts over a period of several days. During a press briefing on Saturday, Jamaican officials said time was running out for residents to prepare for the storm. Evan Thompson, Director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, warned Melissa could be worse than previous major storms that battered the island, such as   Hurricane Wilma   in 2005. \"It's going to sit there pouring water while it's barely moving. And that is a significant challenge that we have to be aware of,\" said Thompson. \"It's going to cause significant, widespread, catastrophic, life-threatening floods, as long as what is predicted does take place.\" The National Hurricane Center forecasts Melissa is likely to reach the southern coast of Jamaica Tuesday morning, and urged Jamaicans to seek shelter now. The center is forecasting 15-30 inches of rain in Jamaica and parts of southern Hispaniola into midweek. Some local areas in the region could see as many as 40 inches of rain. Jamaica Information Service (JIS) said the island's National Water Commission   fully activated its emergency protocols . Hospitals, children's homes, and correctional facilities will be prioritized for water transported by truck if Jamaica's water supply is disrupted. JIS also warned residents to be aware that floods may displace crocodiles from water ways. At least one person has been killed in the Dominican Republic as a result of the intense rainfall. Three are reported dead in Haiti from a landslide and falling tree. In southwestern Haiti, the National Hurricane Center describes potential flash flooding and landslides as catastrophic and life threatening. Forecasters are urging eastern Cuba, the Southeast Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos Islands to monitor Hurricane Melissa closely.  The U.S. Navy ordered non-essential personnel and families to evacuate the base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on Saturday. Hurricane conditions are expected in eastern Cuba Tuesday into Wednesday. Rainfall totals could reach more than a foot. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5586593","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"Shooting leaves 1 dead and 6 hurt at historically Black university's homecoming fest in Pennsylvania","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A shooting at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania resulted in one death and six injuries during a homecoming celebration at the International Cultural Center.

But for more than 80 years, the White House movie theater was mostly a place where the first family and their guests went for entertainment. Demolition  began this week of the White House Family Theater — along with the rest of the White House's East Wing where the snug, shoe-box-shaped auditorium was located — to make way for a new $300 million ballroom. It marks the end of an era in American movie theater history. Since its conversion from a cloakroom by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the private, 40-ish-seat theater has screened everything from newsreels and documentaries to westerns and musicals. It has been through several facelifts, most recently ditching cream and red floral curtains, and beige walls and seating for all-round \" movie-palace red \" ornamented with gold molding and dark wood trim following a renovation overseen by first lady Laura Bush in 2004. \"The best perk of the White House is not Air Force One or Camp David or anything else, it's the wonderful movie theater I get here,\" then-President Bill Clinton told film critic Roger Ebert in a 1999  interview . Jimmy Carter was also a big fan. In a single term, the 39th president screened  at least 400 films  between this venue and Camp David, starting with  All the President's Men  — a movie about the Watergate scandal — soon after he was sworn in. Richard Nixon saw  Patton , about the controversial World War II Gen. George S. Patton, multiple times during the Vietnam War. Barack Obama's many screenings at the theater ranged from  Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom  and  Selma  to  Julie & Julia  and  Star Wars Rogue One.  President Trump's picks have included  Finding Dory  and  Sunset Boulevard . John F. Kennedy, who loved James Bond movies, saw  From Russia With Love  the day before he was assassinated in 1963. Not all U.S. presidents were film buffs. According to a 1997  New York Times  interview  with Paul Fischer, who served as the White House's projectionist from the 1950s to the '80s, Lyndon B. Johnson slept through most screenings. (Fischer kept careful logs of all of the movies shown at the theater. A sample from Kennedy's White House years can be seen  here .) \"It was a place for the president to watch what America was watching,\" said Matt Lambros, who authored  several books  about historic movie theaters, in an interview with NPR. \"To have it destroyed is bulldozing a piece of American history.\" The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment, nor confirm  reports from other media outlets  about plans to build a new movie theater as part of the East Wing's redevelopment. \"We're just going off of their word that a theater will be rebuilt,\" said Lambros. \"I hope that's the case, and the next hundred years of presidents can enjoy it.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5585741","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"14:07:00Z","title":"First, came the Louvre heist.

  First, came the Louvre heist. Then came the memes \n         By Rebecca Rosman \n        \n           Saturday, October 25, 2025 • 2:07 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PARIS —   It was the heist heard around the world. So naturally, it was only a matter of hours before it transitioned into memes seen around the internet. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Four masked thieves. Nine \"priceless\" pieces.  All stolen in less than seven minutes , from the world's most famous museum. The Oct. 19 daylight robbery at the Louvre has already been compared to a Dan Brown novel or the latest installment in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's   film franchise. Now it's something else entirely — internet culture's newest obsession. From brands to influencers to actors with projects to promote (here's looking at you, George Clooney), the Louvre heist has become the latest template for going viral. The Paris prosecutor said on Sunday that a number of suspects have been arrested over the theft. The prosecutor said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Roissy Airport. One twist came earlier this week when Empress Eugénie's diamond-and-gold encrusted crown — one of the stolen items — was found damaged near the scene, apparently dropped or abandoned during the thieves' escape. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Eight other jewels — all relics of France's imperial history — remain missing. The estimated value of the items is $102 million (88 million euros), though France's interior ministry described the jewels as \"priceless.\" France's culture minister called the theft a \"humiliation.\" The museum's director admitted that the heist \"was not inevitable,\" acknowledging the failure of its security. The Louvre's protection systems are expected to face more scrutiny in the coming weeks, particularly as questions grow about the lack of security cameras in the museum's Apollo Gallery, where the robbery took place. Turning crime into content The thieves entered the second-floor gallery via a window using an electric lift — which they also used to scurry back down to ground level before jumping on scooters toward the nearest highway. On Friday, Böcker, the German machinery company that made the lift entered the conversation,  releasing a cheeky post  featuring an ad across its social media pages. The ad features a photo of its ladder propped against the Louvre's façade with the caption, \"If you're in a hurry, Böcker Agilo carries up to 400 kg of treasures at 42 m per minute — as quiet as a whisper.\" It was part ad, part wink. Suddenly, the family-run company's longtime slogan \"my way to the top\" has gained new meaning. They weren't alone. IKEA Switzerland posted  its own tongue-in-cheek ad  promoting a glass-dome display case. The caption read: \"Won't protect your crown jewels either. But it will give them the right spotlight.\" Others on TikTok and Instagram have turned the Louvre heist  into a Halloween costume : think black jumpsuits, leather gloves, sleek sunglasses, and glittering imitation jewels. \"Heists are so back!\" the  fashion influencer @clothesfordinner  declared \"How nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre\" Part of the fascination comes from the fantasy the story invites. \"How thrilling, upon hearing the news, to put oneself in the shoes of the thieves, and imagine making off with the diamonds scot-free,\"  The Atlantic  staff writer Caity Weaver  wrote in a recent piece  chronicling the public's obsession with the heist. Or to put the obsession even more simply: \"How   nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre.\" The stolen trinkets, Weaver writes, \"have garnered far more attention now than they would have had they remained on view at the Louvre for 5,000 years.\" Perhaps she's onto something. And perhaps that's why Hollywood, for its part, couldn't resist the moment, either. George Clooney — who plays master thief Danny Ocean in the  Ocean's  franchise —  joked at a film premiere  last week, \"They seem to have done a pretty good job of getting away with it … I was very proud of those guys.\" Asked whether the heist might inspire the  upcoming  Ocean's 14  film , Clooney quipped, \"I think we should rob the Louvre.\" And then there's the dapper man the internet has decided is on the case. After the robbery, an Associated Press photographer captured a young looking  well-dressed passerby  near the Louvre's gates — coat, tie, and fedora — as police sealed off the museum. Online, he was instantly dubbed \"a more dashing version of the famed Inspector Clouseau\" from the Pink Panther franchise, supposedly a suave detective investigating the theft. The AP photographer, Thibault Camus, later said the man was simply walking past. \"He appeared in front of me, I saw him, I took the photo,\" Camus says. \"He passed by and left.\" Still, the image took off, racking up millions of views and a flood of memes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even the Paris prosecutor's office seemed to play along. In a reply to AP regarding whether the mystery man was a part of the official investigation, officials replied with a wink: \"We'd rather keep the mystery alive ;).\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting performances by musicians in a home-based, intimate setting, offering a unique and accessible form of live music entertainment.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Live Music","Music Performance","Intimate Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581354","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:13:00-04:00","title":"Ongoing shutdown threatens food aid for 42 million people","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal government shutdown threatens to cut off food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s largest anti-hunger program.

SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,\" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. \"If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.\" For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies.\"The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month,\" he says. In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of  running out of money . The Trump administration  tapped $300 million in tariff funds  to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll  help fill that funding gap , but not all have the resources for that. There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold \"until further notice.\" The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree  to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act  to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\" Undocumented immigrants  are not eligible  for the Affordable Care Act. Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. \"SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called  contingency reserves ,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program. Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation. The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, \"We would be in uncharted territory.\" And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to  new work requirements  tied to the benefit   starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end. The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to  push 2.4 million people off the program  over the next decade. States and food banks are scrambling to help In a  letter Thursday ,  the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than  250,000 food retailers  count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America. It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards. Meanwhile, states are  preparing for a spike  in demand at  food banks . Virginia, for example, declared a  state of emergency  and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor  urged people to donate  to food banks, and California said it would   send National Guard troops  to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic. But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding. Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But \"there's nothing I can do to make money,\" she says. \"I'm not in the greatest of health.\" For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The federal government shutdown now threatens the country's largest anti-hunger program, known as SNAP. Here's White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: If Democrats continue to hold Americans hostage, there will not be enough funds to provide SNAP benefits for more than 40 million Americans on November 1. That is next week. CHANG: A disruption like that has never happened before. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the fallout would be widespread. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Shari Jablonowski is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. The 66-year-old widow lives near Pittsburgh and raised her nephew and two nieces as her own. Even without this looming crisis, her budget's a tightrope. This month... SHARI JABLONOWSKI: I ran short because I didn't have enough to pay all the bills. LUDDEN: She skipped gas and electric to make her car payment. JABLONOWSKI: Because if I don't pay them, I can't go to the doctors, I can't go to visit my mother, go see her and check on her. LUDDEN: So if her nephew's food benefit disappears in November, for sure it would ruin Thanksgiving, but she really worries the family won't have heat as temperatures drop. JABLONOWSKI: I don't have propane heaters. I have an electric heater, and if the electric goes out, we're screwed. LUDDEN: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 people in the U.S., who get on average $186 a month. JOEL BERG: The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities. LUDDEN: Joel Berg is CEO of Hunger Free America. BERG: If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression. LUDDEN: For most poor people, he says, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was slashed in the '90s, and Medicaid goes to doctors, hospitals and drug companies. BERG: The only thing that really helps moderate-income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program, and that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month. LUDDEN: On top of this, another nutrition program may also run out. WIC helps 7 million pregnant women and new parents. The Trump administration shifted funding to last a few weeks, and some states say they have money for WIC. But it's harder with SNAP because it's so huge - $8 billion a month. Even amping up food banks can nowhere near make up for that, so there's pressure on the Agriculture Department to keep it going. KATIE BERGH: Not just that they can, but they must do this. LUDDEN: That's Katie Bergh - no relation to Joel - with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. She argues there's a legal requirement to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program. Plus... BERGH: SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called contingency reserves that could fund the bulk of what is needed for November benefits. Situations like this are precisely why Congress provides them. LUDDEN: She says the Trump administration could also shift other money like it's done to help WIC. The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR query about whether it has a legal obligation to keep funding SNAP. In a statement, a spokesperson blamed Democrats for risking food aid by keeping the government shut down. Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she could bring in more money if her nephew's food aid disappears. JABLONOWSKI: I'm not in the greatest of health. I can't stand on my feet 24/7. LUDDEN: For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing it for later.

EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump is headed to Asia for a nearly week-long trip that is scheduled to include a high-stakes meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Korea. The trip will also include visits to Malaysia and Japan; Trump is expected to meet with leaders of those countries, as well. Trump's visit comes during an uncertain time in the region and at home, where a prolonged government shutdown remains unresolved. The U.S. has yet to finalize trade agreements with Japan and Korea, and tensions between the U.S. and China over trade have escalated in recent weeks, though Trump is insisting he'll be able to make a deal with Xi. There was also  a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia . That tension has been simmering for years, but erupted over the summer, leaving dozens of civilians and soldiers dead. Both countries agreed to a ceasefire, in part after Trump threatened them with higher tariffs if the fighting continued. A negotiated peace agreement is supposed to be signed at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Kuala Lumpur. Trump presides over Cambodia-Thailand peace agreement in Malaysia Trump will attend the ASEAN summit for the first time since 2017, where a key component will be presiding over the peace agreement. For several months, the president has been touting his ability to end \"unendable\" wars around the world, including this conflict in Southeast Asia. \"I have ended seven unending wars. They said they were unendable. You're never going to get them solved,\" Trump said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month. \"No president or prime minister, and for that matter no other country, has ever done anything close to that, and I did it in just seven months. It's never happened before. There's never been anything like that.\" A U.S. official who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity said that they don't expect China to participate in the peace agreement signing ceremony because the U.S. doesn't believe China played a \"significant\" or \"consequential\" role in the peace agreement,  though it did take part in the mediations . On Air Force One Friday night, Trump told reporters that the Chinese \"weren't involved\" in the deal but did give credit to Malaysia.  Trump will meet with Japan's new prime minister and talk trade with Korea South Korea has also recently dealt with its own tumult, having recently elected President Lee Jae Myung, after Lee's predecessor declared martial law and was later impeached. Lee has negotiated some framework of a trade agreement with Trump, but details of the deal are yet to be finalized, including  Korea's pledge to invest $350 billion  in the U.S. Trump will meet with Lee while in Korea — the first time the two have met in person since a recent ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia resulted in  the temporary detention of 300 South Korean workers  and shocked Koreans back home. In addition to trade, it's likely that Lee and Trump will also discuss North Korea. Lee recently told  CNN  he hopes Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un can \"engage in dialogue.\" Trump said Friday that he was open to meeting with Kim. \"I had a great relationship with him, and he probably knows I'm coming, right?\" he told reporters. \"But, if you want to put out the word, I'm open to it.\" While in Japan, Trump will sit down with the newly elected  Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi  — the nation's first female prime minister — and he will be hosted by the emperor. Trump will also be making remarks at the USS George Washington at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka. The Trump-Xi meeting might not move the needle Finally, Trump's trip will end with a highly anticipated meeting with Xi on Oct. 30 — though Beijing has not yet confirmed the meeting. There have been months of back-and-forth on tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China that has kept the global economy on edge. Tensions had simmered over the summer when the two countries agreed to de-escalate. But earlier this month, Beijing caught Trump by surprise, announcing a further limit on exports of rare earths minerals, which the U.S. and other countries rely on for military equipment and other technologies. Trump threatened to cancel his meeting with Xi altogether and hike tariffs. \"This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World,\"  Trump posted on Truth Social . \"I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.\" Despite China's recent moves, Trump spoke positively of his relationship with Xi more recently, and said he expects a \"fantastic\" deal with China. Experts, though, say the meeting will likely be a moment for both countries to buy time. \"I'm not sure that either side is fully prepared to climb down from the positions that they've staked out,\" said Ryan Hass, director of the China Center at Brookings, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington. He expects the meeting to result in an extension of the \"trade truce\" the U.S. and China agreed to over the summer to \"allow time and space\" for negotiators to finalize a trade agreement. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95054","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-04:00","title":"U.S. Sends Aircraft Carrier to South America in Major Escalation of Military Firepower","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military is deploying the USS Gerald R.

Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to \"bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media. The USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. One of its destroyers is in the Arabian Sea and another is in the Red Sea, a person familiar with the operation told The Associated Press. As of Friday, the aircraft carrier was in port in Croatia on the Adriatic Sea. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey. Deploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. He faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S. Moving thousands more troops into the region There are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. If the entire USS Ford strike group arrives, that could bring nearly 4,500 more sailors as well as the nine squadrons of aircraft assigned to the carrier. Complicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane. Hours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the attacks that began in early September to at least 43 people. Hegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,\" Hegseth said in his post. \"Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.\" The strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine is smuggled from the world's largest producers, including Colombia. Escalating tensions with Colombia, the Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. U.S. focus on Venezuela and Tren de Aragua Friday's strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities. While not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela. On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Maduro argues that the U.S. operations are the latest effort to force him out of office. Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along about 1,200 miles of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack. In the span of six hours, \"100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary,\" Maduro said during a government event shown on state television. The U.S. military's presence is less about drugs than sending a message to countries in the region to align with U.S. interests, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region. \"An expression that I'm hearing a lot is 'Drugs are the excuse.' And everyone knows that,\" Dickinson said. \"And I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. So the messaging here is that the U.S. is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don't fall in line.\" Comparing the drug crackdown to the war on terror Hegseth's remarks around the strikes have recently begun to draw a direct comparison between the war on terrorism that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration's crackdown on drug traffickers. President Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11. When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan. \"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead,\" Trump said during a roundtable at the White House. Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details. \"I've never seen anything quite like this before,\" said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan. \"We have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?\" he said. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: \"It's about time.\" While Trump \"obviously hates war,\" he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said. \"I would not want to be in the shoes of any of these narco-cartels.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94482","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"08:27:00-04:00","title":"Drone photo winners will amaze your eyeballs: From a high-up horseman to a holy river","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A selection of winning drone photographs from the Siena Awards highlights the transformative power of aerial photography in revealing both stunning natural and human-made landscapes.

Drone photo winners will amaze your eyeballs: From a high-up horseman to a holy river \n         By Kamala Thiagarajan \n        \n           Saturday, October 25, 2025 • 8:27 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A solitary horseman, illuminated by a beam of light, stands on the snow, surrounded by eerie and jagged mountain peaks. It's an otherworldly image and it raises the question: How did a photographer manage to make such a captivating picture? The answer: Drones! That particular photo, titled \"The Lone Horseman,\" by Dennis Schmelz, a filmmaker based in Germany took top honors in this year's Siena awards, a global competition that celebrates the art of aerial photography captured by drones. The image was made in Cappadocia, Turkey — a mecca for photographers because of its rockscape with \"fairy chimneys.\" Schmelz wanted to capture a different perspective — instead of the tourists and hot-air balloons of summer, he wanted a winter scene when snow covers the rocks.  \"Silence fills the air and the whole region feels timeless and untouched,\" he says. He sent up his drone to photograph a horseman at sunset. \"I noticed a narrow plateau between two large rocks that formed a perfect natural stage. I asked the rider to move right into the center of the frame,\" he says. The final image is a vertical panorama made of two drone photos. Because of the angle, it looks as if the rider is standing on a floating island — but there's a hidden path on the left side that leads up there. \"That's what fascinates me about drone photography — it allows us to discover new perspectives and reveal patterns that are invisible from the ground,\" says Schmelz. That's not to say drones work miracles. \"The shooting angle must be carefully calibrated,\" says Susanna Scafuri, a journalist and photo editor based in Italy and a member of the jury. But the result can be spectacular, she says. And it's not just about the technology, stresses Cornelia Marchis, a German photographer and photo editor based in Milan and another judge this year. She's drawn to photos that offer \"new ways of seeing familiar places\" and \"convey strong information or tell a compelling story.\" Here's a selection of award-winning and highly commended drone photographs from the Global South countries that Goats & Soda covers with one geographic exception — an image from Italy that's so delightful that we couldn't resist including it. Dhaka City, an urban panorama A photographer and creative director based in Barcelona, Fran Arnau made the photograph \"Dhaka, Urban Panorama\" in the capital of Bangladesh in early morning light. The Buriganga River divides the frame in two — on one side, a dense web of buildings and urban life; on the other, the shipyards where boats are repaired, rest or prepare to sail again. \"From the air, this composition reveals a delicate balance between chaos and order,\" says Arnau. \"The vessels line up like geometric shapes on dark water, while the buildings form an earthy, colorful mosaic.\" Arnau merged 12 drone shots into a single panorama. This stitching technique \"allowed me to embrace the full breadth of Dhaka's landscape both its dense vertical growth and its dynamic connection to the river.\" Traditional Boli Khela The image was taken by businessman Mohammad Shahriar Foisal on April 25, 2024, during Abdul Jabbar's Boli Khela — a century-old wrestling tournament held annually in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Founded in 1909 by respected local businessman Jabbar, the event was born at a time of growing resistance to British colonial rule as a way to promote unity, physical strength and cultural identity. Today, Boli Khela draws thousands from across the country and abroad. The matches are intense, with powerful throws and strategic grapples, and the crowd's energy adds to the electric atmosphere. \"I stood near the ring searching for the best spot to launch my drone,\" says Foisal. \"This event has always been close to my heart. I wanted to capture not only the action in the ring but also the spirit of the crowd and the tradition behind it,\" he says. \"This photo is my tribute to the cultural richness and enduring energy of Boli Khela.\" The seaweed road of Fujian Last May, Sarah Wouters, a Dutch travel photographer living in Bangkok, went to the coastal town Xiafu in the Fujian region of China, which is famous for seaweed farming. \"Seaweed is cultivated on long bamboo poles and the farmers use interconnected bamboo stakes that form a flowing S-shape, which we can only see from a high vantage point,\" says Wouters. She flew a drone above the village and started taking pictures, hoping to capture that beautiful symmetry. 15 minutes later, it started to rain. \"I was really lucky to get this winning photo,\" she says. Swallowed — a ship stranded in a dried-out lake. Iranian photographer Mohammad Ataei Mohammadi drove 870 miles from his home in Gonbad Kavus, in the Golestan Province of Iran, to document the severe drought at Lake Urmia. Mohammadi uses drones to capture both beautiful and alarming environmental scenes. Lake Urmia's drought is not solely a natural phenomenon, he says. \"It is the result of a combination of human and climatic factors: mismanagement of water resources, excessive water extraction for agriculture and industry, numerous dams blocking the lake's natural inflow and climate change — including rising temperatures, high evaporation and reduced rainfall.\" The power of this photo lies in its symbolic layers. \"The white salt streaks encircling the ship look like arms pulling it downward, reminding us that if we are not kind to nature, its inner monster awakens and can even consume humanity,\" he says. \"The ship, a symbol of industry, technology, and human presence, now appears small, alone and defeated against the immense, silent power of nature.\" \"Receiving this award is a tremendous honor, but at the heart of this achievement lies deep sadness,\" says Mohammadi. \"Each time the photo is praised, it reminds me of the gradual death of a lake,\" he says. Aarti [offering of light to the gods] under the stars Miami-based photographer Thibault Gerbaldi wanted a a bird's eye view of the Ganges River, where each evening, thousands gather to witness the prayers, fire and chanting that celebrate the river as a source of life and purification. His goal was to show its full scale from above: \"The density of people, the devotion that extends even to the boats far from shore and the extraordinary sense of collective faith.\" he says. The image won first place in the People category of the drone awards. Miniature paradise Here's the photo from Italy that gives us vicarious joy: people relaxing in the hot springs of Cascate del Mulino. Gilad Topaz, a drone photographer from Israel, made the picture at sunset on a cold evening. \"I was very surprised when I got there wearing warm clothes and saw all these people in the water,\" he says. After a few minutes of observing the beautiful springs, he launched his drone. Kamala Thiagarajan is a freelance journalist based in Madurai, Southern India.

Previously, they trained Immigration and Customs enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, were asylum officers and worked for ICE's legal arm. One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year but was among the  initial class of judges fired  before they could start. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The temporary immigration judges include military lawyers from the Marines, Navy, Army and Air Force. Earlier this summer,  the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers  to work for the DOJ. The DOJ  changed  who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge — effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration law experience. Immigration judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported. Their backgrounds have often varied. Some come to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others come to it after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or private practice. Some have no immigration law experience. The new cohort was trained at the EOIR headquarters in Virginia this month and are expected to start hearing immigration cases soon. Immigration courts have continued to operate during the government shutdown. As part of its aggressive immigration policy, the Trump administration has moved fast to increase the rate of arrests of undocumented immigrants, and scale up detention space and deportations. But the rapid pace of arrests has contributed to the backlog of  millions of cases  at immigration courts. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700  judges  at the start of the year. The loss has resulted in immigration cases being delayed as far out as 2029, NPR previously reported, as vacancies increase despite open job postings to fill roles in those courts. Earlier this year, Congress approved a  spending bill  that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199886001","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-24","timeOfPublication":"10:33:00-04:00","title":"The secret to waking up from a nap feeling refreshed (and not groggy)","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article offers practical advice on how to take a refreshing nap without falling into groggy sleep inertia.

Ever woken up from a nap and felt more tired? Or so discombobulated you forgot which planet you were on? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There's a term for that sleepy, almost-drunk feeling — it's called sleep inertia, says  Dr. Seema Khosla , a sleep medicine physician and the host of  Talking Sleep , a podcast from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It's a sign you're overshooting your napping mark. It can slow you down in the short term and potentially sabotage your nighttime sleep in the long run.  To avoid that, you'll need to keep your naps \"consistent, early and brief,\" says  Jade Wu , a sleep medicine specialist and the author of the book  Hello Sleep .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A good, short nap can offer mental health benefits, says Wu. \"It makes us less biased towards negative stimuli and more flexible in our thinking.\"  It can even act as \"a performance-enhancing drug without the drug,\" she adds.  A 2023 study  published in the  British Journal of Sports Medicine  found that athletes who napped had \"more power, faster sprints, more stamina and felt fatigue less quickly.\"  To take the perfect nap — and begin a napping routine that will leave you feeling refreshed — follow these principles.  Take your nap at the same time and place every day  Take a cue from Mediterranean cultures that siesta and take your nap at the same time every day, says Wu. You don't want a \"haphazard\" napping schedule where you sleep \"sometimes early, sometimes late, sometimes short.\"  So pick a time, like after lunch or in between your afternoon meetings, and stick to it.  If you can, use the same sleep environment for your afternoon snooze and be as intentional about your nap space as possible, says Khosla. If you're napping in your car on your lunch break for example, consider bringing a pillow, an eye mask or earplugs to help boost your nap experience. Nap early in the day From the moment you wake up in the morning, sleep pressure builds in your body to push you to fall asleep again at the end of the day, says Khosla. Napping relieves some of that pressure, so it's important that you nap early enough in the day for it to build back up by bedtime.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you follow a conventional nighttime sleep schedule, take a nap between noon and 3 p.m, says Wu. Any later and you might start to encroach on your nighttime sleep.  For people who work nights, Khosla suggests taking a nap at least 6 hours before you sleep. So if you sleep at 5 p.m. to wake up for a 2 a.m. shift, take a nap around 10 a.m. to give yourself enough time to get sleepy again.   Keep your nap short  The experts we spoke to say to keep your naps between 10 minutes to an hour, tops. This principle might be painful if you're a fan of a long, leisurely afternoon snooze.  You want to \"remain in the lighter phases of sleep rather than the deeper phases, where sometimes it's a little bit harder to wake up,\" says Khosla.  If you take a longer siesta, say, a two-hour nap, \"that almost becomes an additional sleep period,\" she adds — which might mean you're engaging in polyphasic sleep, or breaking up the traditional 7- to 9-hour sleep schedule into smaller periods of sleep. That's not necessarily a problem, say the experts, but it's something to be aware of when considering your overall sleep hygiene.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you find yourself falling asleep quickly and dipping into deep sleep with only 30 minutes of napping, \"that's a sign you're not getting enough sleep at night. Your brain is so desperate to get into deep sleep that even a 30-minute nap will get you there,\" says Wu. If this is the case, take steps to prioritize your nighttime sleep.   If you can't nap, set aside some time to rest  Not everyone has the time or the ability to nap everyday, but Khosla says there's still a lot of value in taking an intentional daytime break. \"We still undervalue rest as a society,\" says Khosla.  So even if you don't fall asleep in that 30-minute period you set aside in the early afternoon, you'll still benefit from rest. \"Closing your eyes, checking out from what you're doing and having a little bit of 'me' time – that is OK,\" she says.

remained hidden from public view for more than eight decades sold Friday at auction for 32 million euros (about $37 million), including fees — surpassing expectations but far from the artist's most expensive work ever auctioned. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Painted in July 1943, \"Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)\" depicts Maar in a brightly colored floral hat. Maar, an artist and photographer herself, had been Picasso's partner and muse for about seven years, and the relationship was coming to a painful close. The work was purchased in 1944 and had not been on the market since, remaining in the family collection. The painting, part of Picasso's \"Woman in a Hat\" series, was auctioned at the Drouot auction house in Paris. Auctioneer Christophe Lucien called the final sale, to a buyer in the room, \"an enormous success,\" as well as a very emotional moment. He said the price — 32,012,397 euros after adding buyer fees to the 27-million hammer price — was not only well above estimates but also the highest paid at auction this year for any artwork in France. Lucien called the painting \"a little piece of the story of love\" — albeit a bittersweet one — between Picasso and Maar. She was 29 when she met the artist and quickly became his muse and the model for \"Guernica,\" among other works. He later left her for the younger  Francoise Gilot  and she died at 89, having lived an increasingly reclusive life. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Theirs \"was not a very simple story,\" Lucien said, adding that the painting came at the end of it. \"You see that she was containing tears because she understood that Picasso was leaving her.\" At a preview this week, Picasso specialist Agnès Sevestre-Barbé marveled at how vivid the portrait has remained. \"We have a painting that is exactly as it was when it left the studio,\" she said. \"It wasn't varnished, which means we have all its raw material, all of it. It's a painting where you can feel all the colors, the entire chromatic range.\" \"It's a painting that speaks for itself,\" she added. \"You just have to look at it — it's full of expression, and you can see all of Picasso's genius.\" Previously, Sevestre-Barbé noted, the work had only been seen in a black-and-white photograph. \"We couldn't imagine from this photo that this painting was so colorful, so amazing, really.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Auctioneer Lucien said before the sale that the work was of huge interest across the globe. \"It's being talked about in all the world capitals with a strong art market, from the United States to Asia, and of course through all the major European markets,\" he said. Though selling above expectations, the work was far from the most expensive Picasso work sold at auction. In 2023, the artist's famed \"Femme à la montre\" (\"Woman with a Watch\") — portraying another muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter — sold for $139.4 million, the second most valuable Picasso sold at auction.

Napoleon's army? Scientists find clues in DNA from fallen soldiers' teeth \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Friday, October 24, 2025 • 11:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's  heist at the Louvre .) But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision. \"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries,\" says  Nicolás Rascovan , the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. \"He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early. \"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases,\" says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished. And in a new study published in the journal  Current Biology , Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise. Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts. \"These wars were anything but glamorous,\" says  Michaela Binder , a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. \"For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A rich and bloody history, reconstructed Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and  DNA analyses  conducted nearly a decade ago. But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then. And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died. \"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere,\" says Rascovan. \"So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something.\" Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago. \"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth,\" explains Rascovan. \"So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes. Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men. \"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen,\" he says. \"It's like doing a puzzle.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       'A story of hardship' After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age. \"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data,\" says  Leslie Quade , a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research. She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today. \"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be,\" says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens. These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. \"We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle.\" \"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture,\" she says. It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease. \"Their bones tell a story of hardship,\" says Binder. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95111","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"16:14:00Z","title":"June Lockhart, Beloved Mother Figure from 'Lassie' and 'Lost in Space,' Dies at 100","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"June Lockhart, who passed away at age 100 in October 2025, was a beloved television icon best known for her roles as Ruth Martin in 'Lassie' (1958–1964) and Maureen Robinson in 'Lost in Space' (1965–1968).

Associated Press \n        \n           Saturday, October 25, 2025 • 4:14 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \"Lassie\" or up in the stratosphere in \"Lost In Space,\" has died. She was 100. Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday. \"She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\" he said. \"It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\" The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star. From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \"Lassie.\" From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \"Lost in Space.\" Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos. Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed. \"I must quote Dan Rather,\" she said in a 1994 interview. \"I can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me. \"I love rock 'n' roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding — the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don't go with my image.\" Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \"All This and Heaven Too,\" \"Adam Had Four Sons,\" \"Sergeant York,\" \"Miss Annie Rooney,\" \"Forever and a Day\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\" She also made \"Son of Lassie,\" the 1945 sequel to \"Lassie, Come Home,\" playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor. New life on television When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \"Lassie\" on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show's original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.) Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \"are bigger, the ruff is bigger, they're more imposing looking.\" She added: \"I worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap. \"Lassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\" After six years in the rural setting of \"Lassie,\" Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \"Lost in Space.\" After their mission is sabotaged by a fellow passenger, the nefarious Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), the party bounces from planet to planet, encountering weird creatures and near-disasters that required viewers to tune in the following week to learn of the escape. Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her \"space pie.\" As with \"Lassie,\" Lockhart enjoyed working on \"Lost in Space\": \"It was like going to work at Disneyland every day.\" In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the rural comedy's last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig. The original star, Bea Benaderet, had been diagnosed with cancer and died, also in 1968. A little bit of everything Lockhart remained active long after \"Lost in Space,\" appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera \"General Hospital\" and nighttime soaps, \"Knots Landing\" and \"The Colbys.\" Her film credits included \"The Remake\" and the animated \"Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm,\" for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl. She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\" \"Her true passion was journalism,\" Gregory said. \"She loved going to the White House briefing rooms.\" Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta. Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him. Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children's ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 \"A Christmas Carol,\" playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents. She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay. Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with \"Lassie.\" Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: \"How wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/hormel-recall-frozen-boneless-chicken-food-companies-c89f0739ca69213abe395ae10e8ab4b0","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"21:13:46Z","title":"Hormel Foods Recalls Millions of Pounds of Frozen Chicken After Metal Found in Products","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hormel Foods has issued a nationwide recall of nearly 4.9 million pounds of frozen boneless chicken products, including its Fire Braised chicken, due to the presence of metal fragments found in chicken breast and thigh products.

In an  interview with the BBC  posted Saturday, Harris said she expects a woman will be president in the coming years, and it could “possibly” be her. “I am not done,” she said.  The former vice president said she hasn’t decided whether to mount a 2028 presidential campaign. But she dismissed the suggestion that she’d face long odds. “I have lived my entire career a life of service and it’s in my bones.

It's the year of chewy, fruity Halloween treats \n         By Alina Selyukh \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 24, 2025 • 9:09 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's series  Cost of Living: The Price We Pay  is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out  this form  to share your story with NPR. What's the item? Candy How has the price changed since before the pandemic? The price of chewing gum and candy has risen 39%   since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Why has the price gone up?  The cost of chocolate's main ingredient — cocoa — has nearly doubled since the beginning of last year, hitting historic records  again  and  again . That's because harvests of cocoa have come up short for three years straight. The vast majority of the world's cocoa beans grow in West Africa, where farmers have dealt with  extreme weather , changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. What are people doing about it?  All the major chocolate brands have raised their prices, including Nestlé, Lindt, Hershey and Mars, which makes M&Ms, Snickers and Twix. And they're resorting to tricks to make their treats, says David Branch, who tracks the cocoa market at Wells Fargo's Agri-Food Institute. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We're seeing a lot more fillers going in,\" Branch says. \"They're putting more nuts, less chocolate, keeping the price the same, just reducing the amount of cocoa cost.\" Reese's makes a Halloween-themed peanut butter cup called \"White Ghost\" that's dipped in \"white creme\" instead of chocolate. KitKat's Halloween flavors include cinnamony \"Ghost Toast\" and marshmallowy green-colored \"Witch's Brew,\" both very light on cocoa. And shoppers like Stephanie Espinosa are noticing another tactic. \"The bags for chocolate are definitely smaller now and there's less pieces,\" says Espinosa, whose town of Babcock Ranch, Fla., takes Halloween  very  seriously, with palm trees sprouting glowing eyeballs and ghosts haunting yards and porches. Shrinkflation has taken a gnarly bite out of Espinosa's budget, as she and her husband — in their best pirate chic — expect to \"Ahoy!\" at hundreds of trick-or-treaters. At that scale, chocolate prices hit with much more of a fright. And many shoppers feel that way. Enter: gummy, sour, fruity options. \"The mixed bags are definitely — you can see that there's less of the chocolate pieces in the mixes and more like SweeTARTS or gummies or things like that,\" says Espinosa, who begrudgingly switched to more affordable Tootsie Roll bags for this Halloween. Sales of non-chocolate candy have been growing  much faster  than those of chocolate in recent years. Retail data firm Circana finds that people are still spending more dollars on chocolate treats, but they're buying fewer of them. Overall, Halloween is still a splurgy holiday. The National Retail Federation  forecasts  that spending might surpass the 2023 record with an estimated $114.45 per shopper, as people see the higher prices but choose to let the ghoul times roll. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-warship-maduro-uss-gerald-ford-21cc3ac03f755a657c0541667246c007","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"16:12:26+00:00","title":"Venezuela President Denies U.S. War Fabrication Amid Aircraft Carrier Approach and Citizenship Revocation Bid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a national broadcast, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro claims the U.S. government under President Donald Trump is fabricating a war against Venezuela as the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.

On Saturday, the Venezuelan president also referred to the pressure he has felt from the U.S. government as he started legal proceedings seeking to revoke the citizenship and cancel the passport of opposition politician Leopoldo López. “They promised they would never again get involved in a war and they are fabricating a war that we will avoid,” said Maduro in Friday night’s address.

The vice president said that López’s passport will be revoked “immediately,” and that he is also accused of promoting “economic blockage” and “calling for the mass murder of Venezuelans in complicity with enemy and foreign governments.” The opposition leader reacted on his X account, dismissing the move because “according to the Constitution, no Venezuelan born in Venezuela can have their nationality revoked.” He once more expressed support for a U.S. military deployment and military actions in the country. “Maduro wants to take away my nationality for saying what all Venezuelans think and want: freedom,” López wrote. “After having stolen the 2024 election, we agree to pursue all avenues to end the dictatorship,” the politician added. López spent more than three years in a military prison after participating in anti-government protests in 2014. He was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison on charges of “instigation and conspiracy to commit a crime.” He was later granted house arrest and, after being released by a group of military personnel during a political crisis in Venezuela, left the country in 2020."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-canada-tariffs-3cbc1cbf9ed53a10b442fd55dae1e0a3","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:46:38Z","title":"Trump Hikes Canadian Tariffs by 10% After Ontario Ad Cites Reagan to Criticize U.S. Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 25, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods in response to an anti-tariff television ad aired by Ontario Premier Doug Ford during the World Series.

Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it. Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But  Reagan was wary of tariffs  and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario’s ad spelling out the case against tariffs. Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of  arguments scheduled for next month  that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority. ___ Associated Press writers Rob Gillies in Toronto and Josh Boak in Tokyo contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/east-timor-asean-first-expansion-fbc05e88d80a998a5ea542806437a76c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"01:05:37+00:00","title":"East Timor Joins ASEAN, Cambodia and Thailand Sign Expanded Ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"East Timor has officially joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its 11th member, marking the bloc’s first expansion since the 1990s.

Southeast Asian Nations welcomed East Timor as its newest member Sunday, which its prime minister said was a “dream realized” for the tiny nation. Meanwhile, Cambodia and Thailand signed an agreement expanding a ceasefire on their borders with the hope it will lead to a lasting peace.  “Today, history is made,” Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao told the other leaders as the flag of East Timor, also known as Timor Leste, was added to the other 10 on the stage at a formal ceremony in Kuala Lumpur.  It was ASEAN’s first expansion since the 1990s and was more than a decade in the making.  “For the people of Timor Leste this is not only a dream realized, but a powerful affirmation of our journey — one marked by resilience, determination and hope,” he said.  The ceremony marked the opening of ASEAN’s annual summit, followed by two days of high-level engagements with key partners including China, Japan, India, Australia, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. \n    \n     ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n Thailand and Cambodia sign expanded border ceasefire Shortly after his arrival Sunday,  U.S. President Donald Trump  took part as Cambodia and Thailand signed a formal expansion of the ceasefire that he helped broker this summer to end their border conflict.  “There was a lot of killing. And then we got it stopped, very quickly,” Trump said before Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul signed the agreement.  The terms of the agreement include Thailand releasing 18 Cambodian soldiers held prisoner and for both sides to begin removing heavy weapons from the border area. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n There were few details in the agreement on how it would be carried out, though it said the leaders agreed to establish an observer team made up of ASEAN member states “with the objective of ensuring the full and effective implementation.” Both Cambodian and Thai leaders called the agreement a “joint declaration” on the ceasefire, while Trump dubbed it the “Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “This declaration, if fully implemented, will provide the building blocks for lasting peace,” Anutin said. “But more importantly, it will begin the process of mending our ties.” Hun Manet said that “today marks a historic moment of profound significance for Cambodia and Thailand — a day where we affirm our shared conviction that peace is always possible when nations have the courage and wisdom to pursue it together.”  Trump said he had signed economic agreements with both of those nations, and later also concluded a deal with Malaysia.  Chinese Premier Li Qiang,  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney  and Japan’s newly inaugurated Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi were among more than a dozen other leaders on hand. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Membership in ASEAN could help the one of world’s poorest countries grow East Timor’s accession to ASEAN gives the country, which has just 1.4 million people and a GDP of around $2 billion, better access to an economic community of nations with some 680 million people and a $3.8 trillion economy.  Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim , whose country holds the bloc’s rotating chairmanship, said East Timor’s accession “completes the ASEAN family, the affirming of our shared destiny and deep sense of regional kinship.” He said ASEAN’s goal was to “pursue growth that is both resilient and fair, and to safeguard the welfare of generations to come.” The integration of the region’s youngest nation, and one of its poorest, demonstrates ASEAN’s “inclusivity and adaptability, especially at a time of geopolitical flux,” said Angeline Tan, an analyst with Malaysia’s Institute of Strategic & International Studies:  “As protectionism is on the rise, the expansion of ASEAN demonstrates its commitment to regionalism, openness and equal participation,” she said.  The last country to join ASEAN was Cambodia in 1999. East Timor, wedged between Indonesia and Australia, was a Portuguese colony for over four centuries before declaring independence in 1975. Indonesia invaded nine days later, beginning a brutal 24-year occupation that claimed tens of thousands of lives through conflict, famine and disease. A U.N.-supervised referendum in 1999 paved the way for independence, which was formally restored in 2002. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Today it is led by two independence heroes — Prime Minister Gusmao and  President Jose Ramos-Horta , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.  They are trying to tackle high levels of unemployment, malnutrition and poverty. Some 42% of the country’s population live below the national poverty line. Nearly two-thirds of its citizens are under 30 years old, making youth job creation a high priority. Its major source of government revenues comes from the oil and gas industry, but with resources quickly becoming depleted it is looking to diversify. Initially, the idea of bringing East Timor into ASEAN was met with skepticism by several other members, and even though that was overcome, Joanne Lin, co-coordinator of the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute’s ASEAN Studies Centre in Singapore, said adding the nation is “not without challenges.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Timor-Leste’s administrative and institutional capacity still lags behind most ASEAN members, and full participation will require sustained technical and financial support from the secretariat and member states,” she said. “But its inclusion also brings new energy and perspectives — especially on issues like youth empowerment, democratic governance and small-state diplomacy.”  For East Timor, ASEAN membership gives it access to the bloc’s free trade deals, investment opportunities and a broader regional market. East Timor applied for membership in 2011 and was granted observer status in 2022.  “For us this new beginning brings immense opportunity in trade, investment, education and the digital economy — we are ready to learn, innovate and uphold good government,” Gusmao said.  “This is not the end of a journey, this is a beginning of an inspiring new chapter.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-missile-ballistic-kyiv-4381b48b931d7ed32e44a6d671b97dd5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:12:45+00:00","title":"Russia Targets Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk with Missiles and Drones; Ukraine Appeals for Western Air Defense Systems","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine overnight into Saturday killed at least four people and wounded 20, with significant damage reported in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region.

officials said, and prompted fresh pleas from Ukraine’s president for Western air defense systems.  In the capital, Kyiv, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a ballistic missile attack in the early hours of Saturday, Kyiv’s police said. A fire broke out in a non-residential building in one location, while debris from intercepted missiles fell in an open area at another site, damaging windows in nearby buildings, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service wrote on the message app Telegram.  “Explosions in the capital. The city is under ballistic attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram during the onslaught. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Russia has tested a new nuclear-capable missile, Putin and top general say \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Russia targets Kyiv with drones, killing 3 and wounding 29 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Russia faces a shrinking and aging population and tries restrictive laws to combat it \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             6 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Two killed in Dnipropetrovsk region In the Dnipropetrovsk region, two people were killed and seven wounded, acting regional Gov.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that such attacks intensify Ukraine’s need for Patriot defense systems. “It is precisely because of such attacks that we pay special attention to Patriot systems — to be able to protect our cities from this horror. It is critical that partners who possess relevant capability implement what we have discussed in recent days,” he wrote in English on X.  “America, Europe and the G7 countries can help ensure that such attacks no longer threaten lives,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ukrainians adapt  As plumes of smoke from the attack in Kyiv rose in the background, Ukrainians went about their day shopping in a popular nearby farmer’s market unhindered, having become accustomed to frequent Russian air assaults.  “We didn’t know the attack was right here, but even when we figured it out we still came. Despite the Russians’ strike, there are still a lot of people here who need to eat. I knew that people would come to shop, \" said Halyna Stetsiura, 54.  The fruit and vegetable vendor arrived very early in the morning to prepare her stall, while the attacks were still underway.  Serhi Lihus, 53, a beekeeper, said he was driving to the market when he heard the explosions. “It was still dark, approximately 6:30, everything was on fire,” he said. Still he showed up to the market to sell his honey.  Svitlana Shyshlovska, 40, a customer, said despite the threat of attacks, “you still need to buy food to have something to eat and such markets are not an everyday occasion.”  Push for air defenses Zelenskyy is hoping Ukraine can purchase 25 Patriots from the U.S. to fortify its air defenses, particularly in cities.  Zelenskyy on Friday urged the United States to  expand its sanctions on Russian oil  from two companies to the whole sector, and appealed for long-range missiles to hit back at Russia. Zelenskyy was in London for talks with two dozen European leaders who have  pledged military help  to shield his country from future Russian aggression if a ceasefire stops the  more than three-year war . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The meeting hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed to step up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding momentum to recent measures that have included  a new round of sanctions  from the United States and European countries on Russia’s vital oil and gas export earnings. The talks also addressed ways of helping protect Ukraine’s power grid from Russia’s  almost daily drone and missile attacks  as winter approaches, enhancing Ukrainian air defenses, and supplying Kyiv with longer-range missiles that can strike deep inside Russia. Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to send Tomahawk missiles, an idea U.S. President Donald Trump has considered. Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s envoy for investment and economic cooperation, said Friday he believes Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine were “quite close to a diplomatic solution” to end the three-year war.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Speaking to CNN after arriving in Washington for talks with U.S. officials, Dmitriev said a planned summit in Budapest between Trump and Putin had not been canceled but would likely occur later.  Trump said Tuesday his  plan for a swift meeting  with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.”  Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Malaysia on Saturday, the U.S. president said he would only reschedule the meeting if he was certain of progress.  “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal.

celebrated a traditional Latin Mass on Saturday in St. Peter’s Basilica with the explicit permission of Pope Leo XIV, thrilling traditionalist Catholics who had felt abandoned after Pope Francis greatly restricted the ancient liturgy. A few thousand pilgrims, many of them young families with multiple children and the women covering their heads with lace veils, packed the altar area of the basilica to standing room-only capacity.  Cardinal Raymond Burke, the conservative American figurehead, presided over the 2 1/2-hour liturgy, which was rich in hymn, incense and priests bowing to the altar, their backs to the faithful in the pews.  For many traditionalists, the moment was a tangible sign that Leo might be more sympathetic to their plight, after they felt rejected by Francis and his 2021 crackdown on the old liturgy.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Francis had taken action after the spread of the ancient liturgy,  especially in the United States , dovetailed with the rise of religiously inspired political conservatism and decline in church attendance at more progressive parishes. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n \n   Two-decade tug-of-war over Latin Mass \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n             \n       \n        \n     \n       April 2005 \n       Pope Benedict XVI is elected \n     \n   \n\n   \n       \n       \n             \n     \n       July 2007 \n       Benedict removes restrictions on celebrating old Latin Mass, reviving a rite all but swept away by 1960s Vatican II meetings that modernized the church\n\n \n     \n   \n\n   \n       \n       \n          \n     \n       March 2013 \n       Pope Francis is elected\n \n     \n   \n\n   \n       \n       \n      \n     \n       July 2021 \n       Francis reverses Benedict's reform and reimposes restrictions on celebrating old Latin Mass, saying bishops had complained the 2007 reform had become a source of division \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n       December 2021 \n       Francis doubles down and forbids the celebration of some sacraments according to the ancient rite \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n       February 2023 \n       Francis imposes further limitations, decreeing that the Holy See must sign off on bishops’ decisions to designate additional parish churches for the Latin Mass or to let newly ordained priests celebrate it \n     \n   \n\n   \n       \n       \n     \n     \n       May 2025         \n       Pope Leo XIV is elected \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n       July 2025 \n       Leaked Vatican documents undermine Francis’ justification for restrictions, suggesting that most bishops had expressed general satisfaction with the old Latin Mass \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n       September 2025 \n       In his first interview, Leo says some people have used the liturgy as a political tool but expresses an openness to talk with proponents of the old Latin Mass \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       October 2025 \n       Cardinal Raymond Burke, who criticized Francis’ crackdown, celebrates the old Latin Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica \n     \n   \n \n\n \n  :root {\n    --timeline-line-color: #ccc;\n    --timeline-dot-color: #cc0000;\n    --timeline-mobile-left: 28px;\n  }\n\n  .ap-timeline {\n    position: relative;\n    margin: 2rem auto;\n    padding: 0 1rem;\n    max-width: 900px;\n    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n    color: #1a1a1a;\n  }\n\n  .ap-timeline__title {\n    text-align: center;\n    font-size: 2.5rem;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    margin-bottom: 3rem;\n    position: relative;\n    z-index: 2;\n    background: #fff;\n  }\n\n  /* central line */\n  .ap-timeline__line {\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 50%;\n    top: 6rem;\n    transform: translateX(-50%);\n    width: 2px;\n    height: calc(100% -

Among the reforms was the celebration of the Mass in the vernacular, rather than Latin. In the decades that followed, the old Latin Mass was still available but not widespread. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI relaxed restrictions on celebrating it as part of his overall outreach to traditionalists still attached to the old rite. In one of the most controversial acts of his pontificate,  Francis in 2021 reversed Benedict’s  2007 reform and reinstated restrictions on celebrating the old Mass. Francis said its spread had become a source of division in the church and been exploited by Catholics opposed to Vatican II. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rather than heal the divisions, though, Francis’ crackdown seemed to further drive a wedge. “We are orphans,” said Christian Marquant, a French organizer of Saturday’s pilgrimage. Leo’s election and vows to bring peace and healing Leo, history’s first American pope, was elected with a broad consensus among cardinals and has said his  aim is unity and reconciliation  in the church.

Francis, too, had allowed Latin Masses to be celebrated in the basilica even in the immediate aftermath of his 2021 crackdown, but only by low-ranking priests. In 2023 and 2024, the traditionalists couldn’t find anyone even willing to approach Francis to ask permission, Marquant said.  On Saturday, Burke didn’t mention Francis, his crackdown or Leo in his homily, the key section of which he delivered in Italian, Spanish, French and English. But he referred repeatedly to Benedict and his 2007 reform liberalizing the old liturgy as if it were still very much in force.  Through Benedict’s reform, “the whole church is maturing in an ever deeper understanding and love for the great gift of the sacred liturgy, as it has been handed down to us in an unbroken line from the Apostolic Tradition, from the Apostles and their successors,” Burke said. The Hungarian ambassador to the Holy See, Eduard Habsburg, stood for over an hour with his family among the pilgrims to cross through the basilica’s Holy Door, and then found spots in the standing-room-only section for the Mass. “It’s really nothing like the cliches you hear of traditionalists,” he said as he inched his way into the basilica. “The reality is families with children.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In July,  leaked Vatican documents  undermined Francis’ stated reason for having imposed the restrictions in the first place: Francis had said he was responding to “the wishes expressed” by bishops around the world who had responded to a 2020 Vatican survey, as well as the Vatican doctrine office’s own opinion. But the documents suggested that the majority of Catholic bishops who responded to the survey had expressed general satisfaction with the old Latin Mass and warned that restricting it would “do more harm than good.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Tradition-minded Catholics in the pews hopeful James Rodio, a psychiatrist and father of three, has been attending the traditional Latin Mass with his family for nearly three decades in Cleveland, Ohio.  “I was just struck by the reverence and beauty and symbolism in action and gesture, and of course the content too,” he said in a telephone interview. Even though Rodio had always had access to a traditional Mass in Cleveland, he and other parishioners felt “frustration” at Francis’ crackdown and the restrictions that he imposed. “Behind it all, there was a sadness” and sense that Francis didn’t understand them, he said. “How could any organization have an approach for 16 or 17 centuries and then say it wasn’t valid anymore?” Rodio said he and his fellow parishioners are optimistic about Leo and hope he will allow more parishes to offer the traditional liturgy. In recent weeks, the diocese of Cleveland received a two-year extension to keep allowing the Latin Mass at two diocesan churches. “My guess is Leo may try to do a lot by not doing a lot publicly,” Rodio said. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s  collaboration  with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Fengshen soaks Philippines\n\nAt least five people have been killed and two reported missing as  Tropical Storm Fengshen  sweeps through the Philippines, triggering heavy flooding on the main island of Luzon and a vast landslide on the southern island of Mindanao.\n\nIn Quezon province in the north of the country, five members of one family, including two children, were crushed to death when a tree fell on their bamboo house early on Sunday, according to Philippine disaster agency officials in the town of Pitogo, where the incident took place.\n\nImages posted on social media by officials showed the house destroyed under the weight of a large palm tree, as a rescue team worked to remove the bodies of the family.\n\nAccording to a statement shared on social media, a teenage boy was the lone survivor of the accident in Pitogo, about 153km (95 miles) southeast of the capital Manila.\n\nMore than a dozen flights were ordered cancelled by aviation authorities as Fengshen hovered over

early-warning systems for extreme weather events, leaving millions – especially those in developing nations – vulnerable.\n\nAs it released a new report on Monday, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"07:27:09+00:00","title":"Climate study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new climate study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that even under current global commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the world will still face 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — a significant but reduced increase from the worst-case scenario of 114 days.

It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37+00:00","title":"Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) postponed formal approval of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), a global plan to curb shipping emissions, by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting the carbon tax.

Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.\n\nDisappointed, but still very much Committed!  https://t.co/7P192kAvCx\n\n— Thomas A. Kazakos (@ThomasKazakos)  October 17, 2025\n\nRalph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.\n\n“But we know that we have  international law  on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.\n\nLeading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.\n\nCountries that opposed the measures included  Russia  and Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.\n\nArgentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.\n\nIf it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.\n\nThe framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.\n\nClimate change is already beginning to affect shipping and the safety of seafarers, including by changing  ocean currents  and causing more frequent and  severe storms .\n\nProposals to reduce reliance on dirtier bunker fuel in the shipping industry include using ammonia and methanol, as well as fitting cargo ships with special sails."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36Z","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-asia-trip-malaysia-japan-south-korea-890b52697f86c15e3e196c521d564449","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"00:00:19+00:00","title":"Trump Begins Asia Trip to Negotiate Trade Deals and De-escalate Tensions with China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is beginning a major diplomatic tour of Asia, marking his first trip as president.

As Republicans reject Democratic demands for health care funds, there’s no sign of a break in the impasse, but Trump seems to be continuing on with business as usual, including his foreign trip. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 East Timor joins ASEAN in bloc’s first expansion since the 1990s \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trade tensions appear to have cooled after talks between US and China, setting up a Trump-Xi meeting \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Malaysia warns ASEAN neutrality eroding as global powers compete \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “America is shut down and the President is skipping town,” said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \n    \n     ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n Trump’s first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur.

The president credited Ibrahim with working to resolve the conflict.  “I told the leader of Malaysia, who is a very good man, I think I owe you a trip,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.  Trump on Sunday  may also have a significant meeting  with  Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , who wants to see the U.S. cut a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports. The U.S. administration has justified the tariffs by citing Brazil’s criminal prosecution of  former President Jair Bolsonaro  — a Trump ally. Beyond trade, Lula on Friday also criticized the U.S.  campaign of military strikes  off the South American coast in the name of fighting drug trafficking. He said he planned to raise concerns with Trump at a meeting on Sunday in Malaysia.

The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister,  Sanae Takaichi . Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office. Trump spoke to Takaichi during his flight.  While there, Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In South Korea, Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China’s Xi on the sidelines of the  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  summit.  While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official. The meeting follows  months of volatile moves  in a trade war between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy.  Trump was infuriated earlier this month after Beijing imposed new export controls on rare earths used in technology and threatened to hike retaliatory tariffs to sky-high levels. Trump told reporters on Friday that he might ask Xi about freeing  Jimmy Lai , a pro-democracy newspaper founder, saying “it’ll be on my list.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The only meeting that could possibly eclipse the Xi summit would be an impromptu reunion with  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . Speculation has been rife since South Korea’s Unification Minister Chung Dong-young  told lawmakers this month it was possible  that Trump could again meet with Kim in the  Demilitarized Zone , as he did in 2019. But such a meeting is not on the president’s schedule for this trip, according to the U.S. official.  Trump suggested on Friday that it was hard to reach the North Korean leader. “They have a lot of nuclear weapons, but not a lot of telephone service,” he said.  __ Price reported from Washington.

fled their homes along the Pacific coast as weather experts warned of coastal flooding ahead of the approach of Tropical Storm Fengshen, rescue officials said.\n\nThe eye of the storm was forecast to brush past Catanduanes, an impoverished island of 270,000 people, later on Saturday with gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph).\n\nFengshen will bring heavy rainfall, along with a “minimal to moderate risk” of coastal flooding from 1.2-metre (3.2-foot) waves being pushed ashore, the government weather service said.\n\nMore than 9,000 residents of Catanduanes moved to safer ground, the provincial disaster office said, in an often-repeated drill on the island that has previously been the first major landmass hit by cyclones that form in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Catanduanes provincial government ordered local officials to “activate their respective evacuation plans” for residents of “high-risk areas”, including the coast, low-lying communities and landslide-prone slopes, rescue official Gerry Rubio told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, striking disaster-prone areas where millions of impoverished people live.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the planet warms due to human-driven climate change.\n\nFengshen comes as the country is still reeling from a series of major earthquakes and typhoons that killed dozens of people in recent weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, at least 79 people were killed in a  magnitude 6.9 earthquake  in Cebu province in the central Philippines.\n\nDays later,  another earthquake  struck, this time a magnitude 7.4 off the coast of the southern Philippines, killing at least six people and triggering a second, magnitude 6.9 quake later in the day. Tsunami warnings were issued after each earthquake.\n\nIn late September, several people were killed and thousands were evacuated from villages and schools in the northern Philippines, while offices were closed, as Typhoon Ragasa struck."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/june-lockhart-obituary-lassie-lost-space-d994f1fa075f4a6e204e6cee0f74ed07","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"19:29:47Z","title":"June Lockhart, Iconic 'Lassie' and 'Lost in Space' Star, Dies at 100","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article is an obituary for June Lockhart, a 100-year-old actress renowned for her roles as the nurturing mother figure in the classic television series 'Lassie' and 'Lost in Space'.

whether at home in “Lassie” or up in the stratosphere in “Lost in Space,” has died. She was 100. Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday. “She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,” he said. “It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.” The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star. From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series “Lassie.” From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure “Lost in Space.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos. \n\n Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed. “I must quote Dan Rather,” she said in a 1994 interview. “I can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me. “I love rock ‘n’ roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding — the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don’t go with my image.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Adam Had Four Sons,” “Sergeant York,” “Miss Annie Rooney,” “Forever and a Day” and “Meet Me in St. Louis.” She also made “Son of Lassie,” the 1945 sequel to “Lassie, Come Home,” playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n New life on television When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actor to play the female lead in “Lassie” on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show’s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.) Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star: “I worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap. “Lassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.” After six years in the rural setting of “Lassie,” Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in “Lost in Space.” After their mission is sabotaged by a fellow passenger, the nefarious Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), the party bounces from planet to planet, encountering weird creatures and near-disasters that required viewers to tune in the following week to learn of the escape. Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her “space pie.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n As with “Lassie,” Lockhart enjoyed working on “Lost in Space”: “It was like going to work at Disneyland every day.” “So smart, quick, and funny — she filled her 100 years with curiosity, laughter, and rock ’n’ roll,” Angela Cartwright, who played her daughter on “Lost in Space” posted on Facebook. “I can only imagine she’s feeling right at home as she steps off this planet and into the stars.” Bill Mumy, who played her son in the film, posted on social media: “A one of a kind, talented, nurturing, adventurous, and non compromising Lady. She did it her way. June will always be one of my very favorite moms.” In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of “Petticoat Junction” for the rural comedy’s last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A little bit of everything Lockhart remained active long after “Lost in Space,” appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera “General Hospital” and nighttime soaps, “Knots Landing” and “The Colbys.” Her film credits included “The Remake” and the animated “Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm,” for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl. She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, and toured in the plays “Steel Magnolias,” “Bedroom Farce” and “Once More with Feeling.” “Her true passion was journalism,” Gregory said. “She loved going to the White House briefing rooms.” Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him. Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children’s ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 “A Christmas Carol,” playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents. She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay. Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with “Lassie.” Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: “How wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.” ___ Bob Thomas, a longtime Associated Press journalist who died in 2014, was the principal writer of this obituary."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29+00:00","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a renewed trade conflict between the United States and China, triggered by Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and China’s response with export controls on rare earth minerals.

after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43+00:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season and the first to form in the Caribbean this year, is threatening the Caribbean with life-threatening flooding and landslides due to heavy rainfall.

on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/battle-for-sudans-el-fasher-intensifies-as-rsf-claims-seizing-army-hq","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"10:56:10+00:00","title":"Battle for Sudan’s el-Fasher intensifies as RSF claims seizing army HQ","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have claimed to have captured the Sudanese Armed Forces' (SAF) 6th Division base in El-Fasher, a key military location in North Darfur.

el-Fasher intensifies as RSF claims seizing army HQ\n\nFighting has intensified in Sudan’s besieged city of  el-Fasher  in North Darfur, as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group claimed it had captured a government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) base seen as their last stronghold in the western region.\n\nAn RSF spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday that its forces “managed to liberate the 6th Division in El Fasher, breaking the back of the army and its allies by establishing full control over this strategic military base.” He called the development a significant turning point and “a step on the path to building a new state that all Sudanese will participate in establishing according to their aspirations for freedom, peace, and justice.”\n\nA video posted by the RSF showed its soldiers cheering in front of a sign for the SAF’s Sixth Infantry base. The Reuters news agency was able to verify the location but not the date.\n\n“The takeover of the base…came after days of heavy fighting,” said Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from the capital Khartoum.\n\nThe RSF has  besieged el-Fasher  for the past 18 months as it fights the Sudanese army and allied former rebels and local fighters. It has targeted civilians in frequent drone and artillery attacks, while the siege has caused acute suffering and spread starvation in the city, where 250,000 people remain under fire.\n\nSAF did not immediately give a statement on its current position.\n\nDue to the siege, “the army had difficulty resupplying and reenforcing its soldiers and forces” at the military base, said Morgan, adding that there are layers to the unfolding situation.\n\n“What we understand from military sources is that despite the fact that the RSF has taken over the army division there, the forces themselves were not present inside the base itself,” said Morgan.\n\n“They had withdrawn and rebased themselves around the city, so technically, while the RSF does control the infantry division that used to belong to the Sudanese army there, it does not have full control of the city of el-Fasher itself.”\n\nCapturing el-Fasher would be a significant military and political victory for the RSF and could hasten a physical split of the country by enabling the paramilitary group to consolidate its control over the vast Darfur region, which it has identified as the base for a parallel government established this summer.\n\nActivists have long warned that an RSF takeover of the city would also lead to ethnic attacks, as seen after the capture of the Zamzam camp to the south.\n\nLast week, the RSF said it was facilitating the exit of civilians and surrendered fighters from el-Fasher, but those who have left have reported robberies, sexual assaults, and killings by RSF soldiers on the way.\n\nA United Nations-mandated mission said last month the RSF had committed multiple crimes against humanity in the siege of el-Fasher. SAF has also been accused of atrocities.\n\nFour UN agencies warned this week that thousands of children face imminent death as they remain cut off from food and healthcare.\n\nUN expert Radhouane Nouicer raised concerns this week about intensifying drone attacks by both sides. RSF attacks on power infrastructure on Tuesday knocked out electricity across multiple cities and injured six workers.\n\nFor a  fourth consecutive day  on Friday, RSF drones targeted Khartoum International Airport, which the army had hoped to reopen after retaking the capital in March. The reopening has been postponed as a result.\n\nThe conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 12 million and left 30 million in need of aid, making it the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn recent months, United States President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to intensify efforts to end the war in Sudan. But with his foreign policy focus currently zeroed in on shoring up a fragile Gaza ceasefire and finding a way to reach any type of ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as trade deals, Sudan has not been a priority."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor company Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech, citing serious managerial shortcomings and a threat to European economic security.

Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports the first confirmed detection of mosquitoes in Iceland, specifically the cold-adapted Culiseta annulata species, following record-breaking heat in the summer of 2025.

in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:51:09+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, now a powerful Category 4 storm, is threatening heavy rainfall, flooding, and landslides across Jamaica and southern Haiti, with potential intensification to Category 5.

Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday.

said.\n\n“Our accession is a testament to the spirit of our people, a young democracy, born from our struggle,” he said.\n\n“This is not the end of a journey. This is the beginning of an inspiring new chapter.”\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, whose country currently chairs ASEAN, said that East Timor’s accession “completes the ASEAN family – reaffirming our shared destiny and deep sense of regional kinship”.\n\nThe country’s admission follows a 14-year wait, and is seen as one of the crowning achievements of Malaysia’s ASEAN chairmanship.\n\nEast Timor was ruled for three centuries by Portugal, which abruptly pulled out of its colony in 1975, paving the way for annexation and an at-times bloody occupation by neighbouring Indonesia before East Timor won full independence in 2002.\n\nEast Timorese President Jose Ramos-Horta, who also witnessed the event on Sunday, has long campaigned for ASEAN membership.

As the world’s dominant producer and processor of rare-earth metals, China leverages this control to strengthen its bargaining power in ongoing US-China trade negotiations. The US, which imported $22.8 million worth of rare-earth products from China in 2023 and relies on Chinese supply for critical defence systems like F-35 jets, submarines, and smart munitions, faces significant technological and industrial vulnerability. Analysts view the move as a deliberate signal—part of 'pre-meeting choreography'—to demonstrate China’s ability to disrupt US supply chains, thereby pressuring the US to yield in negotiations.

China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/kurdish-pkk-announces-its-withdrawing-fighters-from-turkiye-to-iraq","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"07:58:12+00:00","title":"Kurdish PKK announces it is withdrawing fighters from Turkiye to Iraq","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has announced the full withdrawal of its fighters from Turkey to northern Iraq, marking a major advancement in a peace process initiated in 2024.

Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has said it is withdrawing all its forces from Turkiye to northern Iraq as part of a peace process with Turkiye, bringing an end to a months-long disarming process following a four-decade armed conflict that killed tens of thousands of people.\n\n“We are implementing the withdrawal of all our forces within Turkiye,” the Kurdish PKK said in a statement read out on Sunday in the Qandil area of northern Iraq, according to a journalist with the AFP news agency present at the ceremony.\n\nIt released a picture showing 25 fighters – among them eight women – who had already travelled there from Turkiye.\n\nA spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) party posted on X that the PKK’s announcement falls within the framework of the “Terrorism-Free Turkiye process.”\n\nÖmer Çelik said the government considered the announcement and its continuation a “strategic and historic step.”\n\nThe PKK, which formally  renounced its 40-year armed struggle  in May, is currently making the transition from armed rebellion to democratic politics in a bid to end one of the region’s longest conflicts, which killed some 50,000 people.\n\nBut it urged Turkiye to take the necessary steps to push forward the process, which began a year ago when Ankara offered an unexpected olive branch to its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan.\n\n“The legal and political steps required by the process … and the laws of freedom and democratic integration necessary to participate in democratic politics must be put in place without delay,” it said.\n\nThe group has said it wants to pursue a democratic struggle to defend the rights of the Kurdish minority in line with a historic call by Ocalan.\n\nIn July, the group  held a symbolic ceremony  in the mountains of northern Iraq, at which it destroyed a first batch of weapons, which was hailed by Turkiye as “an irreversible turning point”.\n\n“Today is a new day; a new page has opened in history. Today, the doors of a great, powerful Turkiye have been flung wide open,” Erdogan said at the time.\n\nThe end of Turkiye’s conflict with the armed group could have wider consequences for the region, including with neighbouring Syria, where the United States is allied with Syrian Kurdish forces, which Ankara deems a PKK offshoot."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/award-winning-palestinian-author-on-israeli-prison-exile-and-homeland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"11:00:29Z","title":"Award-winning Palestinian author on Israeli prison, exile and homeland","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Basim Khandakji, a Palestinian author and former political prisoner, spent 21 years in Israeli prisons, where he endured systematic abuse, solitary confinement, and psychological torture.

There was a kind of quid pro quo: You admit to a particular charge in exchange for getting some younger men out of life sentences, and that is what happened.”\n\nThe United Nations estimates that at least 75 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons since October 2023, and organisations like B’Tselem and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights have revealed systematic abuse.\n\nKhandakji spent months at a time in solitary confinement and was often moved between prisons, spending time in most of Israel’s 19 facilities that hold Palestinians – each as “hellish” as the last, he tells Al Jazeera.\n\n“There are deliberate policies of starvation, abuse, psychological and physical torture, constant humiliation, and intentional medical neglect.”\n\nImages of released Palestinian detainees have prompted outrage around the world. Appearing fit and healthy in photos of them before incarceration, on release, many had been reduced to emaciated, cadaverous shadows of their former selves.\n\nThings changed, Khandakji says, after October 7, 2023 – the date of a Hamas-led attack during which 1,139 people died in Israel and some 250 were taken captive, in response to which Israel launched a two-year genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nKhandakji says prisoners began to die with shocking regularity, with guards using “new horrific methods” – particularly on detainees rounded up by the hundreds from Gaza.\n\n“Inmates saw guards hanging up the bodies of dead prisoners in cells and leaving them there, decaying,” he said.\n\n“Another told me he saw more than 12 dead bodies packed into cells at al-Jalama detention centre.”\n\nKhandakji says the harrowing memories of dead Palestinians and the brutal torture he witnessed and experienced will haunt him for his entire life.\n\n“The main strategy authorities used to break prisoners was starvation,” he said. “There was also ‘cooling’, meaning denial of clothing, blankets, or any heating during the bitter winter.\n\n“There was also constant beatings,” he added. “They use horrifying, savage methods – targeting the head, neck, and spine.”\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to Israeli prison authorities for comment on Khandakji’s accusations, but received no reply.\n\nCommunication with friends and family was banned, he added, and he was prevented from accessing news from the outside world – although he did receive word of his father’s death.\n\n“I was deprived of my father while he was alive, and after his death I was denied the chance to bury him,” he said.\n\nNearly 9,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, many taken in mass roundups, and more than 3,500 are held under “administrative detention”, which Israel created to justify imprisoning people indefinitely without charge or trial.\n\nIn prison, Khandakji says: “Writing gave me … a refuge, a hiding place through which I could escape the brutality of the jail and reclaim my freedom, even if only in my imagination.”\n\nHe had to go on hunger strike repeatedly to get notebooks and pens.\n\nHe wrote as much as he could, keeping his manuscripts hidden from the guards and staying out of their way until he could smuggle his writing out via his lawyer or any other visitor.\n\nIn 2023, his award-winning novel, A Mask, The Colour of the Sky, was published in Lebanon in Arabic and was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction, known as the Arabic Booker.\n\nThe book tells the story of Nur, a Palestinian archaeologist who finds an Israeli ID and takes on the identity of “Ur”, eventually joining an archaeological dig on an illegal Israeli settlement.\n\nIn it, Khandakji reflects on the uncovering of Palestine’s antiquity and the difference between the constrained life of Nur with his Palestinian ID and Ur, whose sky-blue ID allowed him to go anywhere.\n\nHearing of the shortlisting, an enraged ultranationalist Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, demanded harsher conditions for Khandakji, while others on the Israeli extreme right called for his murder.\n\nHis award triumph included a $50,000 prize and funding for an English translation, paving the way for a global readership.\n\nWhen Israel launched its war on Gaza, conditions became worse in the prison, and guards confiscated Khandakji’s writing material and smashed his reading glasses.\n\nHe felt “completely powerless”, he says. “Being deprived of my pens and notebooks felt like being deprived of air.”\n\nNow free, he aims to publish another novel, which he wrote in his head in his final year of captivity. It is based on one of his closest friends, writer Walid Daqqa, who died of cancer after allegedly deliberate medical neglect by prison authorities.\n\nAside from writing, Khandakji’s only solace in jail was the friendships he made “that even death cannot erase”.\n\n“I live with sorrow and pain because I left behind so many friends in prison, still suffering,” he adds.\n\nOne of these friends, with whom he shared a cell, was Fatah politician Marwan Barghouthi, sentenced to five life sentences plus 40 years in 2004.\n\nBarghouthi is often compared to South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, due to his decades behind bars as a political prisoner and the unifying popularity he has among Palestinians.\n\n“Marwan Barghouthi is a great man,” he said. “If he were released, he could become a unifying national figure.”\n\nThe 66-year-old was beaten unconscious last month by Israeli jail authorities, and his son, Arab, told international media his father fears for his life as Israel continues to ignore international calls for his release.\n\nKhandakji was arrested in 2004, at the age of 21, while in his final year of a journalism and political science degree at An-Najah National University in his hometown of Nablus.\n\nRaised in a family of socialists, Khandakji became active in the Palestinian People’s Party as a teenager. He is now an elected member of the party’s political bureau.\n\nBut during the second Intifada in the early 2000s, he decided to join the armed resistance in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).\n\nLooking back, he says: “In the end, violence in all its forms is inhuman.\n\n“As human beings, we should first try to solve our issues through peaceful and civilised means,” Khandakji said. “But when someone tries to erase you – to annihilate you – your struggle becomes one of existence.\n\n“But if time could go back… I might look for other ways,” he adds, of seeking a different path, one that didn’t deprive him of his family for 21 years.\n\nHe was one of 250 high-profile detainees freed by Israel on October 13 as part of the United States-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIsraeli captives held by Hamas were released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, most of whom were “disappeared” by Israel from Gaza, according to the UN.\n\nKhandakji described the night of his release as “terrifying”, adding that his body was shaking as he “knew the moment of freedom had finally come”.\n\nWhen he passed the prison gates and his bus went south instead of towards Nablus, he knew his full freedom would be denied a little longer.\n\n“Being exiled from your homeland is a burning, painful feeling,” he said. “My first joy, first sorrow, and first dreams were all in my city, Nablus.\n\n“Palestinians, unlike others, do not live in their homeland – their homeland lives within them,” he said.\n\nFor now, Khandakji will continue writing and plans to pursue a PhD after achieving a master’s degree in Israeli studies while imprisoned.\n\nHis family is fighting desperately to reunite with him in Egypt, only to be repeatedly thwarted by Israel.\n\n“I still hope that in the coming period, there will be some human justice that allows me to embrace my mother,” he says.\n\n“Not as a freed prisoner – but simply as a child searching for the scent of his childhood in his mother’s arms.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to prevent cervical cancer — the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/26/live-israeli-attacks-across-gaza-threaten-ceasefire-one-palestinian-dead?update=4061211","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:53:46+00:00","title":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza struggling to rebuild destroyed homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza are struggling to rebuild homes destroyed by conflict, while ongoing Israeli attacks pose a serious risk of structural collapse and endanger lives.

killed and dozens wounded in an overnight Russian air attack on Kyiv, according to the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, as  Russia’s war on Ukraine  approaches its four-year mark.\n\nMayor Vitali Klitschko said on Sunday that “several” Russian drones were operating over the city, and warned people to “remain in shelters”.\n\n“According to preliminary information, three people died and 27 were wounded (including 6 children),” Klitschko wrote later on Telegram, adding that all had received medical attention and some had been hospitalised.\n\nHe said drone fragments fell onto a nine-storey residential building in the northeastern Desnyansky district, sparking fires in apartments on several floors.\n\n“The fire has already been extinguished. Work is ongoing to dismantle the structures,” wrote Klitschko.\n\nFragments damaged another nine-floor block in the same district, where five people were rescued, he said, adding that “dismantling of structures is ongoing.”\n\nMore drone fragments fell on a 16-storey residential block in the northern Obolonsky district, damaging an apartment, Klitschko said.\n\n“There are no fires or structural collapses,” he added.\n\nThe full scale of the damage and size of the attack were not immediately known. Kyiv and its surrounding region were under air raid alerts for about 1.5 hours before the air force called them off at about 00:30 GMT.\n\nBoth sides deny targeting civilians in their attacks on each other’s territory. But thousands have been killed in the war that Russia started with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the vast majority of them Ukrainian, among them many civilians.\n\nThe attacks came a day after other  Russian drone and missile strikes killed  four,  two of them in Kyiv, and wounded more than a dozen in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities.\n\nOn Saturday, United States President Donald Trump played down prospects of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying he was “not going to be wasting [his] time”.\n\nThe remarks came as Kremlin negotiator Kirill Dmitriev met with Trump administration officials, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, a Russian source familiar with the talks told the AFP news agency. The discussions were expected to continue on Sunday.\n\nThe Kremlin on Sunday said it was wrong to talk about cancelling a meeting between Putin and Trump, but added that preparation for it was needed, Russian agencies reported.\n\nEarlier this week, the US and the European Union announced  new sweeping sanctions  on Russian energy aimed at crippling Moscow’s war economy.\n\nPutin said he would not bend to pressure from the West. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure,” he said, calling the US sanctions an “unfriendly act”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/26/live-israeli-attacks-across-gaza-threaten-ceasefire-one-palestinian-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:53:46+00:00","title":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza struggling to rebuild destroyed homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza are struggling to rebuild homes destroyed during the conflict, as Israeli attacks continue to threaten their safety, with buildings at risk of collapse.

from the Louvre Museum in Paris, the Paris prosecutor says.\n\nProsecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement on Sunday that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Parisien and magazine Paris Match reported that the arrest at the airport took place about 10pm (20:00 GMT) on Saturday while a second suspect was arrested not long after in the Paris region, according to Le Parisien.\n\nThe newspaper said the man arrested at the airport

It said both suspects were in their 30s, originally from the Seine-Saint-Denis area and known to French police.\n\nThe two men have been taken into police custody on suspicion of organised theft and criminal conspiracy, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nBeccuau did not confirm the number of arrests in the operation, which was carried out by the police antigang brigade.\n\nShe condemned the premature leak of information about the arrests, saying it could hinder the work of investigators who were trying to “recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators”.\n\nThe Louvre Museum in the French capital closed one week ago after a group of intruders stole eight pieces of priceless jewellery on October 19 in a  four-minute heist  in broad daylight that rocked the world’s most visited museum and was followed raptly around the globe.\n\nThe robbers had climbed the extendable ladder of a moving truck and cut into a first-floor gallery, taking advantage of what museum staff said was a blind spot in the security surveillance of the museum’s outside walls.\n\nThey dropped a crown as they fled down the ladder and onto scooters but managed to steal eight other pieces, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave his second wife, Empress Marie Louise.\n\nOfficials said the jewels were worth an estimated $102m but have incalculable cultural value.\n\nAn intensive manhunt for the thieves has been ongoing and has involved dozens of investigators.\n\nBeccuau said public and private security cameras had allowed detectives to track the thieves “in Paris and in surrounding regions” while investigators were also able to find dozens of DNA samples and fingerprints at the scene.\n\nThe brazen theft, which the Louvre’s director called a “terrible failure”, has made headlines across the world and sparked a debate in France about the  security of cultural institutions .\n\nWithin 24 hours of the Louvre heist, a museum in eastern France reported the theft of gold and silver coins after finding a smashed display case.\n\nLast month, thieves broke into Paris’s Natural History Museum and stole gold nuggets worth more than $1.5m. A Chinese woman has been detained and charged in relation to the theft."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/26/live-israeli-attacks-across-gaza-threaten-ceasefire-one-palestinian-dead?update=4061234","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:53:46+00:00","title":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza struggling to rebuild destroyed homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Returning Palestinians in north Gaza are facing a dangerous and complex situation as they attempt to rebuild homes destroyed by Israeli attacks.

I wasn’t like this before. I used to be a person who loved life,” she said.\n\nSmall numbers of patients in critical condition have been evacuated for medical treatment under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO). But the numbers being evacuated – including 41 on Thursday – are just a tiny fraction of the  15,000 patients requiring evacuation, including 3,800 children, the WHO said.\n\nIsrael continues to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed despite the ceasefire stipulating that it would open for the movement of people. The WHO has called for all of Gaza’s border crossings to be opened for both the entry of aid and for medical evacuations, saying the evacuations would take a decade or so if they continue at the current rate.\n\nAbu Sbeaka said she and her fellow cancer patients in Gaza were determined to beat the disease, “provided that they hurry up and open the crossings, so we can travel abroad and get the treatment we need to recover quickly”.\n\nIn Khan Younis, Sarhan is fighting her own battle as she struggles to rebuild her shattered life after nearly five months in Israeli detention.\n\nDuring her time in Israeli custody, she said she endured beatings, electric shocks and threats to kill her children during interrogations.\n\nThe ordeal for Sarhan, who was one of two Palestinian women released in the latest exchange under the ceasefire with Israel, began early one morning in May when Israeli special forces disguised as women stormed into the bedroom she shared with her husband.\n\n“They ransacked the house and kept asking questions like ‘Where are you hiding them? Where are the captives?’” Sarhan told Al Jazeera.\n\nShe said they denied any knowledge about the captives before the Israeli soldiers killed her husband in front of their terrified children.\n\n“Then they started grabbing my children one after the other. They kept smashing the furniture. They handcuffed me and took me with them.”\n\nShe said the Israeli forces took her along with her 13-year-old son, leaving the younger children behind “with their dead father lying on the floor”.\n\nSarhan said she was then subjected to a military interrogation during which she was beaten and shocked as Israeli officers questioned her about her husband’s contacts.\n\nShe was told her son would be released, but she was sent to Ashkelon prison in Israel and held for a month “in a dark solitary cell not fit for humans”.\n\nDuring this time, she was subjected to daily interrogations.\n\n“They even threatened to kill my children, to imprison me for life and told me I would not see my children again,” she said.\n\nSarhan is now focused on rebuilding her life without her husband after her release along with other Palestinian prisoners.\n\nMany of the released Palestinians showed  signs of torture and abuse . Among those whose bodies were returned, some appeared to have been blindfolded and executed by Israeli forces. Rights groups said there have been reports of torture in Israeli prisons for years."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/26/live-israeli-attacks-across-gaza-threaten-ceasefire-one-palestinian-dead?update=4061311","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:53:46+00:00","title":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza struggling to rebuild destroyed homes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Palestinians returning to north Gaza are facing immense challenges as homes destroyed by Israeli attacks remain unstable, with buildings at risk of collapse.

has said the United States government is “fabricating” a war against him as Washington sent the world’s biggest warship towards the South American country.\n\nIt signals  a major escalation  of the US’s military presence in the region amid speculation of an attempt to overthrow the Venezuelan government.\n\nMaduro said in a national broadcast on Friday night that US President Donald Trump’s administration is “fabricating a new eternal war” as the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, which can host up to 90 aeroplanes and attack helicopters,  moves closer  to Venezuela.\n\nTrump has accused him, without providing evidence, of being the leader of the organised crime gang Tren de Aragua.\n\n“They are fabricating an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one,” Maduro added. “Venezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves.”\n\nTren de Aragua, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but for its involvement in contract killings, extortion and people smuggling.\n\nMaduro was widely accused of stealing last year’s election in Venezuela, and countries, including the US, have called for him to go.\n\nTensions are mounting in the region, with Trump saying he has authorised CIA operations in Venezuela and that he is considering ground attacks against alleged drug cartels in the Caribbean country.\n\nSince September 2, US forces have bombed 10 boats, with eight of the attacks occurring in the Caribbean, for their role in allegedly trafficking drugs into the US. At least 43 people have died in the attacks.\n\nUnited Nations officials and scholars of international law have said that the strikes are in  clear violation  of US and international law and amount to extrajudicial executions.\n\nVenezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said Saturday the country is conducting military exercises to protect its coast against any potential “covert operations”.\n\n“We are conducting an exercise that began 72 hours ago, a coastal defence exercise … to protect ourselves not only from large-scale military threats but also to protect ourselves from drug trafficking, terrorist threats and covert operations that aim to destabilise the country internally,” Padrino said.\n\nVenezuelan state television showed images of military personnel deployed in nine coastal states and a member of Maduro’s civilian militia carrying a Russian Igla-S shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile.\n\n“CIA is present not only in Venezuela but everywhere in the world,” Padrino said. “They may deploy countless CIA-affiliated units in covert operations from any part of the nation, but any attempt will fail.”\n\nSince August, Washington has deployed a fleet of eight US Navy ships, 10 F-35 warplanes and a nuclear-powered submarine for anti-drug operations, but Caracas maintains these manoeuvres mask a plan to overthrow the Venezuelan government.\n\nMaduro said on Saturday he had started legal proceedings to revoke the citizenship and cancel the passport of opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, whom he accuses of egging on an invasion.\n\nLopez, a well-known Venezuelan opposition figure who has been exiled in Spain since 2020, has publicly expressed his support for the deployment of US ships in the Caribbean and attacks on suspected drug trafficking vessels.\n\nThe opposition leader reacted on his X account, dismissing the move because “according to the Constitution, no Venezuelan born in Venezuela can have their nationality revoked.” He once more expressed support for a US military deployment and military actions in the country.\n\nLopez spent more than three years in a military prison after participating in antigovernment protests in 2014. He was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison on charges of “instigation and conspiracy to commit a crime”.\n\nHe was later granted house arrest and, after being released by a group of military personnel during a political crisis in Venezuela, left the country in 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, the US has also put Colombia’s leadership in its crosshairs.\n\nThe US Department of the Treasury slapped sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and the South American country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti.\n\nFriday’s decision marked a significant escalation in the ongoing feud between the left-wing Petro and his US counterpart, the right-wing Trump.\n\nIn a statement, the US Treasury accused Petro of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.\n\nThe Treasury cited Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, an initiative designed to bring an end to Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict through negotiations with armed rebels and criminal organisations.\n\nPetro, a prolific social media user, quickly shot back that the Treasury’s decision was the culmination of longstanding Republican threats, including from US Senator Bernie Moreno, a critic of his presidency."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q1w9ypl8jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:21:09.008+00:00","title":"How 48 Ukrainian children were saved from Kharkiv kindergarten hit by Russian drone","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Russian drone strike hit the Honey Academy kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine, killing one adult and injuring nine others, but saving 48 children due to their prior sheltering.

Volobuev's body is angled slightly away from the camera, as if bracing against the deadly air still swirling with falling debris and smoke.\n\nHis face in careful concentration, the Major-General from Ukraine's Civil Protection Service clings tightly to a precious bundle, wrapped for protection in his coat - and out of which two small pink shoes protrude.\n\nIt is a striking image of a dramatic rescue from a nursery school in the eastern city of Kharkiv, following a devastating, direct hit by a Russian drone.\n\nUnsurprisingly it has gone viral, capturing both the Ukrainian and the wider global public's imagination.\n\nWith 48 children trapped in a shelter in the burning building, it was not the only act of bravery that day, not by a long way.\n\nBut few photographs better sum up the growing impact of Russia's full-scale invasion on everyday life, with Ukraine's most vulnerable now bearing the brunt, including children.\n\n\"We got the call that there had been an attack on the kindergarten,\" Oleksandr Volobuev told me. \"And, of course, knowing there would be children there, we set off in a state of some anxiety.\"\n\nLittle did he expect that by the end of that day, as a result of carrying that little girl to safety, he would find himself being hailed as a national hero.\n\nIn a split-second moment caught on camera, the Ukrainian people saw not only the reality of Russia's new strategy - its increasing attacks on civilian infrastructure - but also a stark depiction of their own resilience and defiance.\n\nIt's impossible to know why the Honey Academy, based in a sturdy, two-storey brick building in Kharkiv's Kholodnohirsky district, was hit by a Shahed drone.\n\nThe low, menacing hum of those Iranian-designed weapons, which carry a lethal 50kg payload, is now all too familiar, not only to soldiers on the front line, but to Ukrainians everywhere.\n\nWhile they can be devastatingly accurate, the large volume being fired by Russia - with multiple waves of drones in each attack on cities across the country - means some inevitably malfunction.\n\nRussia has regularly denied targeting residential areas, but maps of the city show no obvious military targets in the immediate vicinity of the kindergarten, and the Ukrainian government certainly spoke of it as deliberate.\n\n\"There is no justification for an attack on a kindergarten, nor can there ever be,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky said shortly after the strike. \"Clearly, Russia is growing more brazen.\"\n\nFedir Uhnenko was also with one of the emergency teams rushing to respond to the strike.\n\nNormally, as a press officer with the Civil Defence Service, he is not so closely involved in frontline work.\n\nBut this time, seeing the disaster unfolding in front of him, he knew he had to act.\n\n\"There'd been a huge explosion and there was horror in their eyes,\" he told me, on finding the children huddled in the building's basement.\n\nLuckily, following the air raid warning that had sounded before the attack, the children had taken cover in the school's shelter there.\n\nBut with the fire still burning, the roof destroyed and the building filling with smoke and dust, they were still in danger.\n\nHis colleagues, as well as members of the public who had come to help, stepped forward one by one to scoop up a child.\n\nLike Oleksandr, his more senior commander, Fedir was pictured carrying a child to safety. In his case it was a young boy, through the rubble and smoke.\n\n\"I was reassuring him all the way that everything was fine, there was nothing to worry about,\" he explained.\n\n\"When we came out of the building, there was a car on fire. Our boys were putting it out. And, you know, I was surprised the kid didn't cry. There was certainly fear in his eyes.\"\n\n\"I said to him, go ahead and hold me as tight as you like. I'm quite big myself and, as you can see in the photo, he grabbed me so tightly.\"\n\nIn the end, he had fulfilled two roles: the rescue work and his day job too. His press officer's helmet-camera rolled throughout, capturing many of the up-close photographs and videos that have since been beamed around the world.\n\nThe children were carried to an emergency reception point in a safe zone, a few hundred metres from the nursery school.\n\nAll were unharmed, but there can be little doubt about the danger they faced.\n\nOne adult working nearby was killed in the strike and nine others were wounded, one with serious burns and another a traumatic amputation of her leg.\n\nFor all the rescuers, Fedir told me, there was the constant awareness not only of the risks of fire, falling masonry and smoke, but of the possibility of another strike.\n\nRussia has been known to hit the same target twice, which Ukrainians see as a deliberate strategy to kill emergency workers.\n\nThe day after the nursery school attack, one of these so called \"double taps\" killed a firefighter and wounded five of his colleagues in a village a short distance from Kharkiv.\n\nUkraine believes Russia has turned to civilian targets in desperation over its inability to make significant gains on the battlefield.\n\nBoth Oleksandr and Fedir say what they saw at the kindergarten has done little to change their view of the enemy.\n\n\"From the beginning I have only one feeling that we must go through all this and win,\" Oleksandr told me.\n\nI ask him what kind of future he envisages for the 48 young lives he helped save.\n\n\"Of course, only good, happy lives,\" he replied. \"But not only our children. I would like all children to live in peace.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78z025dze4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"10:57:16.285+00:00","title":"El-Fasher: Rebel forces say they have seized Sudan army headquarters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have captured the Sudanese army’s 6th Division Headquarters in the besieged city of el-Fasher, marking a decisive military victory and effectively ending the government’s hold on Darfur.

Donald Trump has presided over the signing of a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia and announced several trade deals on his first visit to Asia since re-entering the White House.\n\nTrump cosigned the ceasefire on Sunday with his Malaysian, Thai and Cambodian counterparts on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul,  Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim joined Trump for a ceremony marking the deal, which builds on a ceasefire that halted deadly  border fighting in July.\n\n​​”We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,” Trump said.\n\nAnutin said the agreement created “the building blocks for a lasting peace”, while Hun Manet called it a “historic day”.\n\nAnwar  said the agreement “reminds us that reconciliation is not concession but an act of courage”.\n\nThe agreement follows a truce reached in July when Trump used the threat of higher tariffs against both countries to persuade them to end five days of fighting that killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe first phase of the agreement involves Thailand’s release of 18 Cambodian soldiers and the removal of heavy weapons and landmines from the border region. Malaysian troops are to be deployed to ensure the fighting does not restart.\n\nTerritory along the 800km (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades as a result of a vaguely defined French border treaty dating back to 1907.\n\nThe most recent conflict relates to a segment of territory near the border with Laos and another area that is home to several 1,000-year-old temples dating back to the Angkor Empire.\n\nAfter signing the ceasefire on Sunday, Trump inked separate trade deals with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia as well as agreements on critical minerals with Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nUnder the agreements, all three countries pledged to remove most trade barriers on US exports, particularly US agricultural products.\n\nUS tariffs on the three Southeast Asian countries remained at 19 percent.\n\nTrump is on a six-day visit to Asia that is expected to culminate in his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2019 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea on Thursday.\n\nTrump will depart for Japan on Monday, where he will meet newly sworn-in Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. He will then travel to South Korea on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the photo-op with Trump has come and gone, questions remain about the details of the ceasefire and whether it will hold.\n\nMissing from the fanfare are any details about the border itself, said Sebastian Strangio, a journalist and author of Cambodia: From Pol Pot to Hun Sen and Beyond .\n\n“They were never going to address the fundamental question, which is the disagreement on the demarcation of the border and disputes over specific territories,” Strangio told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This was always going to be a hastily assembled deal to give Trump his political theatre and his ceremony. It was never going to be more than an elaborate version of the ceasefire deal they signed on July 28,” he said.\n\nStrangio said the fact Trump has tied his personal prestige to the ceasefire could encourage the leaders of Cambodia and Thailand to enforce it but tensions remain high on the ground.\n\nSporadic violence has also broken out in the border region since the ceasefire, and a peace process will be complicated by the removal of landmines, he said.\n\nThais cautious\n\nReporting from Sa Kaeo, Thailand, Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng said the agreement signed on Sunday essentially reinforced “agreements that have already been made”.\n\nMalaysian troops were supposed to deploy under the initial agreement signed in July but have not yet arrived, he said.\n\nHe said that while Thais welcomed “any kind of move towards peace”, they were viewing the agreement as “the beginning of the end” to the conflict rather than hailing it as having resolved the dispute in itself.\n\n“The devil is going to be in the details of this agreement,” Cheng said.\n\nHe said the Thai military has been working to clear some disputed border areas at the same time as some villages have been building new bomb shelters in recent weeks.\n\n“So people here are still concerned this could go either way,” he said.\n\nTrump’s economic agreements with Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand include significant economic commitments from the countries.\n\nThailand committed to buying $2.6bn a year in US farm products, $5.4bn a year of US energy products and 80 US aircraft worth $18.8bn, while Cambodia pledged to work with US aerospace company Boeing “in support of Cambodia’s aviation ecosystem development,” according to the White House.\n\nMalaysia pledged to buy up to $3.4bn a year in liquefied natural gas from the US plus $200m a year of “coal and telecommunication products”, as well as 30 aircraft from the US with the option to buy 30 more, and to make capital fund investments in the US totalling $70bn.\n\nMalaysia also said it would refrain from “banning, or imposing quotas on, exports to the United States of critical minerals or rare earth elements” and also ensure “no restrictions are imposed on the sale of rare earth magnets to US companies,” according to the White House.\n\nShiro Armstrong, a professor of economics at Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said the deals undermined “ASEAN unity and the principle of equal treatment”.\n\n“There was so much progress made in Malaysia’s leadership of ASEAN in coordinating a collective response that brought coherence to ASEAN’s multilateral principles, but these deals take the shine off that at the very least and potentially undermine everything that was achieved,” Armstrong told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That means this deal was a very expensive one for a photo op. It’s difficult to understand what Malaysia gets from this and what they were thinking,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dy2kk7vzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"07:18:49.827+00:00","title":"Trump presides over Thai-Cambodia 'peace deal' - but what does it mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a ceremonial agreement between Thailand and Cambodia in Kuala Lumpur, which was presided over by US President Donald Trump.

literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims.\n\nIt was all superlatives.\n\n\"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\"\n\nDescribing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\n\n\"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\"\n\nTrump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker.\n\n\"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months – there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\"\n\nBut what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?\n\nRemember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July.\n\nThat, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump.\n\nLooking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of leap forward.\n\nThe two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.\n\nThey have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres.\n\nThey will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.\n\nThis is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick.\n\nBut the  historic differences over the border remain unresolved  and are at risk of flaring up again.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.\n\n\"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it.\n\n\"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine.\n\nCambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with.\n\nAt the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about.\n\nThailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation.\n\nIt says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement.\n\nNeither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony.\n\nSouth East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China.\n\nIt has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%.\n\nTrump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit.\n\nAfter a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off the Japan, and then to a Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nBut just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2em38pdv0do","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"10:58:53.850+00:00","title":"Louvre heist: Suspects arrested over theft of jewels, prosecutor says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two suspects were arrested in Paris following a brazen daylight heist at the Louvre museum, where thieves used power tools to breach the Gallery of Apollo and steal jewels valued at €88 million.

the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.\n\nThe thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (06:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.\n\nThe

only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.\n\nCCTV around the perimeter was also weak and

Brand told the BBC.\n\nSecurity measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.\n\nThe Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following

minutes into using ChatGPT Atlas, the new internet browser from OpenAI, I ran into quite a big road block.\n\nThis isn't like Google Chrome, which is used by roughly 60% of people. It's all built around a chatbot you're meant to talk to to surf the web.\n\n\"Messages limit reached,\" read one note. \"No available models support the tools in use,\" said another.\n\nAnd then: \"You've hit the free plan limit for GPT-5.\"\n\nOpenAI  says it will make using the internet easier  and more efficient. A step closer to \"a true super-assistant\".\n\nBut assistants, super or not, don't come free - and the company needs to start making a lot more money from its 800 million users.\n\nOpenAI says Atlas offers us an opportunity to \"rethink what it means to use the web\".\n\nIt looks somewhat similar to Chrome or Apple's Safari to begin with, apart from the big difference - a sidebar chatbot.\n\nOn a train booking website, it offered to \"highlight deals\" or compare prices with other places.\n\nI asked it to book me a train, but was told this is only available for paying ChatGPT customers.\n\nLater, I tried something simpler: I asked it to take me to an article I was reading the other day, but couldn't quite remember what website it was on.\n\nThese are early days, but there's potential for big changes in how we use the internet.\n\nWhat's clear is this will be a premium product which will only work to its full capacity if you pay a subscription fee.\n\nGiven we are so used to browsing the internet for free, this would require a lot of people to alter their habits quite dramatically.\n\nOpenAI's founding mission was to reach artificial general intelligence - roughly meaning an AI which can match human intelligence.\n\nSo how does a browser help with that mission?\n\nIt doesn't, really. But it could raise some revenue.\n\nThe firm has convinced venture capitalists and investors to back it with billions of dollars - and at some point, it needs to start showing a return on that investment.\n\nIn other words, it needs to make money.\n\nBut raising money the internet's traditional way - advertising - might be a risk.\n\n\"OpenAI may be tempted to show ads to recoup costs and turn a profit, but it also must deliver a good user experience to stand out in a competitive market,\" said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester.\n\nOpenAI will be hoping its users will find it so good they are willing to start paying - but only about 5% of ChatGPT users pay for a subscription, according to the  Financial Times .\n\nThe other thing Atlas could do is give the firm access to a huge amount of user data.\n\nThese kinds of AI tools are ultimately about scale - the more data you feed them, the thinking goes, the better they will become.\n\nThe web is designed for humans to use, so if Atlas can monitor us - how we book train tickets for example - it can learn how to better navigate these kinds of processes.\n\n\"It remains to be seen how OpenAI will use users' data from Atlas, but for users who prefer anonymity and privacy, the browser may be too great of a risk,\" said Ms Liu.\n\nThen we get to the competition.\n\nGoogle Chrome is so dominant, authorities around the world have started  raising eyebrows  and words like \"monopoly\" are being thrown around.\n\nIt won't be easy to muscle into that market.\n\nGoogle's Gemini AI is a part of the search engine now, while Microsoft has added Copilot into its Edge browser.\n\nBack in the early days of ChatGPT, some dubbed it the \" Google killer \" - a game-changer which would make online search as we know it redundant.\n\nThat's not happened yet. But Erik Goins, founder of app developer Flywheel Studios, thinks it could.\n\nHe said Google built its business on \"being the middleman between users and websites\", whereas ChatGPT is \"eliminating the middleman entirely\".\n\n\"You don't search for 'hotels in Miami' and click through Google results anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"You just ask ChatGPT and it connects you directly.\"\n\nWhether enough people are willing to pay for that little bit of extra convenience remains to be seen - and there's a long way to go before Google is toppled.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nTop of the agenda will be trade – an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.\n\nTrump landed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday. He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.\n\nSo what are the wins Trump and other leaders are hoping for, and what are the pitfalls?\n\nOur correspondents explain what you should know about the week ahead.\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n\nInking new trade deals that provide opportunities to American businesses while keeping the tariff revenue flowing into the US Treasury is sure to be a central focus of Trump's Asia trip.\n\nWhile there are multiple players in the global trade dance, the key to Trump's success or failure is China. And Trump's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec – the first since 2019 – could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.\n\nAs the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable. And while he has not explicitly said so, an escalating economic war with America's largest trading partner would have devastating consequences – for the US, for China and for the rest of the world.\n\nThe steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.\n\nWhen he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalise a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.\n\nBut his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.\n\nFor Trump, as the saying goes, that's the whole ballgame.\n\nBy Laura Bicker, China correspondent\n\nWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets Trump on 30 October in South Korea, he wants to be the tougher negotiator.\n\nThat is why he has been leveraging China's stranglehold on rare earths, the minerals without which you cannot make semiconductors, weapons systems, cars or even smartphones. It's a US weakness, and China is exploiting it – just like it is hurting American farmers, and Trump's rural vote base, by not buying their soybeans.\n\nXi has also learned lessons from Trump 1.0 and this time, Beijing, it appears, is willing to embrace the pain of tariffs. For one, the US, which once took in a fifth of Chinese exports, is no longer such a crucial market.\n\nStill Xi has a balance to strike, between an economic battle with the US, and his struggle with domestic challenges. And Washington knows about Xi's troubles: high youth unemployment, a real estate crisis, mounting local government debt and a population unwilling to spend.\n\nAnalysts believe China may offer to do a deal if Trump agrees to start exporting advanced AI chips or pull back on more military support for Taiwan.\n\nBut getting there won't be easy. One big difference is that it often seems like Trump is willing to roll a dice and gamble – but Xi is playing a much longer game.\n\nSo the question may be: can Trump wait it out?\n\nBy Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent\n\nThe US president appears interested in one thing only during his visit to Malaysia: playing the starring role in a ceremony arranged specially for him, at which Thailand and Cambodia signed some kind of peace accord.\n\nDifferences between the two countries over their border remain unresolved, but, under pressure to come up with something, they have made progress in agreeing to demilitarise the border.\n\nNeither can afford to disappoint President Trump. Back in July, when they were still bombing and shelling each other, his threat to end tariff talks forced them into an immediate ceasefire.\n\nOther Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US.\n\nThey have had a tumultuous year in which their export-dependent economies were badly shaken by his tariff war. Exports from the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.\n\nOnce Trump leaves, the other leaders can settle down to normal business – the quiet, incremental diplomacy which advances the plodding progress of integration among them.\n\nAlso on the agenda is a conflict that doesn't have Trump's attention - the civil war in Myanmar, which has haunted every Asean gathering since it was triggered by a brutal coup in 2021.\n\nBy Suranjana Tewari, Asia business correspondent\n\nAsia's manufacturing powerhouses, which make up much of the world's output, will be looking for respite from Trump's tariffs.\n\nSome have agreed deals, while others are still stuck in talks – but none have signed an agreement.\n\nSo ink on paper, or at least promising talks, would be welcome.\n\nTake China. The meeting between Trump and Xi signals progress, but the two leaders have a lot to unpick, from levies and export controls, to the source of it all: rivalry between the world's two biggest economies as they compete for an edge in AI and advanced tech.\n\nAny ease in those tensions would bring relief to other countries in the region who have been caught in the middle. South East Asia may be the most trapped – it is deeply woven into US supply chains in electronics, for example, yet heavily reliant on Chinese demand.\n\nExports to the US have doubled over the past decade, but tariffs of 10% to 40% would pummel manufacturers in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.\n\nIt could also hurt US chipmakers like Micron Technology, which operates plants in Malaysia. The country exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year, roughly a fifth of total US chip imports.\n\nWealthy economies like Japan and South Korea face a different dilemma.\n\nAlthough close allies of the US, they are in for an unpredictable time – and will want to lock in tariff terms and investments. Automakers in both countries, which see the US as a key market, are already struggling to navigate the chaos.\n\nBy Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent\n\nTrump has described Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, as a woman with great \"strength and wisdom\".\n\nThis week, her ability to forge a stable, working relationship with him will be an early test of her leadership - and of Japan's place in a shifting world order.\n\nIn her first speech in parliament, she pledged to raise Japan's defence budget, signalling her intent to shoulder more of the security burden with Washington.\n\nTrump has spoken of this before and is expected to press Tokyo to contribute more to US troop deployments - Japan hosts the largest number of American forces abroad, about 53,000 personnel.\n\nBoth sides also want to finalise a tariff deal negotiated by her predecessor.\n\nParticularly beneficial to Japan's auto giants - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - it cuts US import duties on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, potentially making them more competitive against Chinese rivals.\n\nBy retaining Ryosei Akazawa as chief tariff negotiator, Takaichi is betting on continuity.\n\nIn return, Japan has pledged to invest $550bn in the US to strengthen supply chains in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nTrump has also said Japan will increase purchases of US farm products, including rice, a move welcomed in Washington but unsettling for Japanese farmers.\n\nTakaichi's ties to the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who shared a close rapport with Trump, could also work in her favour.\n\nAbe famously used rounds of golf at Mar-a-Lago to earn Trump's trust – it's the kind of personal diplomacy Takaichi may seek to emulate.\n\nBy Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondent\n\nFor South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.\n\nBut that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBack in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a \"peacemaker\". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019. Kim said last month that he still remembers Trump \"fondly\".\n\nAnalysts believe Kim is hoping to legitimise his nuclear weapons programme with another summit with the US president. There is no indication that a meeting is in the works.\n\nEither way, Lee has a trade deal to negotiate. Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington. The sticking point is Trump's insistence that Seoul invest $350bn upfront in the US – roughly a fifth of South Korea's economy, such a huge investment could create a financial crisis, Seoul fears.\n\nBut in recent days, Korean officials have voiced hope, speaking of tangible progress. And they will be hoping for a signed deal by the end of Wednesday's summit between Trump and Lee."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98nd0d61d0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:03:39.822+00:00","title":"Willpower doesn’t exist.

Now, they're far less dogmatic.\n\nThe brothers say a healthy range of sleep can be anywhere between six and 10 hours.\n\n\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.\n\nRealising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.\n\nXand says this helped him \"shed all that anxiety\" around optimal sleeping patterns and times.\n\n\"It no longer dominates my life and I think about it a lot less.\"\n\nHe also feels a lot more comfortable taking naps when needed and says he will sometimes \"have a 20 minute sleep if I'm exhausted\".\n\nThe pair both find saying \"no\" difficult and Xand says it can feel \"almost physically painful.\"\n\nThey have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.\n\nChris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful.\n\n\"I know I should do, but somehow I'm not and I know I need to focus on that.\"\n\nThe podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons.\n\nHe has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life.\n\n\"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"\n\nOne of the most practical tips that has stuck with the brothers is how they brush their teeth.\n\nThe small act has become a mindful task and Xand explains he's totally changed the way he brushes.\n\n\"My wife, Dolly, hasn't complained about my bad breath since the episode.\n\n\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\"\n\nWhile Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been.\n\n\"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"\n\nMany people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings.\n\n\"I feel lazy and inadequate most of the time.\n\n\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\"\n\nTheir expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".\n\nWillpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.\n\nFor example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy.\n\nSince the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it.\n\n\"I just get on the exercise bike and have those negative thoughts while I do my workout,\" he says.\n\nAnother simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.\n\nChris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\n\n\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\"\n\nFor all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.\n\nTake sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\"\n\nThat tension - between what we know and what we do - is at the heart of their podcast.\n\nIf there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\n\n\"So much of your health and well-being isn't your fault,\" says Dr Xand.\n\n\"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4g5ndnkyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:22:14.771+00:00","title":"Printing photos: How to keep your memories safe","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing concern over digital photo longevity, using personal stories and expert opinions to argue that individuals should preserve their most treasured memories through physical photo albums.

reached halfway - then it crashed.\n\nThousands of pictures with friends and family, including early dates with his now wife, were lost forever.\n\n\"It was annoying,\" says the 36-year-old, who lives in Massachusetts. He and his wife Weena, 32, now have a six-year-old daughter, Sophia.\n\n\"When you have a kid you're like, it would have been nice to have those photos now - to save them for her.\"\n\nSophia will never be able to see the pictures of her parents when they first met.\n\nFor Stephen, this was a moment of realisation that digital photos don't always stand the test of time. So he decided to start making physical albums for her.\n\nHe's documented her life as a newborn - featuring her hospital tag and ink prints of her tiny feet - as well as one for each year of her childhood so far.\n\nAnd he's currently putting together an album which will show her life as a five-year-old. Earlier this week he ordered 300 photographs to be printed.\n\nThis is nothing new - people have been compiling photo albums and scrapbooks for more than 100 years. But what should you think about if you want to keep your photos safe?\n\nExperts broadly agree you should keep three versions of your most treasured pictures: the original on your phone, one copy online, and one on a hard drive.\n\nSome even suggest going one step further - printing them out.\n\nIn a digital world, preserving information is everyone's problem.\n\nLast week the UK government told businesses they  should have contingency plans on paper in case of cyber-attacks . And just days ago, a problem with Amazon Web Services  disrupted more than 1,000 businesses globally .\n\nChristopher Barnatt, a former computing and future studies lecturer and YouTuber, says this is why we should think about making physical copies of all important documents - for example birth certificates, insurance papers and passports.\n\nPhotos are arguably no different. And there are plenty of tools we can use to protect them.\n\nOne obvious step is to back them up onto an online cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Google Photos. Smartphones often do this automatically.\n\nBut there are issues like space and cost.\n\niCloud has a limit of 5GB - which covers photos as well as iPhone backups and other app data. After that, iCloud charges UK users £0.99 per month for up to 50GB of space. Google Photos offers 15GB - shared with the user's Gmail and Google Drive content - before charging.\n\nWhile these services are very stable, they are not totally risk-free.\n\nEarlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet her iCloud account was hacked and her password changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple  told her there was nothing they could do about it .\n\nYou don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.\n\nIt's probably safer to keep your photos on a cloud service than on social media.\n\n\"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data.\n\nIn 2019, a server migration by MySpace - which was once the most popular social media platform in the world - resulted in the  loss of 12 years' worth of music uploads .\n\nThey were \"all gone\", says Dr Miyake.\n\nThe company apologised for the data loss.\n\nThere can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month  Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app , much to the annoyance of some users.\n\nSnapchat said 5GB of storage would remain free, but after that users would be charged $1.99 (£1.48) per month for up to 100GB of space.\n\nProf Jane Winters, a digital humanities specialist from the University of London, suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities.\n\n\"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested.\"\n\nThis is why downloading photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea.\n\nYou shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters.\n\nMany hard drives work for up to 10 years - with some lasting for 20 - so it's important to move your pictures to new hard drives as the decades pass.\n\nIf you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out?\n\nDespite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations.\n\nDr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items.\n\n\"It's about valuing what's important to you before it's too late,\" says Prof Winters.\n\nIf you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\".\n\nSouth African Thendo Muloiwa has decided to do just that, at the age of 28.\n\nHe loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a young child and wants to do the same with the digital pictures he has snapped using his phone. They show the places he has been, and the friends he has made during his 20s.\n\nSome archivists and futurists see this return to print as a way to counter a \"digital dark age\" - the idea that photos, videos and text might become unreadable as technology changes.\n\nBut Prof Winters thinks those claims are overblown, pointing to major international efforts to preserve more and more digital and online internet.\n\nFor many people, printing photos is more than just about documenting history.\n\nThendo says there is a particular joy people share when looking through a photo album together and chatting.\n\n\"You can't really do that on your phone,\" Thendo says. \"Sure, you can open up your iCloud or whatever and scroll through all your photos, but you're going to find a lot of random pictures.\n\n\"As opposed to a photo album where you would have the perfect picture that you have picked and put in there - that's the difference.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20enql8027o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:24:40.133+00:00","title":"Sudan's war: The fertile Jebel Marra region where food is rotting amid the conflict","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the midst of Sudan’s devastating civil war, the Jebel Marra region in Central Darfur stands out as a rare area of relative peace and agricultural resilience.

place in Sudan where it is almost possible to forget that a devastating civil war is going on.\n\nWrapped in bright colours and wearing plastic sandals, women in the country's Jebel Marra mountains set off each morning on donkeys, children in tow, to tend the fields.\n\nIn a Mediterranean-like climate and using the fertile soil, they grow peanuts, oranges, apples and strawberries - rare crops for a country now facing one of the world's worst hunger crises. Before the conflict, Jebel Marra's organic oranges were particularly prized across the country for their juiciness.\n\nThe mountainous area in this part of the western Darfur region is dotted with green peaks, especially now as it is the rainy season.\n\nThe rest of Sudan teeters on the edge of disaster.\n\nAcross the country, as a result of the two-and-a-half years of fighting that has crippled agriculture, almost 25 million people - half the population - are facing severe food shortages, including more than 600,000 who are experiencing famine, according to the UN.\n\nBut in the lush highlands of Jebel Marra, the problem is not growing food – it is getting the produce out.\n\n\"We almost sell them for free and sometimes get rid of them on the way [to market], because they get rotten,\" says Hafiz Ali, an orange vendor in Golo town, which is in the midst of the mountains in Central Darfur state.\n\nThe insecurity and the poor state of the roads make transportation almost impossible.\n\nJebel Marra is the last remaining territory controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army - Abdulwahid (SLA-AW). This armed group has remained neutral in the current war. It has never signed a peace deal with the authorities in Khartoum going back to 2003 and the conflict over Darfur at that time.\n\nSLA-AW has controlled what locals describe as \"liberated areas\" for more than two decades.\n\nNow, surrounded by war on all sides, the region is increasingly isolated.\n\nTo the west and north, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied Arab militias have blocked major roads. To the south, RSF positions are bombed almost every week by the Sudanese army - these attacks are also claiming civilian lives.\n\nThe RSF also control areas to the east.\n\nThe result is a closed-off environment where farmers and middlemen can no longer reach the national markets in the cities of el-Fasher 130km (82 miles) away, or Tine, on the Chadian border, 275km (170 miles) away.\n\nThere are other alternatives but none have the same national reach and all involve treacherous journeys.\n\nTawila, right on the edge of SLA-AW territory, has become the site of a makeshift market. It is on the road to el-Fasher, which is cut off by an RSF siege, and has become home to tens of thousands who have managed to flee that city.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of moving the produce any further, there is an oversupply in the market and as a result prices here have fallen.\n\nThere are some here who are looking to buy supplies to try and smuggle produce into el-Fasher - an extremely dangerous and life-threatening trade.\n\nGetting goods this far has always been a challenge and food can sometimes rot on the way.\n\n\"To travel about 12km, it takes you a whole day of driving in the mountains and the mud,\" says Yousif, a fruit vendor in Tawila. But now, he says, the insecurity makes things even worse.\n\nIn Central Darfur, a recent truce between leaders from the Fur ethnic group - dominant here - and Arab nomads has allowed limited trade in some areas.\n\nMarkets have reopened in the SLA-AW- controlled town of Nertiti, where Arab women sell sour milk and Fur farmers bring fruit and vegetables. But the arrangement is fragile.\n\n\"The market only opens once a week. Travel is still dangerous,\" says a trader from Nertiti.\n\n\"Armed robberies still happen on the roads, even after the agreement.\"\n\nFruit and crops can now also be sold in the market in RSF-controlled Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur state. But Arab militias allied to the RSF are frequently accused of harassing or attacking civilians in the area, though the groups deny any wrongdoing.\n\nEach Thursday, which is market day, the number of checkpoints between Nertiti and Zalingei increases, sometimes reaching more than two dozen. But as more vehicles are on the road on market days, more people take the opportunity to travel.\n\nThe checkpoints, some manned by RSF fighters and others by Arab militia, are sometimes overseen by just one armed man in plainclothes, who demands a fee. Drivers will then often try to negotiate as passengers watch on silently.\n\nReturning back to the Jebel Marra region, SLA-AW checkpoints guard every road into the mountains, and armed men also demand money.\n\nBags are searched with contraband, even including skin-bleaching creams, widely used elsewhere in Sudan, are confiscated.\n\nOnce inside the SLA-AW controlled area, despite the relative peace, there are clear signs of the conflict elsewhere in the country.\n\nLorries filled with people fleeing the fighting, particularly around el-Fasher, can be seen on a daily basis.\n\nMany of them find shelter in schools, clinics and other public spaces receiving little to no humanitarian assistance - aid agencies struggle to get through all the checkpoints.\n\nIn Golo, the de facto capital of the SLA-AW territory, a woman who had escaped from el-Fasher, described the dire conditions. She is now sheltering in a classroom with 25 other freshly arrived families.\n\n\"We have no income. No jobs to do, I used to work as a nurse and I can farm, but the land here belongs to people who work only for themselves. We don't know what to do,\" the woman said.\n\nAs she spoke, sick, elderly people lay on the ground and children were screaming from hunger.

2025-10-26T08:07:39.721+00:00\n\nTitle: Kamala Harris 'concerned' she did not ask Biden to quit race\n\nFormer US Vice-President Kamala Harris has expressed concern that she did not ask Joe Biden to pull out of the race for the White House.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC for Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: \"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run for re-election.\"\n\nAfter months of speculation about his health and mental acuity, President Biden ended his re-election bid in July 2024 after a disastrous performance in a debate against Donald Trump a few weeks earlier.\n\nHarris, who stepped in as the Democratic nominee but lost to Trump, has revealed in her book about her three-month campaign that she did not discuss with President Biden her concerns over his ability. Nor did the then 81-year-old raise the issue with her.\n\nIn the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\". She wrote that \"perhaps\" she should have raised it with him.\n\nIn this interview she told the BBC that she still ponders whether she should have acted differently and talked to him about it.\n\n\"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run.\" She said \"my concern, especially on reflection is, should I have actually raised it\". She questioned whether it was \"grace or recklessness\" that stopped her speaking up.\n\nHer worry, she added, was not Biden's capacity to do the job of commander in chief but about whether he would meet the demands of a gruelling election campaign to stay in the White House.\n\nWhen pressed on why there is a distinction, she said there was a serious difference between running for the office and conducting the duties of being president. And running against Trump is even more demanding, she said.\n\nShe said she had a \"concern about his [Biden's] ability, with the level of endurance, energy, that it requires, especially running against the now current president\".\n\nThe former vice-president said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.\n\n\"Part of the issue there was that it would – would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?\"\n\nThe issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.\n\nOne book, Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleged that people close to him covered up his physical deterioration from the public.\n\nBiden's aides have pushed back at the allegation, saying there were physical changes as he got older but no evidence of mental incapacity and nothing that affected his ability to do the job.\n\nIn his first interview after leaving the White House, in May of this year, Biden told the BBC it would not have mattered if he had left the race any earlier.\n\nHis former vice-president is in the UK promoting her new book. In a wide-ranging conversation for the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Harris also said it was \"possible\" she could run for the White House again.\n\nShe has already ruled out running for governor in her home state, California, and the former prosecutor told the BBC she was \"not done\" with public service."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09j4xw7jeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"02:29:17.902+00:00","title":"The $500m slugger who is taking Canada to the World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Canadian-born, Dominican-raised first baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays, is at the heart of a historic moment in Canadian baseball: the team's first World Series appearance in 32 years.

His father, baseball Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr, spent the bulk of his career playing for the now-defunct Montreal Expos, but a World Series title always eluded him.\n\nHis son, who was born in Montreal, is now vowing to bring the championship ring home and give it to his father.\n\n\"My personal goal is to win a World Series and give the ring to my dad,\" the younger Guerrero said in an interview with Tom Verducci of Fox Sports and Sports Illustrated.\n\nGuerrero has played a massive role in Toronto's postseason success, and was crowned Most Valuable Player in the division series leading up to the championship.\n\nNow, the Toronto Blue Jays are facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series on Friday, in what promises to be a storybook match-up between the defending champions and the underdogs.\n\nBoth teams are anchored by two of the most exciting talents in modern baseball. For Los Angeles, that's Shohei Ohtani, the Japanese superstar whose record-breaking $700m deal made headlines around the world, and who is hailed for being elite both as a pitcher and a hitter.\n\nFor Toronto, it's Guerrero Jr - affectionately nicknamed Vladdy Jr among fans - who made his own headlines earlier this year in April after signing the astonishing 14-year, multi-million deal with Toronto.\n\nThat deal was newsworthy not only for its size, but also for what it symbolised. Guerrero Jr, whose baseball career was closely-watched since he was a three-year-old warming up with his father and the Expos, effectively committed the rest of his playing life to Canada's sole MLB team.\n\nAt the time, Guerrero Jr said he felt \"fortunate to carry my dad's legacy and represent an entire country\" and vowed to bring the World Series championship back to Canada.\n\nBefore April, that promise felt like a long shot. The Blue Jays finished the 2024 season at the bottom of their division, and this year's start was tinged with uncertainty over whether Toronto had what it takes - financially and culturally - to keep a superstar like Guerrero Jr.\n\n\"Toronto is known for not signing big, free agents because they don't want to play here,\" preferring more lucrative hubs like New York or Los Angeles, said Liz McGuire, a life-long Blue Jays fan who hosts a podcast called Jay Bird Watching.\n\nThe Canadian city had been burned before. In 2017, fan-favourite Jose Bautista was lured away by the promise of bigger money.\n\nIn 2023, Toronto went into a frenzy over a rumour that Ohtani was going to sign with the Blue Jays. Fans obsessively tracked a private jet flying from Orange County to Toronto in hopes of catching a glimpse of his arrival to the city.\n\nBut when the plane's doors opened, it was Canadian businessman and television personality Robert Herjavec who stepped out instead. The next day, Ohtani announced he had signed a 10-year contract with the Dodgers in sunny Los Angeles. Hearts sank across Toronto.\n\nBut the Blue Jays still had Guerrero Jr, who had been playing with them since he was just 16 years old.\n\n\"He was hitting dingers as a kid,\" recalled Ms McGuire, using the slang term for a home run. When she learned the team had signed him to a 14-year contract, she celebrated by spending $2,500 on a game-used bat signed by him.\n\nGuerrero Jr has earned his eye-watering salary not just on the field, but by being \"incredibly likeable\", said Rob Silver, an Expos-turned-Blue Jays fan who lives in Ottawa, and who hosts a baseball podcast called Launch Angle.\n\n\"The fact that he's a big kid who happens to be this unworldly superstar and future Hall of Famer, and he chose us, that's everything.\"\n\nFans are quick to point out Guerrero Jr's sportsmanship and his dedication to Toronto on and off the diamond. During Game 5 against the Seattle Mariners, he rushed to the field to help his teammate, outfielder George Springer, limp to the bench after getting hit in the kneecap with a ball. Springer would go on to score the winning three-run home run in Game 7.\n\nOff the field, Guerrero Jr appears humble. He lives with his grandmother, and he even incorporated her traditional Dominican dishes into his trainer's diet plan. In recent years, the native Spanish speaker has begun giving more interviews in English to connect with Canadian fans.\n\nAnd in what may be the biggest sign of his complete embrace of the city, Guerrero Jr donned an Auston Matthews Toronto Maple Leafs jersey ahead of the Game 7 match-up against Seattle - ignoring any warnings of alleged curses (the hockey team has famously failed to make it to the Stanley Cup year after year).\n\nIt was a cheeky nod to Canada's most popular sport. While baseball - known colloquially  as \"America's pastime\" -  does not hold the same place in Canadians' national identity as ice hockey, the Jays win has become a rallying moment for the whole country.\n\nIn Toronto, hundreds flooded the streets, climbing poles, playing bagpipes and waving Canadian flags as they broke into impromptu renditions of the national anthem. In Calgary, a hockey game was briefly interrupted to announce the Blue Jays' victory. In New Brunswick, a local church put up a sign that read: \"Thank you God for your love and for George Springer!\"\n\nThe Blue Jays are getting support from Americans, too. Cole Greenhouse, a Lieutenant Commander in the US Navy originally from Missouri, said he typically cheers for the St Louis Cardinals. This World Series, however, he is backing Toronto.\n\nHis first baseball hat at age 11 was a Blue Jays one, he recalled. On Tuesday, he wore a similar cap \"so everybody can see\" his support.\n\nNichole Perry, a Chicago Cubs fan who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, said that she, too, is backing the Blue Jays. Ms Perry said she and other baseball fans are fatigued with the Dodgers' seemingly unlimited budget and \"super team,\" and that it is heartwarming to see how much Canada has embraced the sport she loves.\n\nThe win was also felt in Guerrero Jr's hometown of Don Gregorio in the Dominican Republic, with videos circulating online showing fans celebrating the team.\n\nMany acknowledge that the Los Angeles Dodgers are a tough squad to beat. But plenty of fans still believe the Blue Jays could win it all. \"The nature of baseball is unlike any sport,\" noted Mr Silver. \"Truly, any team could win.\"\n\nAfter the win against Seattle on Monday, the cameras caught Guerrero Jr fighting back tears. The internet was soon flooded with that image, paired with photos of him as a young boy standing beside his father in a Montreal Expos uniform – an emotional snapshot of a journey years in the making.\n\n\"This kid is heading to the World Series.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"12:00:31.462+00:00","title":"Kamala Harris tells BBC she may run for president again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a rare UK interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed that she may run for president again in 2028, dismissing polling data that suggest her as an outsider to the Democratic nomination.

her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.\n\nMaking her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.\n\nSpeaking to  Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg , Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.\n\nAs the Democratic party searches for answers about Republican Donald Trump's decisive victory one year ago, much of the blame has been directed at former President Joe Biden for not standing down sooner.\n\nBut there have also been questions raised about whether Harris could have run a better campaign and set out a clearer message on the number one issue, the economy.\n\nIn the BBC interview Harris entertained the prospect of another run at the White House, saying her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure\", see a female president.\n\nAsked if it would be her, she said, \"possibly\", confirming she is considering another run at the top job.\n\nHarris said she had not yet made a decision, but underlined that she still sees herself as having a future in politics.\n\n\"I am not done,\" the former vice-president said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"\n\nResponding to odds that place her as an outsider to win a place on the Democratic ticket - even behind Hollywood actor Dwayne the Rock Johnson - she said she never listened to polls.\n\n\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nHarris also said she believed predictions she made about Donald Trump behaving as a fascist and running an authoritarian government had come true.\n\n\"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that.\"\n\nShe pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.\n\nHis removal from the airwaves, celebrated by Trump, came after the Trump-appointed regulator threatened Kimmel's broadcasters.\n\n\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.\"\n\nHarris also slammed business leaders and institutions in America who have, in her view, too easily bowed to the president's demands.\n\n\"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\"\n\nThe White House was dismissive when asked for a response to Harris's comments about the president.\n\n\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.\n\n\"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"\n\nHarris has just published her account of her rollercoaster campaign, 107 Days, the time that was left to her to run for the presidency after Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his mental acuity.\n\nIn our full interview with the former vice-president, to be broadcast in the UK on Sunday at 09:00 GMT (05:00 EST), I pressed Harris several times on whether she ought to have urged Biden to make way for her sooner.\n\nHow much did she really know about his health? And a question that may haunt her - whether she would be president now, not Donald Trump, if Biden had withdrawn earlier?\n\nThe answer is plainly, unknowable - the great \"if\" that could have changed the fate of America.\n\nAmong the Democratic soul-searching, Harris's candidacy is often disparaged, her weaknesses as a leader pinpointed as the reasons for her defeat, not just the last-minute nature of Biden's decision.\n\nWhen questioned about what went wrong, rather than plunge into deep analysis, her contention is because she started so late, it was almost impossible to win.\n\nBut having sat down with the Californian former prosecutor in the gilded surroundings of a luxury London hotel - rather than the increasingly golden surroundings of the Oval Office as Donald Trump glitzes up the decor - the possibility of power is something she is not willing to leave behind.\n\nPrevious hints of her future presidential ambition seemed coy, non-committal - \"maybe, maybe not\", or \"I'm not focusing on that right now\".\n\nHer candour in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.\n\nThat may be surprising given the thoroughly bruising nature of a defeat she has described as traumatising. She and her team were devastated by the defeat, which came as a surprise to them.\n\n\"My god, my god, what will happen to our country?\" Harris says she repeated when the result came through.\n\nHer attempt to explain it focuses on how narrow the gap in actual votes was between her and Trump.\n\nThe popular vote was, indeed, very tight, with less than 2% in it. However, Harris was trounced by Trump in the all-important electoral college, where each state has a certain number of votes that tally up.\n\nHarris was willing to drop heavy hints about her own future. But there's less willingness from her, or frankly any other senior Democrats, grappling with their party's long-term dilemmas.\n\nHow does a centre-left party with mainstream leaders take on a right-wing populist leader? Is the answer to focus on Trump? Or is it to argue more forcefully for Main Street?\n\nWhen I challenged the former vice-president on why her campaign did not better connect with working people, she said she needed more time to do that, and pointed to a longstanding drift away from her party among that group.\n\nShe regrets she didn't have long enough in 2024 to make her own pitch on bread-and-butter issues like housing, or childcare.\n\nBut if she had longer next time round, it's far from guaranteed her arguments would be more compelling, or more gladly received.\n\nKamala Harris still travels with the trappings of an entourage. Aides anxiously watch the clock as her every minute is planned with military precision. Non-stop travel, choreographed events in different capitals, a tiny number of carefully planned TV interviews.\n\nThis time, Harris is on the move for a book tour, not a presidential race. But maybe, if she has her way, this is the start of another campaign after all.\n\nThe full interview will be broadcast on  Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg  at 0900 on Sunday 26 Oct 2025.\n\nPictures: Jeff Overs/BBC\n\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter  to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert political insight and insider stories every Thursday."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw92x915xlo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:04:41.823+00:00","title":"'Brothers in the forest' - the fight to protect an isolated Amazon tribe","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the ongoing struggle to protect the Mashco Piro, one of the world’s largest uncontacted Indigenous tribes in the Peruvian Amazon.

working in a small clearing in the Peruvian Amazon, when he heard footsteps approaching in the forest.\n\nHe realised he was surrounded, and froze.\n\n\"One was standing, aiming with an arrow,\" he says. \"And somehow he noticed I was here and I started to run.\"\n\nHe had come face to face with the Mashco Piro. For decades, Tomas - who lives in the small village of Nueva Oceania - had been practically a neighbour to these nomadic people, who shun contact with outsiders. However, until very recently, he had rarely seen them.\n\nThe Mashco Piro have chosen to be cut off from the world for more than a century. They hunt with long bows and arrows, relying on the Amazonian rainforest for everything they need.\n\n\"They started circling and whistling, imitating animals, many different types of birds,\" Tomas recalls.\n\n\"I kept saying: 'Nomole' (brother). Then they gathered, they felt closer, so we headed toward the river and ran.\"\n\nA new report by the human rights organisation,  Survival International, says there are at least 196 of what it calls \"uncontacted groups\" left in the world . The Mashco Piro is believed to be the largest. The report says half of these groups could be wiped out in the next decade if governments don't do more to protect them.\n\nIt claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil. Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks.\n\nRecently, Mashco Piro people have been coming to Nueva Oceania more and more, according to locals.\n\nThe village is a fishing community of seven or eight families, sitting high on the banks of the Tauhamanu River in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, 10 hours from the nearest settlement by boat.\n\nThe area is not recognised as a protected reserve for uncontacted groups, and logging companies operate here.\n\nTomas says that, at times, the noise of logging machinery can be heard day and night, and the Mashco Piro people are seeing their forest disturbed and destroyed.\n\nIn Nueva Oceania, people say they are conflicted. They fear the Mashco Piro's arrows but they also have deep respect for their \"brothers\" who live in the forest and want to protect them.\n\n\"Let them live as they live, we can't change their culture. That's why we keep our distance,\" says Tomas.\n\nThe people in Nueva Oceania are worried about the damage to the Mascho Piro's livelihood, the threat of violence and the possibility that loggers might expose the Mashco Piro to diseases they have no immunity to.\n\nWhile we were in the village, the Mashco Piro made their presence felt again. Letitia Rodriguez Lopez, a young mother with a two-year-old daughter, was in the forest picking fruit when she heard them.\n\n\"We heard shouting, cries from people, many of them. As if there were a whole group shouting,\" she told us.\n\nIt was the first time she had encountered the Mashco Piro and she ran. An hour later, her head was still pounding from fear.\n\n\"Because there are loggers and companies cutting down the forest they're running away, maybe out of fear and they end up near us,\" she said. \"We don't know how they might react to us. That's what scares me.\"\n\nIn 2022, two loggers were attacked by the Mashco Piro while fishing. One was hit by an arrow to the gut. He survived, but the other man was found dead days later with nine arrow wounds in his body.\n\nThe Peruvian government has a policy of non-contact with isolated people, making it illegal to initiate interactions with them.\n\nThe policy originated in Brazil after decades of campaigning by indigenous rights groups, who saw that initial contact with isolated people lead to entire groups being wiped out by disease, poverty and malnutrition.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the Nahau people in Peru made initial contact with the world outside, 50% of their population died within a matter of years. In the 1990s, the Muruhanua people faced the same fate.\n\n\"Isolated indigenous peoples are very vulnerable - epidemiologically, any contact could transmit diseases, and even the simplest ones could wipe them out,\" says Issrail Aquisse from the Peruvian indigenous rights group, Femanad. \"Culturally too, any contact or interference can be very harmful to their life and health as a society.\"\n\nFor the neighbours of uncontacted tribes, the reality of no-contact can be tricky.\n\nAs Tomas shows us around the forest clearing where he encountered the Mashco Piro, he stops, whistles through his hands and then waits in silence.\n\n\"If they answer, we turn back,\" he says. All we can hear is the chatter of insects and birds. \"They're not here.\"\n\nTomas feels the government has left the residents of Nueva Oceania to handle a tense situation by themselves.\n\nHe plants food in his garden for the Mashco Piro to take. It is a safety measure he and other villagers have come up with to help their neighbours and protect themselves.\n\n\"I wish I knew the words to say, 'Here have these plantains, it's a gift,'\" he adds. \"'You can take them freely. Don't shoot me.'\"\n\nAlmost 200km south-east on the other side of the dense forest, the situation is very different. There, by the Manu River, the Mashco Piro live in an area that is officially recognised as a forest reserve.\n\nThe Peruvian Ministry of Culture and Fenamad run the \"Nomole\" control post here, staffed by eight agents. It was set up in 2013 when conflict between Mashco Piro and local villages resulted in several killings.\n\nAs the head of the control post, Antonio Trigoso Ydalgo's job is to stop that from happening again.\n\nThe Mashco Piro appear regularly, sometimes several times a week. They are a different group of people from those near Nueva Oceania, and the agents don't believe they know each other.\n\n\"They always come out at the same place. That's where they shout from,\" Antonio says, pointing across the wide Manu River to a small shingly beach on the other side. They ask for plantain, yucca or sugar cane.\n\n\"If we don't answer, they sit there all day waiting,\" Antonio says. The agents try to avoid that, in case tourists or local boats pass by. So they usually comply. The control post has a small garden they grow food in. When it runs out, they ask a local village for supplies.\n\nIf these aren't available, the agents ask the Mashco Piro to come back in a few days' time. It has worked so far, and there has been little conflict recently.\n\nThere are about 40 people who Antonio sees regularly - men, women and children from several different families.\n\nThey name themselves after animals. The chief is called Kamotolo (Honey Bee). The agents say he is a stern man and never smiles.\n\nAnother leader, Tkotko (Vulture) is more of a joker, he laughs a lot and makes fun of the agents. There is a young woman called Yomako (Dragon) who the agents say has a good sense of humour too.\n\nThe Mashco Piro don't seem to have much interest in the outside world but are interested in the personal lives of the agents they meet. They ask about their families and where they live.\n\nWhen one agent was pregnant and went on maternity leave, they brought a rattle made from the throat of a howler monkey for the baby to play with.\n\nThey are interested in the agents' clothes, especially sports clothes in red or green.  \"When we approach, we put on old, torn clothes with missing buttons - so they don't take them,\" Antonio says.\n\n\"Before, they wore their own traditional clothing - very beautiful skirts made with threads from insect fibres that they crafted themselves. But now some of them, when tourist boats pass, receive clothes or boots.\" says Eduardo Pancho Pisarlo, an agent at the control post.\n\nBut any time the team ask about life in the forest, the Mashco Piro shut the conversation down.\n\n\"Once, I asked how they light their fires,\" says Antonio. \"They told me, 'You have wood, you know.' I insisted, and they said, 'You already have all these things - why do you want to know?'\"\n\nIf someone doesn't appear for quite a while, the agents will ask where they are. If the Mashco Piro say, \"Don't ask\", they take it to mean that person has died.\n\nAfter years of contact, the agents still know little about how the Mashco Piro live or why they remain in the forest.\n\nIt is believed they may be descended from indigenous people who fled into the deep jungle in the late 19th Century, escaping rampant exploitation and widespread massacres by so-called \"rubber barons\".\n\nExperts think the Mashco Piro may be closely related to the Yine, an indigenous people from south-eastern Peru. They speak an antiquated dialect of the same language, which the agents, who are also Yine, have been able to learn.\n\nBut the Yine have long been river navigators, farmers and fishermen, while the Mashco Piro seem to have forgotten how to do these things. They may have become nomads and hunter-gatherers to stay safe.\n\n\"What I understand now is that they stay in one area for a while, set up a camp, and the whole family gather,\" says Antonio. \"Once they've hunted everything around that place, they move to another site.\"\n\nIssrail Aquisse from Fenamad says more than 100 people have come to the control post at various times.\n\n\"They ask for bananas and cassava to diversify their diet, but some families disappear for months or years after that,\" he says.\n\n\"They just say: 'I'm going away for a few moons, then I'll come back.' And they say goodbye.\"\n\nThe Mashco Piro in this area are well protected but the government is building a road which will connect it to an area where illegal mining is widespread.\n\nBut it is clear to the agents that the Mashco Piro do not want to join the outside world.\n\n\"From my experience here at the post, they don't want to become 'civilised',\" Antonio says.\n\n\"Maybe the children do, as they grow up and see us wearing clothes, perhaps in 10 or 20 years. But the adults don't. They don't even want us here,\" he says.\n\nIn 2016, a government bill was passed to extend the Mashco Piro's reserve to an area that would include Nueva Oceania. However, this has never been signed into law.\n\n\"We need them to be free like us,\" says Tomas. \"We know they lived very peacefully for years, and now their forests are being finished off - destroyed.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8y529kl8yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"10:31:09.366+00:00","title":"Japanese tourist falls to death at Pantheon in Rome","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 69-year-old Japanese tourist, Morimasa Hibino, died after falling from a seven-meter height at the Pantheon in Rome around 21:50 local time.

killed in Russian strikes on Kyiv, Ukrainian officials say\n\nThree people have been killed and at least 32 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.\n\nTwo high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed a drone heading towards Moscow, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.\n\nThe latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.\n\nDamage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.\n\nThere has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.\n\nHowever, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.\n\nTrump said that  talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\"  as he shelved plans for the two to  meet in Budapest  over the war in Ukraine.\n\nOn his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely.\n\nTrump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.\n\nThe US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.\n\nZelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.\n\nHowever, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\n\n\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\n\n\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzg680j7lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"23:19:28.197+00:00","title":"Charity boss arrest in BBC sex-for-aid investigation 'gives women strength'","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish charity founder, Sadettin Karagoz, has been arrested following a BBC investigation that revealed systematic sexual abuse and exploitation of vulnerable women, including Syrian refugees, in exchange for aid.

investigation 'gives women strength'\n\nA Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.\n\nBBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.\n\nMr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".\n\nOne of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.\n\nLeft to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.\n\n\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.\n\nBut when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\n\n\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing me… I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"\n\nMadina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\n\n\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.\n\nScared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.\n\nMr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people.\n\nHe says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.\n\nOver the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.\n\nIn all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them.\n\nSeven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.\n\nAccording to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.\n\nShe was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.\n\nOn one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".\n\nAnother time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my hand… he forced me to touch his genitals\".\n\nAfraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.\n\nThe third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.\n\nA single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"\n\nThese testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.\n\nIn 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.\n\nSome women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.\n\nBut after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.\n\nBatoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".\n\nShe adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".\n\nBefore he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.\n\nHe denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\n\n\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"\n\nHe also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.\n\nHowever a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".\n\nWe put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".\n\nWe also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\n\n\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"\n\nSadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.\n\nAll the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51y0p6ne2o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"11:27:01.720+00:00","title":"Migrant sex offender released from prison in error arrested","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hadush Kebatu, a migrant convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in error on a Friday, shortly after being due for deportation under UK Borders Act 2007.

HMP Chelmsford.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of being unlawfully at large.\n\nThe Met Police said Kebatu \"will be returned to the custody of the Prison Service\", though Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he would immediately be deported.\n\nKebatu, who was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping while living in an asylum hotel, was due to be deported when he was mistakenly set free by prison staff.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said Kebatu would be deported and said an investigation into the release was under way, adding: \"We must make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nOne eyewitness told BBC News he was walking his dog in Finsbury Park when he spotted Kebatu being led away by a number of officers.\n\nHe continued: \"I saw police officers with a man that looked like the one who had been released... It's a baffling situation to have a high-profile case of a man who was just let out and was nearby.\"\n\nThe Met said a member of the public tipped off police that they had spotted a man they believed could be Kebatu at a bus stop near Finsbury Park station at 08:03 on Sunday morning.\n\nOfficers were sent to the area and found him 16 minutes later.\n\nKebatu was seen being led away in handcuffs by police wearing different clothes to the prison-issue grey tracksuit he had last been spotted in on Friday evening.\n\nEssex Police were first made aware that Kebatu had been released in error on Friday at 12:57 on Friday but Kebatu had already boarded a train to east London 16 minutes earlier.\n\nKebatu was also was filmed in Chelmsford city centre speaking to members of the public shortly after he was released, and police confirmed he approached several people seeking assistance.\n\nThe Met Police also established that Kebatu made a number of train journeys across the capital.\n\nOfficers issued CCTV images of Kebatu at a library in the Dalston area on Friday evening. He was still wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag with pictures of avocados on it.\n\nKebatu's arrest in July  sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping , where he had been living since arriving in the UK on a small boat.\n\nIn September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.\n\nThe following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work.\n\nKebatu gave his age as 38 during a court appearance, but a judge said he had been seen information indicating he was 41.\n\nHe denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences last month and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already time in jail awaiting his trial. In total, he spent 108 days in prison.\n\nKebatu was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.\n\nDuring his trial, the court heard it was Kebatu's \"firm wish\" to be deported. Under the  UK Borders Act 2007 , a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.\n\nHM Prison Service has instructed governors in England and Wales to implement additional checks before inmates are released by Monday.\n\nA prison officer has been suspended pending investigation but a senior prison staffer told BBC News the release was \"down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\".\n\nThey continued: \"It's not just one prison office who's to blame.

increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.\n\nOntario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.\n\nCanada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.\n\nThe US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.\n\nTrump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.\n\nThree-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.\n\nUS-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\n\n\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"\n\nTrump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nBut he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nTrump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.\n\nThe advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".\n\nThe video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.\n\nWhile the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.\n\nFord had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.\n\nBoth Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip.\n\nResponding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\n\n\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.\n\nThe Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.\n\nFord and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.\n\nBoth men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\n\n\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.\n\nIn response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.\n\nThey ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/europe/louvre-heist-arrests.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:45:46-04:00","title":"Police Make Arrests in Louvre Robbery, Authorities Say","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Police in France made arrests following a shocking daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where four thieves broke into a second-floor gallery using power tools and a truck-mounted lift, stealing eight valuable royal jewels worth over $100 million in under 10 minutes.

Indian farmer stretched out his hand to a visiting farm scientist.\n\n\"Dr  sahib , we will take up your seed,\" he said.\n\nThe scientist was MS Swaminathan - later hailed by Time magazine as \"the Godfather of the Green Revolution\" and ranked alongside Gandhi and Tagore among India's most influential figures of the 20th Century.\n\nWhen Swaminathan asked what had convinced the farmer to try his experimental high-yield wheat that day, the man replied that anyone who spent his Sundays walking from field to field for his work was driven by principle, not profit - and that was enough to earn his trust.\n\nThe farmer's faith would change India's destiny. As Priyambada Jayakumar's new biography The Man Who Fed India shows, Swaminathan's life reads like the story of a nation's leap from \"ship-to-mouth\" survival to food self-sufficiency - reshaping not just India, but Asia's approach to food security.\n\nYears of colonial policies had left Indian agriculture stagnant, yields low, soils depleted, and millions of farmers landless or in debt. By the mid-1960s, the average Indian survived on just 417g of food a day, reliant on erratic US wheat imports - a daily wait for grain ships became a national trauma.\n\nSo dire was the shortage that the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru urged citizens to substitute wheat with sweet potatoes, while the nation's staple carb, rice, remained critically scarce.\n\nThe 'Green Revolution' turned parched fields into golden harvests, doubling wheat yields in just a few years and transforming a nation on the brink of famine into one of Asia's food powerhouses. It was science in the service of survival, and Swaminathan led the way.\n\nBorn in 1925 in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, Swaminathan grew up in a family of landlord farmers who prized education and service. He was expected to study medicine, but the  1943 Bengal Famine , which killed more than three million people, stirred him.\n\n\"I decided to become a scientist to breed 'smarter' crops which could give us more food... If medicine can save a few lives, agriculture can save millions,\" he told his biographer.\n\nSo he pursued plant genetics, earning his PhD at Cambridge and then working in the Netherlands and at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. In Mexico, he met Norman Borlaug, the American agronomist and Nobel Prize winner, whose high-yielding dwarf wheat variety would become the backbone of the 'Green Revolution'.\n\nIn 1963, Swaminathan persuaded Borlaug to send Mexican wheat strains to India.\n\nThree years later, as part of a nationwide experiment, India imported 18,000 tonnes of these seeds. Swaminathan adapted and multiplied them under Indian conditions, producing golden-hued varieties that yielded two to three times more than local wheat while resisting disease and pests.\n\nThe seed import and rollout was far from smooth, Jayakumar writes.\n\nBureaucrats feared dependence on foreign germplasm, logistics slowed down  shipping and customs, and farmers clung to tall, familiar varieties.\n\nSwaminathan overcame these challenges with data and advocacy - and by personally walking the fields with his family, offering seeds directly to farmers. In Punjab, he even enlisted prisoners to stitch seed packets for rapid distribution during sowing season.\n\nWhile the Mexican short-grain wheat was red, Swaminathan ensured the hybrid varieties were golden to suit leavened Indian breads like naans and rotis. Named Kalyan Sona and Sonalika - \"sona\" means gold in Hindi - these high-yielding grains helped turn the northern states of Punjab and Haryana into breadbaskets.\n\nWith Swaminathan's experiments, India quickly shifted to self-sufficiency. By 1971, yields had doubled, turning famine into surplus in just four years - a miracle that saved a generation.\n\nSwaminathan's guiding philosophy was \"farmer-first\", according to Jayakumar.\n\n\"Do you know the field is also a laboratory? And that farmers are actual scientists? They know far more than even I do,\" he told his biographer.\n\nScientists, he insisted, must listen before prescribing solutions. He spent weekends in villages, asking about soil moisture, seed prices, and pests.\n\nIn Odisha, he worked with tribal women to improve rice varieties. In the dry belts of Tamil Nadu, he promoted salt-tolerant crops. And in Punjab, he told sceptical landowners that science alone wouldn't end hunger and that \"science must walk with compassion\".\n\nSwaminathan was keenly aware of the challenges facing Indian farming. As chair of the National Commission on Farmers, he oversaw  five reports  between 2004 and 2006, culminating in a final report that examined the roots of farmer distress and  rising suicides , calling for a comprehensive national farmers' policy.\n\nEven in his late 90s, he stood with farmers - at 98, he publicly supported those protesting in Punjab and Haryana against  controversial agricultural reforms .\n\nSwaminathan's influence extended far beyond India.\n\nAs the   first Indian Director-General of the IRRI in the Philippines in the 1980s, he spread high-yield rice across Southeast Asia, boosting production in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\nFrom Malaysia to Iran, Egypt to Tanzania, he advised governments, helped rebuild Cambodia's rice gene bank, trained North Korean women farmers, aided African agronomists during the Ethiopian drought, and mentored generations across Asia - his work also shaped China's hybrid-rice programme and sparked Africa's Green Revolution.\n\nIn 1987, he became the first recipient of the World Food Prize, honoured as a \"living legend\" by the UN Secretary-General for his role in ending hunger.\n\nHis later work through the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Chennai focused on biodiversity, coastal restoration and what he called a \"pro-poor, pro-women, pro-nature\" model of development.\n\nThe Green Revolution's success also brought serious costs: intensive farming drained groundwater, degraded soil and contaminated fields with pesticides, while wheat and rice monocultures eroded biodiversity and heightened climate vulnerability, especially in Punjab and Haryana.\n\nSwaminathan acknowledged these risks and, in the 1990s, called for an \"Evergreen Revolution\" - high productivity without ecological harm. He warned that future progress would rely not on fertiliser, but on conserving water, soil, and seeds.\n\nA rare public figure, he paired data with empathy - donating much of his 1971 Ramon Magsaysay Award amount to rural scholarships and later promoting gender equality and digital literacy for farmers long before \"agri-tech\" was a buzzword.\n\nReflecting on his impact, Naveen Patnaik, former chief minister of Odisha, says:  \"His legacy reminds us that freedom from hunger is the greatest freedom of all.\"\n\nIn Swaminathan's life, science and compassion combined to give millions that very freedom. He died in 2023, aged 98, leaving a lasting legacy in sustainable, farmer-focused agriculture."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjd8z8049do","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"21:39:16.872+00:00","title":"Catherine Connolly: How the anti-establishment candidate won the Irish presidency","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Catherine Connolly, an independent left-wing politician and TD for Galway West, has won Ireland’s presidential election in a landslide victory over her main rival Heather Humphreys, becoming the country’s 10th president.

Her impressive athletic attributes were viewed hundreds of thousands of times online.\n\nHer main rival Humphreys failed to generate the same positive attention.\n\nThe biggest points of scrutiny levelled at Connolly throughout the campaign focused on her views on foreign policy and the Israel/Hamas conflict.\n\nConnolly is an outspoken supporter of Palestine and frequently speaks about the \"genocide\" in Gaza and criticises \"atrocities\" committed by Israel.\n\nIreland is viewed internationally as being one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe and Irish government ministers are often criticised as being antisemitic by Israeli politicians.\n\nShe sparked debate when she told BBC News NI during the campaign that Hamas was \"part of the fabric\" of Palestinian people.\n\nConnolly has also been a critic of Nato and Fine Gael have hit out at her during the campaign for not being critical enough of Russia.\n\nThe head of state role in Ireland is mostly a ceremonial role and it is not executive. The president and the government are separate so they have no say in government policies.\n\nCurrent president Michael D Higgins has often privately irked Irish ministers during his 14-year tenure by what has been perceived as criticism of government policy. He has been outspoken on Ireland's housing crisis and is also supportive of Palestine.\n\nConnolly and Higgins have a history. Even though Connolly previously served as an Irish Labour councillor, she left the party after they did not add her as a running mate alongside Higgins on the Galway ticket.\n\nSinn Féin leader and opposition leader Mary Lou McDonald told BBC NI she believed Connolly would make the role her own.\n\n\"Catherine brings her authentic self to this role and I am not convinced that you ever have an Uachtarain [Irish president] that is simply a heat and repeat of a previous Uachtarain,\" she said at Dublin Castle.\n\nEven though she is a Palestinian supporter and previously criticised the US and UK governments' roles in the conflict, Connolly told a TV debate last week she would not refuse to meet figures such as US President Donald Trump.\n\n\"If it's just a meet and greet, then I will meet and greet. If the discussion is genocide, then that's a completely different thing. But I doubt that will be the discussion with the president,\" she told the debate.\n\nConnolly sought out to establish herself as a United Ireland candidate and said she would like to see it during her presidency, which runs for seven years.\n\nShe travelled to Northern Ireland during her campaign and her support of a United Ireland is believed to be one of the reasons she received Sinn Féin backing.\n\nMcDonald said Connolly appreciated \"the preparation\" for a United Ireland \"needs to happen now\" and that she would \"exercise that soft power\".\n\n\"This is an exciting time,\" she added.\n\n\"She's the right woman in the right place at the right time.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, Connolly vowed to return a part of her presidential salary - which comes in at around €350,000 (£305,000).\n\nConnolly said she would give back a \"substantial\" portion of the salary to projects.\n\nSpeaking after her win at Dublin Castle she vowed to be an \"inclusive\" president for all stating the Irish people can \"shape a new Republic\".\n\n\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\n\n\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/business/trump-tariffs-southeast-asia-transshipment.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:25:18-04:00","title":"The ‘Sleeper Issue’ at the Heart of Trump’s Trade War on China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights how President Trump’s proposed rule-of-origin policy—requiring products to contain less than 30% foreign content to qualify for preferential tariffs—is a central, unresolved issue in his trade strategy against China.

have been waiting for President Trump to address a question that cuts to the heart of his disruptive plans for global trade.\n\nHow do you decide the origin of goods in a world where virtually all the things we buy, from computers and phones to sofas and cars, contain parts that come from different countries?\n\nThe answer is central to Mr. Trump’s aim to reduce China’s dominant role as the starting point for many of the world’s manufactured goods.\n\n“It’s a sleeper issue,” said Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think tank. “People are trying to convince themselves that it is just technical, but if you take a step back, it’s all going to rest on this.”\n\nNo other region is more exposed to Mr. Trump’s crackdown than Southeast Asia. Billions of dollars a year in raw materials, machinery and finished goods flow from China through Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries across the region.\n\nAhead of Mr. Trump visit to Asia this week, his trade officials have met with negotiators for other countries to try to reach agreements. But whether any prospective deals will contain details that address how Mr. Trump wants to define the nationality of goods is still up in the air.\n\nThe determination that the Trump administration makes on the so-called rule of origin could blow up laboriously negotiated agreements. That is because if a product is shipped from one country but does not meet the origin criteria, it will be hit with a hefty special tariff, which Mr. Trump has warned will be 40 percent.\n\nThis summer, Mr. Trump, pulling back on his opening salvo of sky-high tariffs in Asia, announced frameworks for most Southeast Asia countries with across-the-board tariffs that settled at 19 or 20 percent.\n\nMr. Trump’s trade legacy in his first term was to force companies to set up factories outside China. Now, he is trying to cut China out of supply chains. China has moved goods through Southeast Asia to circumvent American tariffs and has been the source of a swell of exports to the region, much of those in machinery and raw materials that regional factories depend on.\n\nMany of the components in the things that are made around the world come from China, from the screws and glue that hold metal and wood together to the minerals in smartphone batteries.\n\nYet even in Malaysia, where signing a deal with Mr. Trump would be seen as a positive development, there is some hesitancy about the unilateral way that the United States is going about setting new rules for global trade.\n\nMalaysia’s biggest trading partner is China, but one of its biggest industries, semiconductors, depends heavily on the American market, and its exports are at risk with the possibility of separate sector tariffs.\n\n“All we can do is express our concerns — hopefully, they are listening to the confusion,” said Siobhan Das, chief executive of AmCham Malaysia, which represents American companies in Malaysia. “With this trade agreement, what we’re hoping for is that there is clarity and a guideline for how supply chains need to move.”\n\nTrump administration officials have been vocal about setting one rule-of-origin target for the region. They have focused on 30 percent: Any product containing more than that level of foreign parts or content sent to the United States would face the special transshipment tariff. While discussions are fluid, one thing is clear: For much of Southeast Asia, such a low figure would be difficult to meet.\n\nEven if the administration clarifies a final number, for many companies and governments there are many more questions. What counts as foreign content? Does it include foreign investment in a factory? A foreign-branded machine? Foreign workers? In recent years, many factories from China have moved some of their operations to countries like Vietnam but have created local supply chains and employ local workers.\n\nAnd whose role will it be to police this new content rule?\n\n“You’re talking about creating an entire new policing agency for exports to the U.S.,” said Steve Okun, chief executive of APAC Advisors, a geopolitical consulting firm.\n\nGovernments in Southeast Asia are facing a dilemma. Getting clarity on the rule-of-origin number is crucial before signing broader trade agreements. Many of the products they export may not be able to meet the new definition for a local product.\n\nBut if they don’t sign something more concrete than the initial trade agreements with the United States soon, they face the threat of the original steep tariffs that Mr. Trump threatened in the spring.\n\n“It’s deeply unsettling from an economic point of view, because if tariffs were to snap back to those original levels, that would be devastating,” said Daniel Kritenbrink, a longtime American diplomatic official in Asia and former ambassador to Vietnam now at the Asia Group, a think tank. “From a broader strategic point of view, these are countries that look to the U.S. as a balance or guarantor for strategic stability in the region.”\n\nThe countries will also have to negotiate with Mr. Trump over various sector tariffs under a legal provision in the United States known as Section 232, covering products ranging from semiconductors to machinery, furniture and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAll of this will come as Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, in South Korea at the end of the week to talk about a host of economic and political issues dividing the world’s superpowers.\n\n“If you’re heavily dependent on China, then you are between a rock and a hard place,” said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, an organization that focuses on trade.\n\n“No matter how much leverage you have, you’re still a lot smaller than the U.S. or China,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/business/china-us-trade.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"07:17:42-04:00","title":"Chinese and U.S. Officials Reach Framework of a Trade Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators have reached a preliminary framework for a trade deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur, with key discussions on rare earth metals, tariff extensions, fentanyl-related issues, and port fees. The agreement includes potential deferrals on China’s rare earth export controls and benefits for U.S. farmers, but both sides stressed that the deal is not final and must go through domestic approval processes. China has recently implemented strict export controls on rare earth processing technology and equipment used in semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturing, which the U.S. views as a threat to its strategic interests.

negotiators said on Sunday that they had agreed to a framework of a deal ahead of an expected meeting of the countries’ top leaders this week.\n\n“We are moving forward to the final details of the type of agreement that the leaders can review and decide if they want to conclude together,” Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, said to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital.\n\nChina’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, described the talks between the United States and China as “candid and in-depth discussions” on the trade deal, adding that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus.”\n\nThe negotiators were in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where President Trump began a nearly weeklong trip to Asia. He is expected to meet on Thursday with Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, at a separate economic meeting in South Korea.\n\nThe variety of issues discussed in Kuala Lumpur included bilateral trade, export controls, reciprocal tariff extensions, fentanyl-related tariffs and cooperation on combating fentanyl trafficking, according to the Chinese side.\n\nMr. Greer was less specific. He said that the two sides had also discussed another extension in a series of truces on tariffs they have engaged in this year.\n\nMr. Greer said that the negotiations had included rare earth metals, which are mostly produced in China and which are now subject to stringent export controls imposed this year by Beijing. “We talked about extending the truce, we talked about rare earths, of course, we talked about all kinds of topics,” he said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the United States and China had reached a “very substantial framework.” He said that he expected China would offer “some kind of deferral” on its rare earth export controls, and added that the framework also included benefits for U.S. farmers. China has stopped buying soybeans from the United States this autumn.\n\nThe discussions also included steep port fees that the United States recently imposed on ships that were built in China or are owned by Chinese companies. China has retaliated by putting tariffs on American-built ships — few are left on international routes — and on ships partly or entirely owned by American companies or investors.\n\nBoth sides were careful to suggest that they did not have a final deal.\n\n“China and the United States constructively explored a plan for appropriately dealing with some of the concerns of both sides,” Mr. Li said. He added, “The next step is for each side to fulfill their respective domestic approval procedures.”\n\nMr. Li’s reference to “internal approval procedures” used a Chinese term that could be construed as signaling that administrative steps may be planned. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued extensive export regulations on Oct. 9 that immediately halted any further transfer out of China of the technology needed to process rare earth metals.\n\nRare earth metals are essential to a wide range of advanced manufacturing, including the production of cars, semiconductors, drones, factory robots and offshore wind turbines, as well as missiles, fighter jets, tanks and other military equipment. China produces 90 percent of the world’s refined rare earths and rare earth magnets, and up to 100 percent of some kinds of rare earths that are particularly needed for the most cutting-edge technologies and military applications.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Commerce has severely restricted exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets to countries all over the world since April 4. It ordered other export controls on Oct. 9 that are scheduled to take effect on Nov. 8 and Dec. 1. Those rules would limit any shipments across any country’s borders of products containing Chinese rare earth magnets. The rules would also limit exports of equipment to make electric car batteries, another sector in which China is trying to preserve its global technological leadership.\n\nThe new regulations would also limit exports of considerable equipment, like diamond saws, that are needed in the manufacturing of semiconductors and solar panels. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on goods from China if Beijing goes ahead with the export controls.\n\nMr. Bessent echoed Mr. Greer and Mr. Li in cautiously portraying progress achieved in the Kuala Lumpur talks. “We have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss,” he told reporters after the negotiations on Sunday.\n\nChris Buckley contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/business/trump-trade-deals-asean.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"06:11:24-04:00","title":"Trump Opens Trip With Trade Deals in Southeast Asia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump launched his weeklong Southeast Asia trip with trade agreements from Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia, committing to cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and access to critical minerals.

weeklong trip to Asia on Sunday with agreements that secured commitments from Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia that could be used to support his broader goal to contain China.\n\nThe countries agreed to cooperate with Washington on export controls, sanctions and access to critical minerals, gestures that appear to strengthen Mr. Trump’s position ahead of an expected meeting on Thursday with Xi Jinping, China’s top leader.\n\nThe details were buried in a flurry of documents the White House published as Mr. Trump met world leaders in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWhile the statements did not mention China, to varying degrees they signaled each country’s support for Mr. Trump’s aim to reduce China’s stranglehold on some of the most important materials that go into a wide array of products, such as batteries, smartphones and magnets for fighter jets.\n\nIn addition, the statements included language that the countries would coordinate with Washington on combating unfair trade practices. This could mean that if the United States uses sanctions to penalize a Chinese entity, “These countries are going to have to respect that,” said Steve Okun, head of APAC Advisors, a geopolitical consulting firm.\n\n“It advances the principle that the U.S. says, ‘We need to de-risk from China,’” Mr. Okun said.\n\nThe trade announcements also reaffirmed the 19 percent tariff rate for all three countries that Mr. Trump has already imposed. They included demands for market access and preferential treatment for American companies.\n\nA joint statement with Vietnam, also published on Sunday, largely reiterated an earlier agreement the countries had reached, imposing a 20 percent tariff on Vietnamese goods imported by the United States and potentially making it easier for American companies to export autos there.\n\nThe most detailed of the agreements put out on Sunday was with Malaysia. Mr. Trump called it a “major trade deal,” and it includes a pledge by the Southeast Asian country to invest $70 billion in the United States over the next ten years.\n\nAccording to the White House, Thailand agreed to buy 80 American planes worth $18.8 billion, and Cambodia said it would work with Boeing, the American aerospace giant, to support its aviation sector.\n\nThe commitments on minerals announced on Sunday are nonbinding and will require more negotiations, but they were “a step in the right direction,” said Alexander Feldman, a partner at the Asia Group, putting Mr. Trump “in a better negotiating position.”\n\nMissing from Sunday’s announcements were details about so-called rules of origin that many officials and business leaders throughout Southeast Asia have been waiting for. The Trump administration wants to punish countries that allow Chinese exporters to evade tariffs by passing them through third countries. To do so, Washington must define the nationality of products that are shipped to the United States. One idea would be to require countries to put a ceiling on the amount of foreign materials in a good they ship to the United States.\n\nResolution on rules of origin is central to Mr. Trump’s aim to reduce China’s dominant role as the starting point for many of the world’s manufactured goods.\n\nThe next stop for Mr. Trump this week is Japan, where he is expected on Tuesday to meet with Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s new prime minister. Among the issues they could discuss is how Japan can invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States and increase military spending.\n\nThen it’s on to South Korea for what is expected to be the highlight of the trip: Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Xi. The United States and China are locked in a stare-down over tariffs and access to the critical products each is able to lord over the other — American semiconductors and Chinese rare earth materials.\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators, meeting in Kuala Lumpur over the past few days, had made progress. “We have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss,” he told reporters.\n\nJamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, added: “We think we’re getting to a point where we have something done for the leaders for their consideration.”\n\nChina’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, later on Sunday affirmed that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus” on a variety of issues. “Next we are each going to go through our domestic, internal approval processes,” he said.\n\nZunaira Saieed contributed reporting from Kuala Lumpur.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/nyregion/mamdani-sanders-aoc-rally.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"03:00:17-04:00","title":"As the Left’s Biggest Stars Unite Behind Mamdani, a Bigger Test Awaits","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As democratic socialists consolidate behind Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign in New York City, the article highlights a pivotal moment in U.S. politics: the first potential election of a democratic socialist to a major executive office.

2025-10-26T05:01:04-04:00\n\nWhen President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory's family.\n\nFor Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. The cost of tractors and fertilizers have shot up with his tariffs. Labor has grown scarcer in agribusinesses. Major manufacturers have laid off workers. Even the ubiquitous wind turbines that provide income for some Iowa farmers are in the president’s sights.\n\n“Right now, we’re fighting different economic wars all at once,” said Summer Ory, 37, the wife of Mr. Ory’s grandson, Dan. The couple works in the family’s farm business.  “You can sustain it one at a time, but right now it’s death by a thousand paper cuts.”\n\nMs. Ory said she votes in every election, but she, like Mr. Ory, declined to say who she cast her ballot for last November.\n\nSince siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The company bought the rights to the photo on Monday morning after a bit of brainstorming by Mr. Böcker, Ms. Scharwatz and their employees.\n\n“We have even had feedback from abroad saying, ‘Hey, you Germans do have a sense of humor after all,’” Mr. Böcker said in the Reuters interview.\n\nBöcker’s headquarters in Werne, a town in western Germany, is nearly 400 miles from the Louvre.

France\n\nPublished: 2025-10-26T00:01:08-04:00\n\nWith the glorious Louvre museum plundered by thieves in an eight-minute heist, a former president consigned this month to a prison cell, and a recent government that lasted just 836 minutes, an end-of-era air of rot has taken hold of President Emmanuel Macron’s France.\n\nOn the banks of the Seine, opposite the Académie Française, that august guardian of French civilization, tourists and passers-by rubberneck and gawk at the small balcony from which two burglars cut their way into the Louvre’s gilded Galerie d’Apollon on Sunday and made off with the jewels of two French queens and two empresses.\n\nAs thefts go, it was brazen to the point of mockery. A truck-mounted ladder of the kind widely used in Paris to move furniture, a few glass-breaking machine tools and a heavy dose of audacity were all that was needed to make off in broad daylight with eight crown jewels valued at over $100 million, and leave that increasingly fragile thing, French pride, shaken.\n\nThe Louvre, a royal palace that became a labyrinthine museum spread over a half-mile of the right bank of the Seine, is much more than a repository of art. It is the embodiment of the tumultuous history of France, the physical expression of a nation’s restless quest for greatness, and a place widely regarded as near sacred, visited by almost nine million people last year.\n\nTo violate it, and with such contemptuous ease, has been experienced as a form of ridicule at a time when five governments have succeeded one another in the space of two years.\n\n“The burglary has felt like a profound violence, an expression of national disarray and of the degradation of the state,” Aurélie Filippetti, a former culture minister, said in an interview. “The chronic neglect that produced this, despite many warnings, in the largest and most visited museum in the world, is just not serious.”\n\nStewart Chau, a director of the Verian Group, which polls French sentiment, told the newspaper L’Opinion this past week that the most recent survey indicated that 53 percent of French people felt ashamed of the country, up from 38 percent in January, overtaking anger and despair as predominant emotions. Optimism, in general, is uncommon in France.\n\nThe fact that the Louvre was also the place chosen eight years ago by Mr. Macron to celebrate, with great pomp, his first electoral victory in the vast Napoléon Courtyard has added to a sense of shattered French hopes. The promise of that moment is now a distant memory and the president’s popularity at its lowest ebb ever.\n\nFor a couple of days after the theft, the broken window pane on the Louvre’s facade was covered with what looked like a piece of wood, suggestive of a do-it-yourself domestic repair job to keep out a draft. The sole exterior camera on that wing of the Louvre was pointing the wrong way — west, not east — as the embattled museum director, Laurence des Cars, revealed to angry senators at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAs for Rachida Dati, the conservative culture minister and a close friend of Nicolas Sarkozy, the now-imprisoned former president convicted in a campaign financing scandal, she has resorted to a whirlwind of flailing defiance.\n\nHer story, and she’s sticking to it, has been that “there was no failure of security mechanisms,” as she put it to the National Assembly. She has insisted on this despite a leaked draft report from the country’s supreme audit institution that presented a devastating portrait of underinvestment, inadequate security cameras, and delays in essential modernization of the Louvre.\n\nMs. des Cars, the museum director, duly offered her resignation but, in a further circling of the wagons, Ms. Dati and Mr. Macron rejected it. “There is a dereliction of the state,” Sylvain Tesson, a prominent author, told France Inter radio.\n\nOn social media, some have portrayed the president since Sunday wearing the gold, diamond and emerald crown of the Empress Eugénie, which was dropped by the thieves in their hasty escape.\n\nPerhaps in retrospect, the choice of the Louvre to start his presidency, in a courtyard bearing the name of an emperor, betrayed in Mr. Macron an air of grandiloquent loftiness and a near-regal, top-down approach to government that repelled many French people from the start, and many more over time.\n\nDespite repeated pledges that he would become a humble listener, Mr. Macron has never shaken the “Jupiter” epithet, nor been able to contain his penchant for overlong speeches and elaborate strategic plans lacking essential groundwork.\n\nEarly in his presidency, Mr. Macron described his victory as a kind of “break-in,” a shattering of the system that undid in a moment decades of political dominance by parties of the center right and center left. It was indeed a “form of historical brutality,” as he put it then, that ushered a neophyte to power at the age of 39.\n\nNow, another break-in has underscored his plight. It has been the cherry on the cake of his accumulated problems.\n\nEight years on, “Macronism” has birthed no credible alternative party of the center, leaving the country deadlocked and largely paralyzed between the ascendant extreme right of Marine Le Pen, the far left, and several weakened centrist parties bereft of any clear message.\n\nUnder pressure to quit, which he has vowed never to do, Mr. Macron is term limited, with 18 months left to run in his presidency.\n\nHe has been repeatedly mocked by President Trump as a publicity-seeking hound — a flippant affront to Mr. Macron’s commitment to the European Union and the rule of law. His popularity has plunged to 14 percent, according to a recent poll by Elabe, published in the business daily Les Echos.\n\nGazing up at the scene of the crime at the Louvre, Lauric Czeryba, a student of industrial design, shook his head. “It’s chaos,” he said.\n\nHis girlfriend, Léane Lacroix, concurred. “Nobody can agree on anything, “she said, “so we don’t advance.” They are thinking of moving to Denmark.\n\nThis year, Mr. Macron, in an announcement that was widely viewed as part of his quest for a legacy, announced an almost $600 million “Louvre New Renaissance” project. It will move the Mona Lisa to a new exhibition space with its own ticket, shift the main entrance to the museum’s easternmost facade not far from where the thieves broke in, and devote about $93 million to improved security.\n\n“It would be better to start with the plumbing and other basics,” said Ms. Filippetti, the former culture minister. “You don’t isolate a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa and put it to one side so that people can take selfies and leave after paying a premium.”\n\nShe called the grand plan a “bling-bling commercial operation.”\n\nOf course, Mr. Macron presided last year over an extremely successful Paris Olympics.

In his speech, he grew emotional as he recounted how his aunt stopped taking the subway after the Sept. 11 attacks “because she did not feel safe in her hijab.”\n\nMr. Vance and Republicans pounced on his comments, arguing that his focus should be on the victims who died during the attacks.\n\n“According to Zohran the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks,” Mr. Vance wrote on social media, posting a video of Mr. Mamdani’s comments.\n\nMr. Vance’s attacks follow similar ones regularly hurled by Mr. Trump, who has threatened to arrest Mr. Mamdani and has called him a communist. (He is a democratic socialist.)\n\nMr. Vance also criticized Mr. Mamdani last week for meeting with a well-known imam in Brooklyn. The imam, Siraj Wahhaj, who leads Masjid at-Taqwa in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was an unindicted potential co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center terrorist bombing. (The imam was never charged in the case, and The Times reported that the list Mr. Wahhaj appeared on was criticized by some former terrorism prosecutors as being overly broad.)\n\nMr. Mamdani said in an interview on MSNBC on Saturday that Mr. Vance’s comment about his aunt was inappropriate.\n\n“This is all the Republican Party has to offer,” Mr. Mamdani said. “Cheap jokes about Islamophobia so as to not have to recognize what people are living through, attempts to pit peoples’ humanity against each other.”\n\nMr. Mamdani attended the Sept. 11 memorial last month and has expressed sorrow over the people who died in the attacks. He has also talked about what it was like growing up in New York City after the attacks, when Muslims faced racial profiling, police surveillance and hate crimes.\n\nMr. Mamdani compared Mr. Vance to his closest rival in the race, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, arguing that they practiced the same “politics of division.”\n\nAfter Mr. Mamdani gave his speech on Friday outside a mosque in the Bronx, he posted a nearly seven-minute video on social media sharing a similar message. It was viewed more than nine million times.\n\nHis speech touched many Muslim Americans across the country, with some comparing it to former President Obama’s speech on race in 2008. Mr. Mamdani said it was painful to hear Mr. Cuomo laugh when a radio host said that Mr. Mamdani would “be cheering” if there were another Sept. 11-style terrorist attack on New York City.\n\nMr. Mamdani said that Muslims had long faced bigotry in the shadows.\n\n“I will not change the faith that I’m proud to belong to,” he said. “But there is one thing I will change: I will no longer look for myself in the shadows. I will find myself in the light.”\n\nMehdi Hasan, a Muslim journalist, said that it was wrong for Mr. Vance to mock Mr. Mamdani for talking “publicly and emotionally about their experience of racism,” especially when Mr. Vance’s wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants.\n\nThe tone of the mayor’s race has grown increasingly tense during its final weeks. Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican and ally of Mr. Trump, called Mr. Mamdani a “jihadist” for failing to urge Hamas to give up their weapons on Fox News. He later clarified during a debate that he believed that they should do so.\n\nOn Saturday, Ellie Cohanim, a former U.S. deputy special envoy to combat antisemitism under Mr. Trump, posted a photo on social media of the twin towers burning on Sept. 11 and a man falling from one of the buildings.\n\n“Never Forget,” she said. “Vote Andrew Cuomo and save our city.”\n\nDemocrats criticized her post, calling it “cruel” and an effort to politicize the tragedy.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/middleeast/turkey-postwar-gaza-reconstruction-ceasefire.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"05:01:28-04:00","title":"Turkey Offered to Help in Postwar Gaza.

Postwar Gaza. Israel Isn’t About to Say Yes.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-26T05:01:28-04:00\n\nTurkey has emerged as a key actor in solidifying the initial cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and hopes to leverage its powerful military, its experienced construction firms and its relationship with Hamas to play a role in the territory’s future.\n\nBut Israel is staunchly opposed.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan helped press Hamas to accept the cease-fire, making Turkey a key guarantor. But throughout the war, he has harshly criticized Israel and stood by Hamas, which Turkey does not consider a terrorist organization as Israel and other countries do.\n\nAs the war escalated, Mr. Erdogan cut off diplomatic relations and trade with Israel. He routinely calls the war a genocide and has compared Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to Adolf Hitler.\n\nDuring Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Israel this week, reporters asked Mr. Netanyahu whether he would allow Turkish security personnel to play a role in postwar Gaza. “I have very strong opinions on that,” he responded. “You want to guess what they are?”\n\nMr. Vance has said that the United States would not force anything on Israel “when it comes to foreign troops,” but suggested that Turkey could play a “constructive role.”\n\nThis month, Mr. Erdogan said that Turkey would “meticulously monitor the word-for-word implementation” of the cease-fire deal and participate in on-the-ground enforcement and rebuilding.\n\n“We will support the reconstruction activities with the international community to put Gaza back on its feet,” he said.\n\nTurkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said last week that Turkish officials had helped monitor the initial cease-fire. He added that before Turkey could decide whether to participate in a proposed international stabilization force for Gaza, its structure and rules of engagement had to be defined.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesman for the Turkish Defense Ministry told reporters that the ministry was ready to help “protect the peace with its experience from previous peace missions.” The duties of a stabilization force, he added, could include aid delivery, security patrols, border monitoring and the protection of civilian infrastructure.\n\nIsrael has many reasons to distrust Turkey’s intentions in Gaza, given its longstanding political support for Hamas.\n\nIsraeli officials worry that Turkey wants to help the militant group survive in Gaza, rather than assist in dismantling it.\n\n“If you want to have peace, if you want Hamas to disappear,” then Turkey could not play a role in Gaza, Amichai Chikli, a minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s government, said in an interview.\n\n“Turkey supports Hamas,” he said. “That’s a very simple equation.”\n\nOf course, it was Turkey’s relationship with Hamas that enabled Mr. Erdogan’s government to press its leaders to agree to the cease-fire. “That is how ultimately Turkey came to sit at that table,” said Sinan Ulgen, director of Edam, an Istanbul-based research institution. “It is based on its relationship with Hamas, not on its relationship with Israel.”\n\nIsrael is also wary of Turkish aid efforts in Gaza. In 2010, an independent Turkish aid group organized a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza, which Israel had blockaded since 2007, after Hamas came to power. Israeli commandos raided it and nine activists were killed aboard the Mavi Marmara ship, prompting international condemnation. Israel accused the flotilla activists of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn a visit to Israel this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that an international stabilization force in Gaza would have to be made up of “countries that Israel’s comfortable with.”\n\nGallia Lindenstrauss, an expert on Israeli-Turkish relations at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that having Turkish troops in proximity to Israeli soldiers could be risky: “What would happen if there would be an accidental clash?”\n\nMs. Lindenstrauss said that Israel doubts whether the Turks seek a role “to implement the cease-fire as written or to influence the situation on the ground in ways that they want and also to have more leverage against Israel.”\n\nPolitics, both at home and abroad, underpin Turkey’s motivation to seek a role in postwar Gaza, analysts say.\n\n“There is broad support among the public for Turkey taking a role in the stabilization and eventually the reconstruction of Gaza,” Mr. Ulgen said. “It also allows Erdogan to continue to uphold his image as an influential leader at the international level, which plays well with his domestic constituency.”\n\nAhmet Kasim Han, a professor of international relations at Beykoz University in Istanbul, said Turkey was also seeking a role for its construction companies to help rebuild Gaza, if someone else pays for it.\n\nMr. Erdogan’s government also envisions a political role for Hamas in Gaza’s future, Mr. Han said.\n\n“Turkey wants Hamas to remain relevant and it realizes that the only way for Hamas to remain relevant is for it to give up its arms,” he said, adding that he was skeptical that Hamas would heed Turkey’s call. “Neither Turkey nor anyone else can force Hamas to do that.”\n\nSafak Timur contributed reporting from Istanbul.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"06:00:21-04:00","title":"The Thread Tying Together Everything Trump Does","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques Donald Trump’s foreign and domestic policies, arguing that his approach is rooted in personal power and authoritarianism rather than peace or international cooperation.

town on the shores of the Red Sea, they passed billboards depicting President Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt under the words TOGETHER IN PEACE. What kind of peace were they hashing out and who is it for?\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the common thread weaving together so much of what he does — at home and abroad — is power. Whether he is seeking a cease-fire in Gaza or Ukraine, bombing boats off the coast of Venezuela or deploying troops to American cities, the desired result is his personal aggrandizement and the empowerment of his presidency. When he pursues peace, it is personalized — a deal made with other strongmen rarely addresses underlying causes of conflict. When he makes war, it is also personalized — there is no expectation, for instance, that Congress must authorize his actions.\n\nOf course, exhalation was in order earlier this month, when the remaining Israeli hostages were returned to their families, hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians were released and some aid began to move into Gaza. Mr. Trump deserves credit for applying more pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel than Joe Biden ever did. Yet there was little clarity coming out of the summit in Sharm el Sheikh about who would administer Gaza, how Hamas would disarm, or whether Israel would refrain from resuming its onslaught or annexing the West Bank. It felt more like a victory lap than a beginning.\n\nOver the past two years, at least 20,000 Palestinian children have been killed, the International Criminal Court has charged Mr. Netanyahu with war crimes and a preponderance of experts determined that Israel committed genocide. As the cease-fire took hold, there was no reckoning with that reality. Instead, during a stopover in Jerusalem, Mr. Trump addressed the Knesset and called Mr. Netanyahu “a man of exceptional courage,” suggested that he be pardoned over criminal charges he is facing in Israel and praised the “victory” that Israel won.\n\nIf that is a victory, it comes with a cost. Alongside uncounted human remains, any semblance of a rules-based international order lies buried in Gaza’s mountains of rubble. Yet the new order emerging from this reality seemed just fine to most leaders gathered in Egypt. The host, Mr. el-Sisi, has detained an estimated 60,000 political prisoners and was celebrated by Mr. Trump for his effective crime-fighting. Among European leaders present, Mr. Trump singled out fellow right-wing populists Viktor Orban of Hungary and Giorgia Meloni of Italy for praise even though they had little to do with the cease-fire. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led a transition to authoritarianism in Turkey, was also celebrated, along with Gulf Arab leaders who have invested heavily in the Trump family’s business interests. The Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, was caught on a hot mic asking Mr. Trump how to set up a meeting with his sons Eric and Don Jr., who run those family businesses.\n\nInstead of emphasizing the work that remains to be done, particularly for Palestinians still living under siege with no path to self-determination, the principal White House message coming out of Egypt was Mr. Trump’s personal greatness — including a ceaseless campaign for a Nobel Peace Prize. We should not be naïve about the kind of peace Mr. Trump keeps touting. His is a world in which autocratic leaders make deals over the heads of the people, extrajudicial force is legitimized, conflicts simmer so long as they are kept off screens and corruption intermingles with diplomacy.\n\nFar from resolving conflicts, Mr. Trump is simply embracing the victory of the stronger parties. In Ukraine, he has reportedly pressured its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to cede roughly 20 percent of his country, while insisting upon American rights to Ukrainian minerals. In return, the Ukrainians are unlikely to get credible security guarantees, leaving them dismembered and vulnerable. Meanwhile, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, continues his assault knowing that he can end the Ukraine war when he chooses, on his own terms, without facing consequences for war crimes like his fellow I.C.C.-charged leader Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nThis geopolitics of might-makes-right suits Mr. Trump’s ambitions.\n\nWhile he declares himself the “peace president,” his newly rebranded Department of War is blowing boats out of the water in the Caribbean with no domestic or legal basis. He has claimed that this killing is part of a counternarcotics strategy, although Venezuela is not a leading source of illegal drugs coming into the United States.\n\nThe real objective appears to be regime change. Already, Mr. Trump has labeled Venezuela’s dictatorial leader, Nicolás Maduro, a narco-trafficker, authorized C.I.A. covert operations in the country and deployed considerable military might near its borders. As a major oil producer with a left-wing government and right-wing opposition calling for American intervention, Venezuela makes a ripe target for Mr. Trump — so long as he ignores the sordid and counterproductive history of America’s recent regime change wars or the record of C.I.A.-sponsored coups in Latin America.\n\nMr. Trump’s ambitions will not end in Venezuela. Consider his approach to the Americas: Since returning to office, he has threatened airstrikes in Mexico, demanded the return of the Panama Canal, renamed the “Gulf of America,” mused about annexing Greenland and Canada, sanctioned Brazilian officials who prosecuted the former president Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup and extended a $20 billion bailout to another ideological ally — Javier Milei of Argentina.\n\nWithin the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Trump is beginning to act like Mr. Netanyahu in the Middle East or Mr. Putin within the former Soviet Union — a right-wing leader claiming a sphere of influence where he is free to act as he chooses. And the recent history of both those leaders shows how the blend of fear and nationalism that accompanies action within such a sphere of influence can strengthen a leader’s grip on power as increasing authorities are claimed and political opponents are cast as unpatriotic or even dangerous.\n\nMr. Trump similarly understands that his foreign policy is symbiotic with his domestic agenda. His strongman approach to peace — blending self-aggrandizing diplomacy with militarized shows of force — cannot be separated from his assumption of ever-increasing powers at home.\n\nOver the past several months, events overseas have served as pretexts for power grabs within the United States. The Trump administration has used the war in Gaza as an excuse to crush free speech for pro-Palestinian protesters and compel certain universities to submit to federal dictates. Before the first boat was blown out of the water, the administration was deporting immigrants, citing the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — the justification being that we were being invaded by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, a group few Americans could name before it became omnipresent on Fox News. When Americans protested those deportation policies, Mr. Trump deployed the military to American cities to restore “order.”\n\nIt is this approach to politics that he shares with his preferred interlocutors overseas. The now-delayed choice of Budapest as a potential venue for a summit with Mr. Putin on Ukraine speaks volumes. There, he would be hosted by Mr. Orban, a fellow right-wing nationalist leader who has pursued an authoritarian playbook in Hungary that mirrored elements of Mr. Putin’s own consolidation of power in Russia and foreshadowed many moves Mr. Trump has made over the past decade. Conveniently, Mr. Orban also recently withdrew from the International Criminal Court, which would allow him to host Mr. Putin without questions about arresting the Russian leader for war crimes.\n\nUltimately, this is not peace — it is a world without the rules established after World War II to prevent a return of the lethal mix of authoritarianism and aggression that is once again ascendant. That kind of world can seem orderly for a time. On a particular day, it might even appear more peaceful. But history shows that when might makes right, things go terribly wrong.\n\nBen Rhodes is a contributing Opinion writer.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Catholics gathered in St. Peter’s Basilica on Saturday to celebrate the traditional Latin Mass, a liturgy that was replaced by church reforms in the 1960s and further restricted under Pope Francis.\n\nSaturday’s Mass took place with Pope Leo XIV’s permission, giving hope to traditionalists in many countries that he might loosen those restrictions.\n\n“It’s like eating caviar or eating beans,” said one participant, Luigi Casalini, comparing the traditional Latin Mass with the Mass that has been celebrated worldwide since the reforms undertaken by the Catholic Church in the 1960s.\n\nUnder Francis, the debate over the traditional Latin Mass became a proxy for broader conflicts over what some conservatives saw as Francis’ progressive deviation from church doctrine as well as his watering down of tradition and ritual.\n\nPope Benedict XVI had been more open to the use of the traditional Latin Mass, but in 2021, Francis placed heavy restrictions on its celebration. Beyond permitting Saturday’s Mass, Leo has given no official indication on where he stands on a liturgy that is used by a relatively small percentage of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.\n\nIn a new biography published in Spanish last month, Leo said it was “very unfortunate” that the traditional Latin Mass had become divisive, and that he was open to discussion on the issue, in line with his stated desire for unity and reconciliation in the church.\n\nSaturday’s Mass was celebrated by Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American figurehead of the conservative and traditionalist wing of the church and one of Francis’ fiercest critics over the restrictions on the ancient liturgy.\n\n“To be authorized by the pope to celebrate a Mass in St. Peter’s — it means something,” said Rubén Peretó Rivas, one of the organizers of an annual pilgrimage to Rome by supporters of the traditional Latin Mass. For the last two years, they did not celebrate Mass inside the basilica during the pilgrimage because they did not have Francis’ authorization.\n\nLeo’s permission, Mr. Peretó Rivas said, also sent a message to bishops “around the world” who had restricted the celebration of the traditional ritual, as his bishop in his native Argentina had done.\n\nOn Saturday, with Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s gilded bronze throne towering above them, the priests, wearing ornate, gold-threaded vestments, kept their backs to the faithful while presiding over the incense-perfumed Mass, spoken and sung almost entirely in Latin. People came from five continents, organizers said. So many attended that they spilled into the transept of the basilica.\n\nThe faithful stood, knelt, sang and prayed, following a liturgical choreography handed down over centuries. Many women wore lace veils. During his homily, Cardinal Burke said it was a “source of deep joy” to celebrate the Mass in the basilica.\n\nThe traditional Latin Mass, also known as the Tridentine Mass, was in use until the late 1960s, when the church began to celebrate Mass using living languages. But the Tridentine Mass continued in some places. In 2007, Benedict said it should be more widely accepted and easily celebrated, a decision applauded by conservatives.\n\nIn 2021, Francis cracked down on its use, saying proponents were exploiting it to oppose more recent church reforms and to divide the faithful.\n\nIn the United States, debates over celebration of the traditional Latin Mass have been particularly charged, with small but energetic cohorts of traditionalists pushing back against bishops who have cracked down on the Mass in some dioceses. Adherents include some influential conservative bishops and a noticeable share of young adults who are drawn to stricter forms of observance.\n\nMany liturgical traditionalists in the United States perceived Francis as especially hostile. He denounced the “backwardness” of some American conservatives and derided the formal vestments preferred by many traditionalist priests as “grandma’s lace.”\n\nSome American bishops have enacted new restrictions on the traditional Latin Mass even since Leo became pope. The bishop of Charlotte, N.C., Michael Martin, recently reduced its availability to one designated chapel from four parish churches, drawing outrage from adherents across the country.\n\nBut now, some American advocates for the traditional Latin Mass say they are optimistic that Leo is already setting a less combative tone.\n\n“There’s a different atmosphere,” the Very Rev. Joshua Caswell said in an interview this week. He leads the Canons Regular of St. John Cantius, a religious community based in Chicago that is devoted to what they call “reverent” liturgical forms, including the traditional Latin Mass.\n\nChristian Marquant, of the French traditionalist group Paix Liturgique, attended Saturday’s Mass and said in an interview this week, “My dream, my objective, is to meet the pope” face-to-face to champion the case for the traditional Latin Mass.\n\n“We are a living force inside the church,” said Mr. Casalini, who runs a blog for Italian traditionalists, pointing out that the average age of the participants of Tridentine Masses in Italy was half that of people who attended regular Mass. “All we want to do is celebrate in our own way.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/opinion/slavery-memory-photograph-omar-ibn-said.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"01:00:07-04:00","title":"The Wish to Be Seen","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article centers on Omar ibn Said, a Fula Muslim scholar born in 1770 in Senegal, who was enslaved and transported to the United States.

ibn Said, when I was a young photographer, I felt as if he was speaking to me. I took away one simple instruction: Remember.\n\nBorn in 1770 in what is now Senegal, ibn Said was a member of the Fula people, a devout Muslim and a scholar. When he was 37, he was seized in a raid on his village. He was most likely forced onto a boat that carried him to Saint-Louis, the city that would become the capital of French West Africa, and, eventually, across the Atlantic to Charleston, S.C. He was first enslaved there, and later in North Carolina, where he died in 1863.\n\nI came across ibn Said’s image in the late 1990s during a presentation by the historian Sylviane A. Diouf on her book “Servants of Allah: African Muslims Enslaved in the Americas.” Ms. Diouf spoke about the lives of enslaved Muslims and their efforts toward liberation and self-determination, including writings in Arabic discovered in Panama, Brazil and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.\n\nMemory is a powerful tool of resistance. I believe ibn Said knew that. He wrote an autobiography in Arabic in 1831: one of 18 surviving texts he penned. Together they offer a rare glimpse into the interior life of an African Muslim scholar enslaved in America. Before he was captured, he devoted 25 years to Islamic scholarship, including the study of the Quran, hadith and Sufism. Much of what he wrote in the Carolinas returns to those years. From memory, he wrote verses from the Quran and lines of Sufi poetry on subjects like justice and God’s sole dominion over the earth, composed prayers and drew elaborate geometric talismans. He mentioned his mother, Umm Hani Yarmak, often in this writing. He also referred often to the family who held him until his death — the Owens — and transcribed Christian scripture, without ever explicitly saying he had converted.\n\nIn one letter from 1819, he wrote of his desire to return home: “I wish to be seen in our land called Africa, in a place on the river.”\n\nI’m an African American Muslim woman with family roots in South Carolina. Having grown up in a burgeoning Senegalese community in New York City, I’ve always found the threads of ibn Said’s life — today, well known in academic circles — fascinating. The connection between our histories, our geographies and our spiritual worlds feels close. When I first arrived in Senegal 25 years ago, it felt familiar. I have returned for many reasons: to rest, to learn, for exhibitions and residencies, to continue to photograph and document and to celebrate holidays and birthdays, including my own. Every visit has deepened my understanding of this land and of myself.\n\nIn 1836, ibn Said’s autobiography was sent to a freed Muslim named Lamine Kebe, who was from the same region where ibn Said grew up. Mr. Kebe gave the manuscript to Theodore Dwight, an abolitionist and a founding member of the American Ethnological Society. The manuscript disappeared, only to resurface in the mid-1990s in a trunk in Alexandria, Va. Derrick Beard, a collector of African American ephemera who was himself a descendant of a free Black family who were artisans in Alabama, purchased ibn Said’s Arabic manuscript at Swann Auction Galleries for about $22,000 in 1996.\n\nMr. Beard understood the magnitude of what he held. For years, he safeguarded the manuscript, occasionally loaning it out on exhibition and speaking about it on panels. He even traveled to Senegal to find out more about ibn Said. In 2017, shortly before Mr. Beard died, the Library of Congress bought the manuscript from Sotheby’s according to his wishes, ensuring its preservation and accessibility for future generations.\n\nWhen I hear this story, I think of Zora Neale Hurston and how close her archive came to being lost. After she died and was buried in an unmarked grave, an acquaintance and local sheriff’s deputy in St. Lucie County, Fla., saw her belongings burning, a customary way to dispose of the effects of the poor back then. He rescued many of her papers from the fire, saying he remembered she “was somebody.” Mr. Beard — and so many of us who have since encountered ibn Said’s words and image — recognized he was somebody. His manuscript, once nearly forgotten, now sits in a national archive. It is a testament to the will to be seen.\n\nEarlier this year, I traveled to Senegal to speak at a conference at the Museum of Black Civilizations in Dakar, commemorating the centennial of the birth of Malcolm X. After the conference, I was invited by Drs. Kameelah Mu’Min Oseguera and Mamarame Seck, two academics who are researching ibn Said’s life, to travel north to Futa Toro, his home. I was excited for this invitation to return to the region. We set out for Coppe, recently identified as ibn Said’s likely birthplace by local religious scholars and journalists from Charleston, South Carolina’s Post and Courier. Some scholars are less sure about the exact location of his birth, but we hoped to understand what ties remain between the village and his story.\n\nThe drive from Dakar to the rural village of Coppe took eight hours, carrying us from the forests around the Thiès region in western Senegal to the arid regions of Futa Toro. It led us through Saint-Louis, the Atlantic port known locally as Ndar that linked inland capture routes. One study determined that about 46,600 enslaved people and 277 ships left from Saint-Louis between 1676 and 1832. In 1807, Congress passed the “Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves,” meaning ibn Said was likely on one of the last ships leaving the colonial city for the United States. There, we printed and framed a copy of ibn Said’s original ambrotype portrait, likely one of the few images taken of him, circa 1850. We brought it with us as a gesture of remembrance.\n\nIn Coppe, which has electricity in only one home, we attended Friday prayers, shared a meal with local families and visited the imam. As the sun began to lower, we walked across the dry, cracked clay ground, down to the Senegal River, its current rich with silt. This was the river that once carried so many away from their homes, likely including ibn Said. I asked a few residents of the village to help me compose a photograph. I stood barefoot in a small wooden boat docked along the riverbank, holding ibn Said’s framed image. The river that had cleansed, sustained and witnessed such profound harm, was so calm.\n\nEvery year in Brooklyn, I take part in a seaside convening called “Tribute to the Ancestors of the Middle Passage.” We stand at the edge of the Atlantic in remembrance. I believe our ancestors search for us across time. For me, Omar ibn Said reached out. In that boat in Coppe, holding his image, I reached back. This self-portrait is my way of honoring ibn Said’s wish to return and of acknowledging that his memory, his longing and his witness against the evils of bondage have reached me and so many others.

Cuomo is attempting a late comeback in the New York City mayoral race, trying to attract Republican and independent voters who are disillusioned with both Curtis Sliwa and Zohran Mamdani. Despite historical bipartisan appeal, his campaign has been criticized for late and ineffective outreach, especially in key Republican strongholds like Staten Island and Dyker Heights. His efforts include multiple appearances on conservative media platforms like Fox News and WABC, and controversial AI-generated content depicting Mamdani as a radical. However, political observers and voters alike suggest that the ideological divide between the Democratic and Republican candidates is too wide for Cuomo to gain significant support. Voters like John Keegan, Mark Mastellone, and Steven Scalici express skepticism, with personal and political reasons influencing their choices. Critics argue that Cuomo’s focus on opposing Mamdani’s affordability platform and using inflammatory rhetoric undermines his credibility. Meanwhile, Mamdani has pursued a more inclusive, affordability-focused strategy, appealing to voters who see a need for economic reform. Ultimately, the article highlights a deeply polarized political landscape in NYC, where past loyalty to Trump, personal trauma, and ideological differences are shaping voting behavior.","keyTakeAways":["Andrew M.

Andrew M. Cuomo’s mayoral campaign.\n\nMr. Keegan, 62, is an independent voter who supported President Trump last year, but has been disappointed by Mr. Trump’s second term. He admits to not being enamored with the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, and his lingering allegiance to Mr. Trump means that voting for the Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, is a nonstarter.\n\nThat leaves Mr. Cuomo, right? Mr. Keegan replied with a hard no.\n\n“The reason why New York City is in trouble is because of Cuomo,” Mr. Keegan said. His return to politics was “an insult to the people of New York,” he added, noting the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation in 2021. (Mr. Cuomo has denied the accusations.)\n\nMr. Keegan said he would vote for Mr. Sliwa, though he would have preferred someone a “little bit more polished.”\n\nAs Mr. Cuomo tries to mount a late comeback against Mr. Mamdani, the front-runner, he has taken steps to woo Republicans and right-leaning independent voters. He has made multiple appearances in the Republican stronghold of Staten Island in recent weeks, and has shifted his messaging in ways and in places that seem designed to court Republican voters.\n\nOver the last month, Mr. Cuomo has been a guest on various Fox News programs, and on conservative radio programs on WABC at least six times. Last week, he appeared on a podcast hosted by the influencer Logan Paul, whose popularity has been grounded on a cultural wave of masculinity.\n\nDays earlier on Fox News, Mr. Cuomo said that if people voted for Mr. Sliwa, they “may as well vote for Zohran Mamdani directly.”\n\n“If this city becomes a Zohran Mamdani city, a socialist city,” Mr. Cuomo added. “It’s going to be the death of New York as we know it, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican.”\n\nMr. Cuomo’s campaign seems intent on continuing to court the support of right-leaning New Yorkers, with some of the appeals drawing criticism from fellow Democrats. On Wednesday night, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign posted, then quickly removed, an A.I.-generated video depicting Mr. Mamdani’s supporters as criminals; a critique of how his policies would harm the city. It also depicted Mr. Mamdani eating rice with his hands, a common practice among South Asians, and called him an “inexperienced radical.”\n\nIn a speech on Friday at a mosque in the Bronx, Mr. Mamdani condemned Islamophobic attacks from Mr. Cuomo and other opponents.\n\n“This is Andrew Cuomo’s final moments in public life,” Mr. Mamdani said during an interview on PIX11, “and he’s choosing to spend them making racist attacks on the person who would be the first Muslim to lead this city.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, said the A.I. video was unauthorized and had been put up by a junior staff member who was no longer with the campaign.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s messaging seemed targeted for parts of the city like Staten Island and the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, where Mr. Sliwa’s signs dot the windows of local businesses and Mr. Trump won 66 percent of the vote last year, a 16 percent increase from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDuring an interview on Thursday with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg, Mr. Cuomo talked about reducing the toll on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and helping homeowners on Staten Island rebuild after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nSitting on his stoop in Dyker Heights, Mark Mastellone said he planned to vote for Mr. Sliwa, even as he acknowledged that his candidate would lose the Nov. 4 election.\n\nA political independent who also voted for Mr. Trump, Mr. Mastellone said he was concerned about calls from Mr. Mamdani for higher taxes to support his policy proposals like universal child care. He said he’d only consider a vote for Mr. Cuomo, who is running as an independent, if Mr. Sliwa ended his campaign.\n\n“Since he’s in there,” Mr. Mastellone, 56, a union carpenter, said one recent afternoon, “I’ve got to go with my heart.”\n\nMr. Cuomo’s message — that the city would fall into ruin during a Mamdani mayoralty — was not completely lost on Steven Tsibikos, 63, another Dyker Heights resident.\n\nBut as he walked his beagle-Pekingese mix down a commercial stretch of Dyker Heights, Mr. Tsibikos said his personal appreciation for Mr. Sliwa outweighed any concern about Mr. Mamdani.\n\nA contractor who described himself as a “Reaganite,” Mr. Tsibikos said he appreciated Mr. Sliwa’s approach on crime.\n\n“Sliwa is not a politician, OK? He’s more of a doer,” Mr. Tsibikos argued, adding: “He knows the heart of the city more than the other two combined.”\n\nAside from voters’ skepticism with Mr. Cuomo, political observers think the former governor’s efforts to charm Republican voters are arriving far too late in the race to have a meaningful effect.\n\nJustin Brannan, a Democratic councilman and a Mamdani supporter who represents Bay Ridge, said there was little room for Mr. Cuomo to mine votes in the ideological gap separating Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Sliwa.\n\nMr. Mamdani, he said, has the support of those who want New York City to be “a more affordable place,” while Mr. Sliwa is backed by voters who “think New York City has gone to hell, and the 1950s were the glory days.”\n\nFormer Senator Alfonse D’Amato, a Republican who has previously supported Mr. Cuomo, was more blunt.\n\n“It is over,” Mr. D’Amato said, adding that Mr. Cuomo “has not done anything to attract them, and you got this other jackass running on the Republican line. The hard cores will stay with him. It’s hopeless.”\n\nMr. Cuomo seems unpersuaded. His efforts to push Mr. Sliwa to drop out and for Republicans and independents to vote for him have ramped up, with the start of early voting on Saturday. Polls show that the gap between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Mamdani would decrease considerably if the election was a one-on-one contest between the two.\n\nIn his earlier runs for statewide office, Mr. Cuomo regularly courted Republican voters. There was a “Republicans for Cuomo” group and a steady stream of endorsements from prominent Republicans, including Mr. D’Amato.\n\nThe New York Times reported in August that Mr. Cuomo had spoken to Mr. Trump about the race for mayor. Mr. Trump has consistently disparaged Mr. Sliwa’s campaign, saying recently on Fox News that he was not a viable candidate and questioning whether he was “really a Republican.”\n\nDuring Wednesday night’s debate, Mr. Mamdani called Mr. Cuomo “Donald Trump’s puppet.”\n\nAndrew Stein, a former New York City Council president and a decades-long friend of Mr. Trump, said he expected Mr. Trump to signal to his supporters that they should back Mr. Cuomo, even if they do not like his entire record.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s hopes lie in voters like Carmen Rojas, a registered Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump last year, and Steven Scalici, a resident of Staten Island’s South Shore, who are both skeptical of Mr. Sliwa.\n\nMs. Rojas, a Dyker Heights resident, said she objected strongly to Mr. Mamdani because she was born in Venezuela, where the country’s economy collapsed in recent years under an authoritarian, socialism-inspired government. As a result, she would not support anyone who identifies as a socialist. She likes Mr. Sliwa but believes that “he doesn’t have a chance” to win the election.\n\n“It’s a tough one,” Ms. Rojas, 67, said. “I’m going to go with Cuomo.”\n\nMr. Scalici, 69, has been torn between support for Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Sliwa.\n\nMr. Scalici’s father was murdered in 1981, and the killer was released on parole after decades in prison, he said. He blamed Mr. Cuomo for changing the ideological complexion of the parole board, making it easier for the man to win his release.\n\n“This vote has to be more than just about me,” Mr. Scalici said. “One is a long-shot, perpetual candidate, the other is a guy who kind of stinks, but he is a mature man.”\n\nMr. Cuomo is not the only Democrat reaching out to Republican and independent voters. Mr. Mamdani has made several recent campaign stops on Staten Island, where he was met by protesters at one event, and he appeared on Fox News before the first debate.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s criticism of the pricing of World Cup tickets and appearances on several sports podcasts is part of his outreach to disaffected young, male voters. On the “I’ve Had It” podcast, Mr. Mamdani said his campaign was seeing interest from New York City residents who voted for Mr. Trump last year.\n\nHe believes his campaign’s strict focus on affordability cuts across ideological lines.\n\n“I think part of our posture has been, we welcome anyone to join this movement,” Mr. Mamdani said on the podcast. “We don’t ask them where they’ve been or why they haven’t joined yet.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/europe/ukraine-fire-point-drones-flamingo.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-26","timeOfPublication":"06:53:03-04:00","title":"3 Years Ago It Was a Casting Agency.

Now It Has $1 Billion in Drone Contracts.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-26T06:53:03-04:00\n\nIf Silicon Valley start-ups began in garages, the origin story of Ukraine’s defense start-ups lies in basements. There, many workshops cobbled together drones from off-the-shelf parts, going underground to avoid Russian missiles.\n\nThese once small-scale, volunteer-run outfits are now transforming into defense corporations, in a process encouraged by the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky to scale up innovations. Among the companies, one stands out to both its supporters and its critics for the speed and scale of its rise: an emerging drone-manufacturing giant called Fire Point.\n\nAt the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, the business that became Fire Point was a casting agency for film and television productions, according to Ukrainian government registration documents. Its legally listed owner, Yehor Skalyha, is the chief executive of another company, At Point, that scouts film locations. Fire Point’s chief technology officer, Iryna Terekh, previously ran a company that made concrete outdoor furniture.\n\nNow, the company is one of the largest contractors for the Ukrainian military, with $1 billion in contracts this year, according to its executives. At about 30 secret locations in Ukraine, Fire Point churns out long-range exploding drones using cheap materials like Styrofoam, plywood, plastic and a type of carbon fiber intended for racing bicycles.\n\nThose drones are being used in a major campaign against Russian oil refineries that is intended to inflict economic damage on Russia and give Ukraine leverage in peace talks. The company says it is also ramping up production of a larger, longer-range weapon, called the Flamingo, that officials hope will bolster Ukraine’s ability to strike deep inside Russia.\n\nBut as Fire Point has raced ahead of a crowded field to become a national aerospace champion, the company has been dogged by accusations that it used connections to win contracts, and its executives have acknowledged being questioned in an anticorruption investigation.\n\nMuch of Ukraine’s military spending is cloaked in wartime secrecy, with billions of dollars channeled to domestic arms makers as Kyiv moves away from relying on donations from international allies. In a country with a long history of corruption in defense procurement, analysts and activists have raised concerns about how the Ukrainian government is awarding military contracts and where the profits are going.\n\nFire Point emerged from the same Ukrainian film and television industry where Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, worked before his election as president in 2019. The film scouting company led by Fire Point’s owner was credited with location work for a 2016 romantic comedy starring Mr. Zelensky, “Eight Best Dates.” It has also worked on dozens of other productions unrelated to the president’s former film career.\n\nA newspaper, The Kyiv Independent, reported in August that Ukraine’s National Anticorruption Agency was examining ties between Fire Point and a businessman, Timur Mindich, who is a half owner of a television studio started by Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe newspaper said the agency was investigating whether Mr. Mindich was receiving Fire Point profits as an unnamed owner. Fire Point said that Mr. Mindich had asked to buy stock in the company, but that the owners had declined to sell.\n\nFire Point executives said that they were cooperating with the anticorruption inquiry and that it was focused not on their company, but on government officials. A spokesman for the anticorruption agency declined to comment.\n\nThe company has also been accused of receiving favorable treatment despite problems with the quality of its drones that critics say have made them less successful than other Ukrainian options in penetrating Russian air defenses.\n\nThe Public Anticorruption Council, an independent group watching over defense procurement, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into accusations of quality and pricing problems.\n\nFire Point says that its initial quality problems have been ironed out and that its main drone, the FP-1, is now reliably blowing up Russian refining equipment, starting fires and causing mayhem, as it was designed to do. That claim could not be independently verified.\n\nEven as questions have been raised about Ukraine’s military contracting, drone manufacturers like Fire Point have been embraced as national heroes. The country’s quick adaptation of drones with commercially available components has evened the odds against Russia’s far larger army and swayed military analysts’ views of the future of war.\n\nAs Ukraine’s once patriotically driven drone shops rapidly commercialize, they are catching the attention of potential investors and Western joint venture partners. Norway and Ukraine this month announced a 20 million euro (around $23 million) fund for angel investments in Norwegian and Ukrainian drone start-ups.\n\n“Nobody in the world has so much experience in unmanned missions,” Oleksandr Kamyshin, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky on strategic industries, said of Ukraine’s drone war. He added that Ukraine’s emerging industry should form joint ventures with Western defense contractors. “These drones are something you need in Europe and the United States,” he said.\n\nUkraine’s Ministry of Strategic Industries reports that 425 arms manufacturing companies opened in the country from 2022 to 2024. A separate estimate by Brave 1, a branch of the Ministry of Digital Transformation encouraging military innovation, said that more than 2,000 companies in Ukraine were now designing or making weapons.\n\nJust in the sector of long-range strike drones — the type that Fire Point makes — Ukraine has more than 20 competing companies, said Ihor Fedirko, the director of the Council of Defense Industries, a trade group.\n\nFire Point’s FP-1 drone resembles a miniature airplane. It blasts off with a rocket-assisted start and is powered by a two-stroke engine like those on chain saws. It flies about 850 miles and carries a 130-pound warhead. Though made from inexpensive materials, the drone is capable of hitting much of western Russia.\n\nUkraine’s approach to long-range drones was first pioneered by Russia using low-cost Iranian-designed models. The tactic, and the business associated with it, is about volume. Most of the drones are intercepted, which means they must remain cheap. But some get through, and unlike an airplane, an exploding drone has to work only once.\n\nFire Point says that its drones now conduct 60 percent of Ukraine’s attacks inside Russia. The Ukrainian military’s drone strikes have put Russia, a country that has prided itself on its air defenses going back to the Cold War, under daily bombardment.\n\nThe company’s contracts this year make up about 10 percent of Ukraine’s defense procurement spending. The government taps opened even though Fire Point avoided a legally mandated price negotiation during contracting, according to a government audit.\n\nProcurement officers had estimated, based on costs for parts and labor, that Fire Point’s FP-1 drone could be produced more cheaply than its offering price in December 2024 of about $58,000 per unit.\n\nThat assessment should have triggered a negotiation by Ukraine’s Defense Procurement Agency but did not, auditors found. Without that negotiation, contracts were awarded for about $16.7 million more than the lower-cost option for producing the drones, auditors said.\n\nIn interviews, company executives said that the price of their drones was already rock-bottom for a weapon duplicating abilities of cruise missiles that cost more than $1 million each.\n\nMaj. Yurii Kasyanov, a former drone unit commander, said in an interview that Fire Point had won contracts despite design flaws, while a model he designed, called the Spear, was ignored.\n\nHis drone was passed over, he said, despite his having demonstrated the model’s jamming-proof guidance system by exploding two drones in 2023 yards away from the flag flying over the Kremlin in Moscow.\n\nMajor Kasyanov said that he had testified as a witness in the anticorruption investigation related to Fire Point, and that afterward, the military had disbanded his drone unit.\n\nIn response to the quality questions, Ms. Terekh, 33, Fire Point’s chief technology officer, said that manufacturing drones should be seen as a new industry that breaks quality standards in aircraft manufacturing for the sake of economy.\n\nIn addition to the FP-1 drone, Fire Point says it is increasing output of the Flamingo, a larger, heavier craft with a jet engine, a range of about 1,800 miles and a one-ton warhead. David H. Petraeus, a former Army general and C.I.A. director, has called the Flamingo a potential “game changer” in the war.\n\nThe Flamingo’s effectiveness has yet to be tested at scale. Also something of a mystery is its name.\n\nMs. Terekh said engineers had painted one prototype pink, leading to the name. The bright color was intended to aid a search for debris after a test firing, and the company was out of red paint, she said.\n\nAnother account holds that the pink coloring was an error and that engineers had joked: “What is the worst that can happen if a woman is in charge of a defense company? The weapons will be pink.”\n\nOleksandr Chubko and Nataliia Novosolova contributed reporting.\n\n"}]}
