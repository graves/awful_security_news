celebrates Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary with California event that sparks back-and-forth with Newsom \n       \n  By Isabelle D’Antonio, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:15 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps on Saturday at a California event that drew some pushback from Gov. Gavin Newsom over a live artillery demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp Pendleton demonstration, which the Marines called the largest in a decade in the continental US, involved fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom, a Democrat who has  frequently sparred  with the Trump administration, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s office disputed the claim that the demonstration was dangerous. William Martin, Vance’s communications director, said in a statement to CNN that the Marine Corps deemed the demonstration “an established and safe practice” and “part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.”\n \n\n   \n  “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said. “It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Camp Pendleton, Vance — the first Marine to serve as vice president — spoke of his time in the military, saying, “I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance  enlisted in the military  after high school, spending four years in the Marines and serving a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks, he also focused on the Trump administration’s  campaign against  “woke” aspects of the military. “It is not our diversity that makes us stronger,” Vance said. “It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who took the podium before Vance, made a similar argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I look out at this crowd, I see a lot of different types of faces. The truth is your diversity is not your strength. Never has been,” Hegseth said. “Your strength is in your unity of purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Pentagon has cracked down on diversity initiatives and rolled back efforts made over the last decade attempting to eradicate toxic culture in the military.\n \n\n   \n  During Saturday’s celebration, Vance also delivered a message from the president, acknowledging the  weekslong government shutdown  but placing blame on Democrats — particularly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n \n\n   \n  “I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J. Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he’s proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, as thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or are working without pay, the Department of Defense is  continuing to pay troops  by using “unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israeli-hostage-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:11:00-04:00","title":"Hamas returns bodies of two hostages as US State Department issues warning against breaking ceasefire","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas has returned two additional bodies of deceased hostages to Israel, bringing the total to 12 out of 28 promised under the ceasefire agreement.

breaking ceasefire \n       \n  By Ibrahim Dahman, Mitchell McCluskey, Lauren Izso, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:11 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel received the bodies of two deceased hostages on Saturday as the  Gaza ceasefire  comes under growing strain.\n \n\n   \n  The remains, which Hamas handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza, were transferred to Israel for formal identification, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency (ISA) said in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  The truce in Gaza appears to be largely holding as it entered its second week, but has come under pressure from the delayed return of the remaining hostage bodies from Gaza, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and Israel’s continued deadly strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department said Saturday that “credible reports” indicate that Hamas is planning an “imminent ceasefire violation” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the media note said. “The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the State Department’s memo.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Saturday, Hamas had only returned 10 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement with Israel that went into effect last week.\n \n\n   \n  Protests have ignited in Israel as frustration  intensifies  over the delay in returning the bodies of the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, large crowds of demonstrators gathered on Saturday, urging the government to pressure Hamas to release the bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access and that “extensive efforts and special equipment” would be needed to retrieve more. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Israel believes  that Hamas  does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. Israel’s foreign minister has accused Hamas of trying to use the hostages’ bodies as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Channel 14 on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would end once all of the hostage bodies have been returned and Hamas is demilitarized.\n \n\n   \n  “The war in Gaza will finally end when the terms of the agreement that was supposedly accepted are implemented, and this includes, first of all, Phase A - the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Phase B also includes the disarmament of Hamas, or rather the disarmament of the Strip, and before that the disarmament of Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n    Rafah crossing and crucial aid\n \n\n   \n  As the dispute continues, the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday. The crossing is a  crucial link  between Egypt and Gaza, serving as the enclave’s lifeline for humanitarian aid.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s office said that its opening would be dependent on how “Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas criticized the delayed reopening of the crossing as “a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.” The group also condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military targeted a vehicle carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, on Friday after it crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  After coordinating with the United Nations, Gaza’s civil defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the civil defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/caribbean-boat-strike-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-04:00","title":"US Releasing Survivors of Strike on Suspected Drug Vessel to Their Home Countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. is releasing two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia, under President Donald Trump.

\n        7:59 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US is releasing the  two survivors  of Thursday’s  military strike  on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia, President Donald Trump said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said it was his “great honor” to destroy a drug-carrying submarine with “four known narcoterrorists on board,” two of whom were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” he posted on Truth Social. “Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea.”\n \n\n   \n  Colombia has received one of of the survivors, President Gustavo Petro said Saturday evening. “We received the Colombian detained in the narco submarine,” Petro wrote on X. “We are glad that he is alive and he will be processed in accordance with the laws.”\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Ministry of the Interior said Saturday that it received one of the survivors. Authorities told CNN the survivor “is being medically evaluated.” They added that “the corresponding legal process will follow” and gave no further details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier Saturday that the US was considering releasing the survivors to their home countries. Administration officials were scrambling to determine what to do with the individuals, the first known survivors of the six US military strikes carried out in the Caribbean since September.\n \n\n   \n  The US military detained the survivors after the strike Thursday, marking the first time the Trump administration’s campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s strike was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. It came as the US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as promises further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the prisoners, Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources told CNN the legally dubious situation is why the administration was considering releasing the individuals from US military custody.\n \n\n   \n  The situation comes as legality of the Trump administration’s operations in the Caribbean has been widely questioned.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona, Max Saltman, Ana María Cañizares, Anabella González and Isabel Tejera contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-body-from-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:27:00-04:00","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Tenth Hostage as Delicate Truce Enters Second Week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement.

75-year-old man as delicate truce enters second week \n       \n  By Oren Liebermann, Mitchell McCluskey, Ibrahim Dahman and Eugenia Yosef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:27 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a tenth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza under the recent ceasefire deal has been identified as the truce entered a second week despite facing a number of tests and with the next steps unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, of blessed memory,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz, or village, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the identity of Margalit, who was 75 at the time he was killed in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 two years ago. His body was later taken to Gaza, the Israeli military said.\n \n\n   \n  “We will always remember him as a kind-hearted man whose world was filled with family, kibbutz, nature, and animals,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  There are now 18 deceased hostages left in Gaza following the return of Margalit’s body.\n \n\n   \n  Frustration has  intensified  in Israel over the delay in returning the bodies of remaining hostages, a condition outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that went into effect last week.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Israel  believes  that Hamas does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter, and Israel’s Foreign Minister has accused Hamas of trying to use them as bargaining chips.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, has previously called for help, saying on Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages.\n \n\n   \n  In that statement, al-Qassam Brigades said it has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n    Ceasefire holds despite killings\n \n\n   \n  For the moment, both sides appear to believe the ceasefire in Gaza is holding though not without coming under strain from the failure of Hamas to return all the bodies, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and continued, if isolated, incidents of killings of Palestinians in Israeli strikes.\n \n\n   \n  A Palestinian family travelling back to their home in the north of the Gaza were killed by the Israeli military on Friday after their vehicle crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle was carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, Basal said. After coordinating with the United Nations, Gaza’s civil defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the civil defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire with such killings, but no retaliatory action was taken as of Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has also allowed more aid to enter in recent days but aid groups are calling for the opening of more crossings to improve deliveries.\n \n\n   \n  The World Food Programme said on Friday that it has not been able to bring enough food into Gaza because conditions are “extremely difficult”, including communities being on the move, the parlous road conditions, and the fact only two border crossings are open.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafah border crossing, a key gateway that connects Gaza to Egypt, has yet to open.\n \n\n   \n  The crossing was set to open to civilian traffic in both directions as part of the ceasefire agreement, but Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said on Thursday that the date of the opening “will be announced at a later stage.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s Foreign Minister said last week it could open on Sunday. But on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said it would remain closed until further notice, adding that the crossing’s opening would be subject to Hamas meeting the terms of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Its opening will be considered depending on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline,” a statement from his office said.\n \n\n   \n    Phase Two\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations on the crucial next stages of the ceasefire deal began in Egypt last week, an Israeli source and a regional official told CNN, with the talks focusing on the demilitarization of Gaza, governance of the strip and the formation of an international force to help secure the enclave after two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  A 20-point plan presented by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza states that the enclave will be administered by a non-political technocratic group of Palestinians and an overseeing body called the ‘Board of Peace’ - set to be chaired by United States President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  An International Stabilization Force (ISF) made up of troops from several countries will be constructed to secure the strip, according to the plan.\n \n\n   \n  But even though Hamas dispatched its chief negotiator to Cairo for discussions over the Palestinian committee set to govern Gaza, the militant group remains vague over its disarmament and transfer of power.\n \n\n   \n  And countries set to join the International Stabilization Force are still negotiating its structure, with some asking for a mandate from the UN Security Council before joining.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Izso contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:57:00.000Z","title":"Six Universities Reject White House Funding Deal with Attached Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Six major universities — including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — have rejected a White House proposal offering expanded federal funding in exchange for significant policy changes.

funding deal with attached demands. Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:57 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  After a meeting at the White House Friday, the University of Virginia declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of five schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  USC, Penn, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an unprecedented level of control over universities – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, six have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n   Vanderbilt University  and the University of Arizona have said they are reviewing the compact, with Arizona’s president saying the “proposal has generated a wide range of reactions and perspectives.” Neither of the schools have indicated if they are planning to sign on or not.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/uk/analysis-royal-prince-andrew-titles-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew Gives Up Royal Titles in Major Scandal Move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has formally given up all royal titles, including the Duke of York, in a move that effectively ends his public role in the royal family.

October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Perhaps the question is not why now, but why it hadn’t happened sooner.\n \n\n   \n  In a move that cements his banishment from royal life,  Prince Andrew  announced he was relinquishing the use of his royal titles and honors, and would no longer be known as the Duke of York.\n \n\n   \n  The decision, announced Friday, was made in close consultation with  Britain’s King Charles III , who is believed to be glad at the outcome, while Prince William and other members of the royal family were also consulted on the discussions, CNN understands.\n \n\n   \n  Along with his statement, Andrew also continued to once again “vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\n \n\n   \n  Dukedom is the highest rank in the British peerage, and the title was given to Andrew on the morning of his wedding to  ex-wife Sarah Ferguson  by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. The announcement on Friday evening draws a line once and for all, without having to go through the messy machinations of a parliamentary intervention, which would have been required to remove the dukedom.\n \n\n   \n  The relinquishment of such a title within the British royal family is incredibly rare.\n \n\n   \n  The last instance is understood to be over 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward, who was one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons, had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for fighting for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, during World War I.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew still retains the title “prince,” bestowed on him at birth as the son of the then reigning monarch. But he is giving up all other titles conferred on him in honor by the royal family. For a man who clearly relishes his status, this is no small loss.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew stepped down from public life in 2019 following a disastrous BBC interview in which he was questioned about his friendship with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, in 2022, he  stopped  using the style His Royal Highness, or HRH, and was stripped of his military titles and charity patronages.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the fallout from his association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial in the United States on federal charges of sexually abusing underage girls, has continued to plague him.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s decision is thought to be Andrew’s own, and was made in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continue to be a distraction from the wider work of the royal family, his statement Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  While it appears to have been his choice, he – and the rest of the Windsor clan – were facing mounting pressure to resolve the situation. CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams said Andrew had become “toxic to the royal brand.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a signal that… we will not see him in family events, we are not going to see him when there’s a big celebration for King Charles’s 80th birthday in a couple of years; Andrew is out of the fold,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, is this enough to stop the backlash overall tainting the royal family?”\n \n\n   \n  Williams believes a question mark now hangs over Andrew’s continued residence in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor, although he has a private tenancy agreement for the property with the Crown Estate which has not been affected by the change in use of titles and honors, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  The thorny issue of what do with Andrew has loomed over the King since he ascended to the throne in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Charles’ dilemma was one perhaps unique to royals. Andrew is both his brother and a senior member of an ancient institution.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has largely stayed out of the limelight since 2019 and has only generally attended private family events – one of the most recent being the  Duchess of Kent ’s funeral service, at which he was accompanied by Sarah Ferguson.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, this step-back from public life has done little to stop the headlines.\n \n\n   \n  His links to Epstein have remained in the spotlight, with the prince facing fresh backlash during the 2021 sex trafficking trial of disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, when one of her accusers named Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, multiple British news outlets reported on an email which appeared to raise questions over Andrew’s stated timeline regarding when he cut off contact with Epstein. Similarly, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who will now no longer use the title Duchess of York, has faced backlash in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Files from Epstein’s estate continue to be released by the US House Oversight Committee and there has been media speculation as to whether Andrew’s name will feature in those.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had previously alleged that she had been forced to have sex with the prince after being trafficked by Epstein, is due to be published in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had repeatedly denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault. She died by suicide in April at age 41.\n \n\n   \n  The book’s release comes in the same week that King Charles and Queen Camilla are headed to the Vatican for a historic state visit.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein aside, Andrew has also faced questions over his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy, named by a British court in December as Yang Tengbo. Yang is alleged to have worked for China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a branch of the ruling Communist Party tasked with gaining influence both at home and overseas. A court hearing described Yang as having developed an “unusual degree of trust” with the younger brother of King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  In April this year, a 10-page document on Andrew’s relations with Yang was  released  by British courts.\n \n\n   \n  It seems the palace realized that the institution’s reputation was continuing to be impacted by the disgraced prince despite the previous moves to remove him as a working royal, which may be why further internal discussions took place, leading to Friday’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  There will be those – including monarchy-abolishment campaign group Republic who described the move as “too little, too late” – who say palace should have acted sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts  told CNN  that “this is what my sister was fighting for for so many years,” following the news that Andrew had given up using his remaining titles.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a day where we’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears. Happy because it’s a good start,” he said. “Her kids get to know their mom as somebody that really did something in this world, that she actually spread a lot of good and was able to hold people to account.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/soccer-premier-league-ange-postecoglou-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"10:58:00-04:00","title":"Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou fired after just 39 days at Premier League club","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ange Postecoglou, the Australian football manager, was dismissed by Nottingham Forest just 39 days after being appointed, following a string of poor results including a 3-0 loss to Chelsea.

George Santos released from prison after Trump commutes his sentence \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Kaanita Iyer, Fadel Allassan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:44 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgraced former Rep. George Santos,  who had been serving a seven-year term  for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, was released from prison on Friday night after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence, his lawyer tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump first announced the commutation on Truth Social on Friday evening, and, according to attorney Joseph Murray, Santos’ family picked him up from the prison about five hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” the president wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s commutation comes just months after Santos, 37, surrendered on July 25 to serve  87 months in prison .\n \n\n   \n   Before he surrendered, Santos told Saudi outlet Al Arabiya English that he asked Trump for a pardon but believed he “got stonewalled.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it made it to the president,” Santos said of his pardon request at the time. “Unfortunately, gatekeepers have blockaded for it to ever get to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  But even from behind bars, Santos continued to make his case.  According to his verified X page , he wrote an open letter to Trump earlier this week, pleading for “fairness” while also saying he takes “full responsibility” for his actions.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness — for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires,” Santos wrote in  the letter published in The South Shore Press. \n \n\n   \n  The law firm that represented Santos celebrated the president’s move, telling CNN, “We applaud the President for correcting this injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  Murray  posted on X  a message on behalf of Santos thanking GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -who he said “fought like a lion” for him – as well as  Lauren Boebert , Anna Paulina Luna, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom he described as “in regular contact.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos also expressed gratitude to “the greatest DOJ team ever assembled”, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Associated Deputy AG Diego Pestana, and US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, among other. Martin  wrote on X  he was “honored” to have played “a small role” in Trump granting “clemency” to Santos, and thanked the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the commutation drew mixed reaction from lawmakers. Taylor Greene — who wrote a letter to Trump in August asking him to commute Santos’ sentence — also thanked the president in a  post on X , adding that Santos “was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, slammed Trump for focusing on Santos instead of Americans’ health care — an issue at the center of the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has time to free serial fraudster George Santos from prison. But he can’t be bothered to address the Republican healthcare crisis crushing working class Americans,” Jeffries said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the former congressman pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges stemming from activity during his 2022 midterm campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I deeply regret my conduct,” Santos said in court at that time. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023, before completing a full term in the US House – becoming only the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  During his short time in Congress, reports emerged of Santos having fabricated parts of his biography, including his employment history and education. He  eventually admitted to  doing that.\n \n\n   \n  Santos represented parts of Long Island and Queens and attempted to run in another New York district before pleading guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Santos had been serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, per the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-power-iaea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Work underway to restore power at Ukrainian nuclear plant as UN announces rare local ‘ceasefire zones’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare ceasefire zones between Russian and Ukrainian forces.

Both sides engaged constructively with the IAEA to enable complex repair plan to proceed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Apart from the regular exchanges of prisoners, the fighting in Ukraine has rarely eased in the three-year conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Neither side confirmed the local truce, but Ukraine’s energy ministry said Ukrainian specialists were working to restore the power lines on Saturday, the 42nd round of repair works since Russia’s full-scale invasion.\n \n\n   \n  “The only reason for the unprecedented risks and threat of a radiation incident in Europe is Russian military aggression, the occupation of the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhya NPP and the systematic shelling of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,” the ministry said in a Telegram post.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian-controlled power plant said in a post on Telegram that staff were carrying out restoration works, adding the Russian defense ministry was playing a “key role” in ensuring that the “work can be carried out in an area under active shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.”\n \n\n   \n  “Without the security guarantees provided by the military, the work of the power engineers would be impossible,” the post said.\n \n\n   \n  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost connection to its sole remaining power line last month, forcing the plant to run on emergency diesel generators for over 20 days, the  IAEA reported .\n \n\n   \n  Both sides traded accusations over the outage. Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha accused Russia of “intentionally” cutting the electricity supply to the nuclear plant to test reconnection with the Russian grid. Russia said the blackout was caused by Ukrainian shelling.\n \n\n   \n  The blackout at the power plant, occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war, marked the tenth time the site lost connection to the grid since the military conflict began, according to the IAEA.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has continued to carry out strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Two weeks ago, a Russian strike on a Ukrainian energy substation in the city of Slavutych caused a blackout that lasted more than three hours at the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky accused Moscow of a “deliberate strike” that involved “more than 20 drones,” stating that “the Russians could not have been unaware that striking facilities in Slavutych would have such consequences for Chernobyl.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tim Lister and Gul Tuysuz contributed reporting \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/entertainment/israel-palestine-boycott-javier-bardem","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"There’s a ceasefire — but Hollywood’s fight over Israel and Gaza still rages","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a fragile ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities actively and publicly expressing opposing views.

\nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Over the last two years, many big-name celebrities have made noise on behalf of a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Now that a ceasefire —  no matter how fragile it may be  — has been reached, the tensions in Hollywood show no signs of ending. In this heated environment, even what you post online, and when you post it, is fodder.\n \n\n   \n  Erin Foster, creator of Netflix’s hit series “Nobody Wants This,” went on Instagram this week to ask: “I’m not sure why everyone is being so utterly quiet today, but there is a deal in place that will finally bring peace to Palestinians. Why are you not celebrating it?”\n \n\n   \n  “After 2 years of screaming ‘Ceasefire Now!!’ It is clear that was never the issue. It was eradicating Israel,” actress Debra Messing wrote on her Instagram this week. (Messing is one of Hollywood’s most vocal pro-Israel voices.) “The silence of the ‘Free Palestine’ movement is sickening,” she re-posted. “Your silence makes it unavoidably obvious that it’s only about terrorizing Jews.”\n \n\n   \n  Pro-Palestinian and anti-war celebrities have used red carpets, award shows and their social media accounts to keep focus on the people of Palestine. Mark Ruffalo, for one, reposted a message this week from Film Workers for Palestine that said, “We share in the relief of Palestinians in Gaza that Israel’s relentless slaughter may be coming to an end.” A week ago, he also reposted a note from the group Artists4Ceasefire that expressed hope about the ceasefire and for the return of hostages to Israel. He was among those criticized for not marking the return of the Israeli hostages since they were released earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Cynthia Nixon, similarly, had posted a message to “Free all the hostages and Free Palestine” on October 9, but pro-Israel activists said that she didn’t acknowledge the return of Israeli civilian hostages. These activists also suggested that none of these celebrities spoke up about Hamas executing Palestinians in the streets of Gaza this week.\n \n\n   \n  The execution-style killings of Palestinians in Gaza has a potential to trigger an unraveling of the ceasefire. President Donald  Trump warned  Hamas this week that “We will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” in  an escalation of rhetoric  during this brittle moment.\n \n\n   \n  “Celebrities that have been so outspoken and so engaged with this conflict and calling out Israel almost on a daily basis have all gone quiet about the brutal murder of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire began,” says Hen Mazzig, senior fellow at the pro-Israel Tel Aviv institute, which utilizes influencers online to enact opinion change about both Jews and Israel. He made the claim that these activists didn’t care about Palestinians but were only using the cause to attack Israel, saying that “the mask was off”: “We know exactly what they stand for and we know exactly what it was all about — I think it’s clear it was about using their platform to attack Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Bardem — who has been one of Hollywood’s biggest critics of Israel and most passionate advocates for Palestinians — spoke to CNN about the executions specifically.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, I am completely against the execution of anyone including Palestinians by Hamas. It is an atrocious act of violence,” Bardem said in a statement, speaking on the matter for the first time. “Everyone deserves a fair trial where the accusations are shown and proven, and only then be rightfully accountable by a fair law that obviously does not include execution.”\n \n\n   \n    The boycott that will pit studios and talent against each other\n \n\n   \n  Bardem is one of nearly 4,000 Hollywood figures who signed a pledge last month to boycott Israeli film institutions. The pledge said that Israel’s filmmaking industry is “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  On the Emmys red carpet last month, Bardem wore a keffiyeh and did a series of interviews to support the people of Palestine, telling   Variety , “I cannot work with somebody that justifies or supports the genocide. That’s as simple as that. And we shouldn’t be able to do that, in this industry or any other industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli film boycott, organized last month by Film Workers for Palestine, drew support from a substantial number of A-listers, including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Ayo Edebiri, Ilana Glazer, Susan Sarandon, Ruffalo, Nixon and Bardem.  (A representative for Nixon did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Ruffalo’s representative said he was unavailable and in production overseas.)\n \n\n   \n  The boycott prompted an open letter from a different group of Hollywood artists, including Liev Schreiber, Gene Simmons, Sharon Osbourne, Jerry O’Connell, Howie Mandel, Mayim Bialik and Messing who denounced the call to stop working with Israeli film institutions over the war in Gaza, stating that the letter promotes “censorship and the erasure of art.”\n \n\n   \n  Paramount and Warner Bros. – which are both under the leadership of pro-Israel CEOs in David Ellison and David Zaslav, respectively – have issued statements taking a clear stand against the Israel film boycott, in a strong and rare public position from two major Hollywood studios. (Warner Bros. shares the same parent company as CNN.)\n \n\n   \n  Now, they will have to contend with thousands of artists in the creative community who disagree with their company’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  Bardem told CNN that the Film Workers for Palestine pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions is about holding institutions accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “I want this to be very clear. We do not discriminate against any person based on their nationality, race, religion, or gender,” Bardem told CNN. “We of course believe discrimination of any kind is wrong and do not support that and have continued to reiterate this. We support holding companies and institutions all over the world accountable, not individuals, for their complicity and participation in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the illegal settlement of the West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  A representative for Artists4Ceasefire – which was the first advocacy group to galvanize prominent celebrities to call for a ceasefire after October 7, 2023 – declined to participate in an interview with CNN about next steps for the movement now that a ceasefire deal has been reached, but provided a statement about their mission of achieving a permanent ceasefire. (The representative also declined to identify who runs the organization, saying that “we are a collective of artists and advocates.”)\n \n\n   \n  That group is behind the red pins that many celebrities – from Ruffalo to comedian Ramy Youssef to singer Billie Eilish – wore on the Oscars red carpet, symbolizing solidarity with Palestinian people. Roughly 500 celebrities and Hollywood artists signed the Artists4Ceasefire petition in 2023; dozens of industry A-listers signed an  Artists4Ceasefire letter  addressed to then-President Biden, urging the White House for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Our call remains the same as it has been since October 2023: a permanent ceasefire, a return of all hostages, and the immediate, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza,” said the Artists4Ceasefire representative in a statement. “This is the beginning of what is required for healing, rebuilding and a just and lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches to see if a ceasefire will hold and bring peace, Hollywood, usually more unified on social justice issues, will continue to wrestle both in public and in private.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a ceasefire, but I would say that it is far from resolved,” said Tatiana Siegel, executive editor of film and media at Variety. “I’ve talked to a lot of studio executives who tell me that they are very aware of who signed what and are not eager to work with people that they strongly disagree with. This was a situation where everyone in Hollywood became a Middle Eastern expert overnight and was chiming in with their opinions one way or another on social media.”\n \n\n   \n  Already over the past two years, stars have been dropped from agencies and fired from franchises over this conflict. “A lot of people feel angry about what they saw,” said Siegel. “Where do we go from here?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/ukraine-russia-advances-aerial-bombardment-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00-04:00","title":"Russian forces, aided by heavy aerial bombardments, edge forward in Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a recent call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces are continuing to advance across multiple fronts in Ukraine, including in Kupiansk, Vovchansk, and near Pokrovsk.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:23 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a  combat freeze  along existing lines.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC.\n \n\n   \n  But the Russians seem intent on locking in gains before the onset of winter. On Friday, they used a record 268 guided aerial bombs, according to the Ukrainian military, compared to an average of 170 to 180 per day in recent weeks. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians have also continued  nightly barrages  of drones and missiles against targets across Ukraine, especially against energy infrastructure. In September, an average of more than 180 drones were launched every night, more than twice the number at the beginning of the year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% are not being intercepted.\n \n\n   \n  To some analysts, the Kremlin has no incentive to compromise.\n \n\n   \n  “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot  in Foreign Affairs .\n \n\n   \n  “It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds.\n \n\n   \n  One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. About 80 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, the Ukrainian military acknowledged on Thursday, and its defenders were “doing everything possible to clear Kupiansk of Russian invaders and prevent the accumulation of enemy infantry in the city.”\n \n\n   \n  One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.”\n \n\n   \n  Also in Kharkiv region, closer to the international border, the Russians have claimed advances near the town of Vovchansk, including the capture of a nearby village.\n \n\n   \n  In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. For its part, the Ukrainian military has claimed to have recovered some 70 square miles of territory in the Pokrovsk area over the past two months, in a series of counterattacks.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, insisted Friday that the Russians did not have “the strategic initiative. At the cost of enormous losses, the adversary has achieved only minor advances in certain sections of the front.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy’s spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.\n \n\n   \n  And Russian advances come at great cost. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an  estimate  in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine’s military command. CNN cannot verify battlefield figures.\n \n\n   \n  In the face of these losses, the Russian defense ministry appears to be changing the way it recruits additional personnel.

Phoenix in 1993 \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona’s  second execution of the year .\n \n\n   \n  Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\n \n\n   \n  His execution was the  fourth in the country this week  and the 39th of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\n \n\n   \n  Djerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  No representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\n \n\n   \n  It took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  Barcello said Djerf’s veins “were not optimal” and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n \n\n   \n  “By all accounts the process went according to plan and without any incident,” Barcello said. A month ago, Djerf  released a statement  in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\n \n\n   \n  The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\n \n\n   \n  There was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with  15 doses  of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\n \n\n   \n  Executions resumed in 2022, and  three prisoners were put to death  that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\n \n\n   \n  The review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona last carried out a death sentence in mid-March,  executing Aaron Brian Gunches  for the 2002 killing of Ted Price.\n \n\n   \n  With Djerf’s execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.\n \n\n   \n  Five more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/business/steinway-piano-factory-trump-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"How a company from the Gilded Age could be the future of US manufacturing","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer based in Astoria, Queens, exemplifies a viable model of U.S. manufacturing by relying on skilled craftsmanship, premium pricing, and domestic sourcing rather than mass production.

October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Oversized crowbars bend wood for a piano’s rim. Circular sanders smooth rough edges on costly Sitka spruce soundboards. Hammers and chisels notch a bridge to allow piano strings to vibrate freely.\n \n\n   \n  For 30 years, Bernard Craddock has been one of the roughly 200 workers handcrafting pianos at the 150-year-old Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, a neighborhood in the New York borough of ﻿Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody has a specific job here,” Craddock said, working on a piano frame. “My job is to set this straight for the hammers to hit the strings.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has vowed to start an American manufacturing renaissance, one of the main aims of his trade war. But manufacturing isn’t easy anywhere in the United States thanks to high costs, strict regulations and lack of workers with the necessary skills.\n \n\n   \n  Steinway & Sons, however, is a rare bright spot in US manufacturing. A company that thrives because it doesn’t mass produce its product. Instead, it uses a small workforce of skilled craftsmen to produce a premium item — world-class pianos.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this storied, legacy brand,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They can charge a premium for that, but they also are serving higher market segments that can afford to pay those premium prices and need to because they’re performing on pianos at the highest levels.”\n \n\n   \n  Most US manufacturers are forced to compete on price, which has become tougher as Trump’s tariffs, especially on key inputs like steel, aluminum and copper, have raised prices.\n \n\n   \n  But by making pianos many consider the best in the world, Steinway can charge high enough prices to keep its US-based operation up and running. A Steinway grand piano can be priced as low as $90,000 or as much as $200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are the largest manufacturer remaining in New York City, we’re very proud of that. It’s not easy to continue to manufacture in New York,” Steinway & Sons CEO Ben Steiner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steiner said his company thrives because it focuses on quality merchandise.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no other way with the cost structure that we have to operate in New York City, or even operating in the United States or in Europe,” he added. “Unless you’re focused on quality and innovation, you’re not going to survive.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s trade agenda could affect jobs\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stated goal of reshoring manufacturing jobs, Trump’s tariffs on most US imports may be  having the opposite effect .\n \n\n   \n  The US shed another  12,000 manufacutring jobs in August , the latest data available, for the fourth month in a row. Roughly 42,000 jobs have been lost since April.\n \n\n   \n  Hersh said Trump’s chaotic trade agenda is acting as a roadblock to factory hiring.\n \n\n   \n  “Businesses don’t like (tariffs), but they can adjust to a reasonable tariff,” Hersh said. “(Trump has) created uncertainty for the economy that just has businesses sitting on their hands, not being able to make decisions about investment or to hire new workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House told CNN that the goal of Trump’s policy is to ensure domestic manufacturers are able to source everything they need in the US, from inputs to workers.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot just be an assembler of foreign-made parts. The Trump administration is taking a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshore every step of the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “There is no shortage of American hands and minds to build America’s next industrial Golden Age.”\n \n\n   \n  But American manufacturing looks very different from five decades ago, when millions of workers were employed to perform specific tasks along assembly lines. After trade agreements flourished in the 1990s, many of those jobs moved abroad.\n \n\n   \n  And in today’s age of automation and artificial intelligence, factory floors are increasingly filled with robots. That means US factories require fewer workers with specialized skills.\n \n\n   \n  Like at Steinway, where making pianos suitable for the world’s best concert halls isn’t a quick process. Building a piano takes Steinway’s skilled craftsmen 11 months from start to finish. On average, workers complete only four or five pianos a day.\n \n\n   \n  And because the piano’s many components are domestically sourced, Steiner said tariffs haven’t impacted them significantly.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s minor impacts in certain materials, but because we manufacture in the United States, it’s not a major issue for us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Maintaining a consistent workforce\n \n\n   \n  While top-of-the-line pricing and domestic sourcing can solve a lot of problems for Steinway, it can’t solve them all.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest challenges facing the piano maker is a potential shortage of Sitka spruce lumber, which Steiner said makes the very best instruments.\n \n\n   \n  “For the Sitka spruce, we find that the best in the world comes from a particular part of Alaska where there’s a very short growing season,” he said. “As a consequence, the trees grow very slowly.”\n \n\n   \n  And Steinway needs to make sure one other component is in good supply: skilled workers.\n \n\n   \n  The factory in Astoria has been in almost continuous operation since 1873, with only temporary pauses in piano production during the Great Depression and World War II. During that time, the company produced glider parts for the war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It not only kept the lights on, so to speak, but it kept some of the valued craftspeople around,” said Anthony Gilroy, Steinway’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications. “The Steinways were smart enough to know that after the war you’d get a lot of people coming back willing to work but without the skills to build pianos, and you needed these old timers, if you will, here in the factory to train the next generation of piano makers.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of the reason Steinway & Sons has never considered relocating out of New York City. It’s those highly specific jobs – performed by “old timers” like 30-year craftsman Craddock in the frame assembly department – why Steinway keeps calling Astoria home.\n \n\n   \n  “The skills that they have, you can’t replicate it. You can’t just open up a factory somewhere else and have those skills,” said Steiner. “So long as our craftspeople are here I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t be, then we’ll still be making our pianos here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/snap-food-stamps-november-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Millions of Americans Are at Risk of Losing Food Stamps Next Month Amid Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the federal government shutdown continues through October 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, will run out of funds in two weeks, threatening to leave millions of low-income Americans without food assistance in November.

   \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roughly 42 million people are at risk of losing critical food assistance in November amid the federal government shutdown. And it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will step in to find the funds to continue paying benefits, as it has with  other priorities .\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program will run out of money in two weeks, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “So you’re talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families, of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Like other members of the Trump administration, Rollins cast blame on the Democrats,  posting on X  Thursday that they are putting “their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued Republicans are at fault for being unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes the extension of  expiring enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Rollins’ comments came a week after the US Department of Agriculture told states that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues. The agency asked states to hold off on November payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n    Debate over contingency funding\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s largest anti-hunger program, SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, but November benefits are expected to total around $8 billion. The USDA’s shutdown plan noted multi-year contingency funding is available to fund benefits in the event of a lapse.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the USDA intends to make at least a partial benefit payment next month, a senior agency official pointed to Rollins’ comments that the program’s funding will be depleted in two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the Trump administration for requiring states to halt the process of issuing monthly benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a deliberate and unprecedented decision intended to inflict pain on millions of hardworking American families — the federal government should instead do everything in its power to prioritize our most vulnerable and make funding available for this critical program,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats over approving a federal spending package for the current fiscal year. The impasse forced the federal government to shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  However, there is not enough of that tariff revenue to also shore up the food stamp program for November, a senior USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The looming lack of funding is already forcing 17 states to stop accepting new food stamp applications. That’s because their systems would require them to send partial October payments with November’s benefits. Other states are able to separate payments for the two months and can distribute October’s aid to new enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n    Critical program\n \n\n   \n  Food stamps provide critical assistance to families who need the help to be able to eat, said Gina Plata-Nino, acting director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group.\n \n\n   \n  The November benefits are especially important with Thanksgiving on the horizon, she said. And food pantries can’t fill the gap since they are already under strain.\n \n\n   \n  The administration should act urgently to protect food stamp benefits, as it has done with its other priorities during the impasse, said Ty Jones Cox, vice president of food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t let households who need help purchasing food become another casualty of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/uk/prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-titles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew Gives Up Royal Titles After String of Scandals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has formally relinquished his royal titles, including Duke of York, after enduring prolonged public and legal scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct linked to Jeffrey Epstein and ties with a Chinese national, Yang Tengbo.

important swing of the bat by a  Mariner  in 30 years happened on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n   Eugenio Suárez  approached the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the score tied at two each. Moments later, he hit just the second grand slam in franchise postseason history to give Seattle a 6-2 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays  and put the Mariners closer to the World Series than they have ever been.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been waiting for games like this my whole career,” said Suárez in an emotional postgame press conference to which he brought his two daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I had it. Today I had it in front of our crowd, in front of my family – my two daughters, my wife. The moment is very special right now.”\n \n\n   \n  After defeating the New York Yankees in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) – a win which many believed  saved baseball in Seattle  – the Mariners came within two wins of the World Series in the resulting Championship Series but ultimately lost out to Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Five years later they were within two victories of the promised land once again, but could not get past the Yankees.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Seattle needs just one more win to erase its unwanted record of being the only active major league franchise never to make it to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  “After Geno’s grand slam, I’m not sure I’ve heard that building any louder than that,” said Mariners manager Dan Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you emotional thinking about that, and just how loud it was in that moment. Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, and they don’t remember a time that it was this loud before.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Blue Jays had tied the series with two alarmingly comfortable wins in Seattle in Games 3 and 4, Suárez got the Mariners on the board with a solo home run to left field in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  A magnificent double play from Cal Raleigh got Seattle out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, but the Blue Jays struck back after Mariners starter Bryce Miller was surprisingly sat down in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  A two-out double from George Springer brought home Addison Barger in the fifth to tie the game, before Ernie Clement’s single drove in Alejando Kirk an inning later.\n \n\n   \n  By the eighth inning, the Mariners were facing the serious possibility of having to win both games in Toronto to take the series. But they found a spark from a familiar source, Raleigh tying the game with a floaty fly ball which hung in the air for 6.7 seconds before just barely clearing the wall in left field.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for about an hour,” smiled Wilson after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh’s homer – his fourth this postseason and his 64th including the regular season – means he is now tied with Aaron Judge in 2022 for the most in a single year in the American League.\n \n\n   \n  It was also Seattle’s first game-tying or go-ahead home run in the eighth inning or later of a playoff game since Bret Boone in Game 4 of the 2001 American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  Having waited 24 years for such a dramatic postseason homer, Seattle fans were treated to another just moments later when Suárez’s heroics gave the Mariners an insurmountable lead.\n \n\n   \n  They now lead the series 3-2 and go back on the road. Game 6 takes place in Toronto on Sunday night.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/dhs-credibility-chicago-immigration-ice","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"In immigration crackdown, DHS statements on arrests face a problem of credibility","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of high-profile immigration enforcement incidents in Chicago and Massachusetts have raised serious credibility concerns about the Department of Homeland Security’s public statements.

DHS’s problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department’s work and its attorneys’ trustworthiness.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of WGN employee\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the  Chicago TV station WGN .\n \n\n   \n  In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she’s obstructing justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said he did not witness Brockman’s interaction with the agents before she was detained.\n \n\n   \n  Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia  McLaughlin said in a post on X  that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin’s version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Car ramming suspect and firearm\n \n\n   \n  DHS’s statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a  post on X  that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A  DHS press release  repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente has disputed the government’s account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez’s vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they’ve been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think anybody who sees what’s going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of Massachusetts teen\n \n\n   \n  A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was  detained by ICE  and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.\n \n\n   \n  The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS official,  posted on X  what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”\n \n\n   \n  Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”\n \n\n   \n  He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.\n \n\n   \n    Judge calls for use of body cameras\n\n \n\n   \n  Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was  initially described by Minneapolis Police  as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.\n \n\n   \n  “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they’re happening frequently.”\n \n\n   \n  The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will  require all agents with body cameras  to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/kim-jong-un-donald-trump-asia-trip","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump officials quietly discussing Kim Jong Un meeting during upcoming Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump administration officials are privately discussing a potential summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump's upcoming Asia trip, though no formal planning or communication has occurred.

meeting during upcoming Asia trip \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately discussed setting up a meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when Trump visits Asia next month, though many are skeptical that it will ultimately happen, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have not yet done any of the serious logistical planning they would need to do to arrange such a visit, the sources said, pointing to the fact that there have not been any communications between Washington and Pyongyang like Trump had at times during his first term. Trump’s initial outreach to the North Korean leader earlier this year never received a reply because the North Koreans would not accept the letter, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the upcoming trip, the White House has instead been far more  focused on arranging a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping  amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting while he’s on his trip to Asia. In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a  handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone  in less than 48 hours after the president  tweeted an invitation  to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s personal interest in a potential sit-down with Kim was  initially piqued after Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung  at the White House in August, the sources said. During their meeting, Lee formally invited Trump to attend the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers in South Korea and suggested the setting could provide Trump with a prime opportunity to meet with Kim, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was open to the idea, telling Lee he would look into it.\n \n\n   \n  “I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump said of the North Korean leader. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Kim also expressed an openness to sitting down with Trump during a speech before the North Korean parliament last month, according to comments carried by North Korean state media.\n \n\n   \n  “Personally, I still have good memories of US President Trump,” Kim said during his speech, per the reports. “If the US drops its hollow obsession with denuclearization and wants to pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea based on the recognition of reality, there is no reason for us not to sit down with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  But things have shifted since Trump met Kim in 2019 at Panmunjom on the border that divides the two Koreas. South Korea played a major part in bringing North Korea back to the table and laying the groundwork for that meeting, in which Trump become the first US president step foot in the isolated and reclusive North.\n \n\n   \n  Ties between the two Koreas were much warmer then. South Korea’s new president has only been in power a few months and has yet to undo the legacy of his predecessor, who was far more hawkish towards Kim’s regime.\n \n\n   \n  According to South Korea’s Unification Ministry, there is no ongoing communication between South and North Korea regarding a possible North Korea-US summit.\n \n\n   \n  And while White House security teams have made two trips to South Korea to scout out locations ahead of Trump’s arrival, none of those trips was to the Panmunjom area, a South Korean government source said, suggesting a repeat of  the 2019 summit with Kim  is not in the cards for now.\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    A hastily arranged handshake\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile summits between Trump and Kim during the president’s first term failed to accomplish the president’s main goal: reining in North Korea’s nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Their meetings in Hanoi and Singapore came after intense prep work between the two sides that focused heavily on logistics and substance. As a result, administration officials and experts believe that if they were to meet again, both sides would have to be making arrangements now.\n \n\n   \n  But not every engagement between the two leaders was built upon the prolonged planning of working-level officials. The last meeting between Trump and Kim in 2019 was arranged hastily after the president tweeted an invitation to get together.\n \n\n   \n  The post abruptly set the wheels into motion for the two to meet at the DMZ – a now famous visit that resulted in Trump briefly stepping over the demarcation line into North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of that invitation, there had not been any active communications between the two sides for months, CNN previously reported. Rather, Trump had departed his last summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi earlier that year without a deal or any signs of progress, signaling the breakdown of diplomatic efforts at the highest level.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to walk,”  Trump said during  a news conference following the conclusion of the Hanoi summit, which broke up earlier than planned. “This was just one of those times.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s 2019 South Korea trip, his former North Korea staffers had considered trying to organize another meeting between the two leaders, but ultimately decided against it because they did not think that the moment was ripe to draw North Korea back to the table, according to former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, however, when Trump began expressing interest in a sit down while he was on the ground in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  The president mentioned a possible meeting when he met with Chinese leader Xi at the time. He asked his then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he thought it would be a good idea, according to a former administration official. Pompeo said he would look into it. To the surprise of many of the members of the team working on the North Korea portfolio, Trump’s tweet went out the next morning.\n \n\n   \n  “After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” Trump tweeted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials immediately went into overdrive as they tried to figure out if Kim would accept. A Korean Central News Agency article came out hours after Trump’s tweet signaling Pyongyang’s openness to the meeting – something the Trump administration closely noted, the former official said. While the article stated that the North Koreans did not know the purpose of the meeting, they did not close the door on the possibility. Administration officials at that point believed a meeting was highly likely, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration then activated the US-North Korea hotline located at the DMZ that is manned 24/7 by a US military officer who speaks Korean. But the calls went unanswered. Then they turned to another tactic that they had used before: a bullhorn. A US military officer went to the border and used the bullhorn to project the message to the North Korean side that the US was trying to communicate with them about a leader-level meeting, the former official said. On the other side, a North Korean recorded the message but did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the hotline rang with an invitation for a US delegation to come to North Korea for a planning meeting. The US delegation, which included the Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, State Department official Kevin Kim and the NSA Senior Director for the Korean Peninsula Allison Hooker, flew from Seoul to the DMZ the same night that Trump’s tweet had been sent, where they met for about an hour with their North Korean counterparts. The two sides discussed the possible meeting but nothing was formally agreed to, and the Trump administration officials left with North Korea’s request for a detailed proposal by midnight. That proposal was faxed to Pyongyang when the officials returned to Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s response did not come overnight, and in the morning, US officials were monitoring every possible channel closely. Then a clear signal came through: the North Koreans had sent an expansive team to clean their side of the space along the Military Demarcation Line that divides North and South Korea, which was highly unusual. Then the hotline rang, and the news came that Kim Jong Un would partake in the meeting with Trump later that day.\n \n\n   \n  As he approached the North Korean leader, Trump took 20 steps into the country, making history as the first sitting US leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom. The two leaders then shook hands and met for about an hour.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/africa/gen-z-topples-madagascars-president-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-04:00","title":"Gen Z protesters toppled Madagascar’s president.

Should other African leaders worry? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week, the military in Madagascar grabbed power as youth-led protests escalated, forcing President Andry Rajoelina to flee.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario was a familiar one for Rajoelina, 51, a former DJ, who was initially brought to power by the military in 2009 after another youth-driven uprising sent his predecessor into exile.\n \n\n   \n  Events in Madagascar reflect a broader trend of similar protests in recent years, impacting countries across Africa, Asia and South America.\n \n\n   \n  Although the protests differ in their specific causes, they share a common characteristic: they are primarily led by Generation Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s), who are voicing their dissatisfaction with their governments.\n \n\n   \n  Technology is also a common feature of the protests, which are organized and mobilized through social media.\n \n\n   \n  In  Nepal , a Gen Z movement fuelled by outrage over a social media ban, government corruption and limited economic opportunities led to the ousting of the prime minister in September.\n \n\n   \n  This followed a similar change in  Bangladesh  in 2024. The Bangladeshi ‘ Gen Z revolution’  involved weeks of intense protests, predominantly led by students, and resulted in the ousting of the nation’s long-serving leader Sheikh Hasina.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, in 2022, youth protesters in  Sri Lanka  also succeeded in toppling the ruling regime.\n \n\n   \n  For Madagascar’s Gen Z, removing their president was a priority. However, while Bangladeshis saw a Nobel Peace Prize winner replace Hasina, Madagascar’s president was replaced by the military – meaning the country’s youth may have to wait for their choice of leader.\n \n\n   \n  Madagascar is now  under the control of Michael Randrianirina , the commander of a powerful army unit that previously supported Rajoelina’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the movement, Elliot Randriamandrato, told news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that “the past few weeks are a half-victory, the real struggle begins now.”\n \n\n   \n  But he believes Rajoelina’s removal was expedited by the military’s involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “People need to understand that one couldn’t have happened without the other,” Randriamandrato told AFP. “Just the military, it wouldn’t have been possible. Just us, it would’ve taken months, even though we were ready for that. The turning point came from the convergence of both.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘African leaders should be wary’\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether what happened in Madagascar will be repeated elsewhere on the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Young people in Africa have been increasingly vocal, calling for major reforms amid growing unrest. The continent has the  world’s youngest population .\n \n\n   \n  In North Africa, young Moroccans have coalesced under the banner of the  “GenZ 212” movement , named after the nation’s international dialling code.\n \n\n   \n  They are critical of the Moroccan government’s priorities, faulting authorities for investments in sports infrastructure which they say overshadow healthcare and education. Recent demonstrations have led to deadly confrontations and  reports of police violence .\n \n\n   \n  In East Africa, Kenya  witnessed protests  stemming from a contentious finance bill that raised taxes during a cost-of-living crisis. These grievances have morphed into calls for regime change, with numerous fatalities reported.\n \n\n   \n  Kingsley Moghalu, a former presidential candidate from Nigeria and a public policy expert, told CNN that these movements signify a growing consciousness among young people of their political power.\n \n\n   \n  Moghalu warns that “underperforming African leaders should be very wary.”\n \n\n   \n  Rajoelina’s removal might rejuvenate protest movements that have lost momentum across the continent, according to Swikani Ncube, a lecturer at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Mass protests in Kenya have not occurred since July. Similarly, a youth uprising in  Mozambique , following a disputed election last year, has been suppressed.\n \n\n   \n  “Where these (protests) had died down, the perceived successes of the youth in Madagascar may serve as a reference point for those who were either losing steam or simply second-guessing their intentions to embark on sustained protests,” Ncube told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Resistance from African Leaders\n \n\n   \n  As youth protests grow stronger, African governments, particularly those that are military-led, are unlikely to surrender their positions without a fight. Even civilian-led administrations have proven survival skills.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, President William Ruto, facing increasing pressure to resign, dared his critics to oust him from office before the next elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell those characters giving us lectures that they can change this administration using violence and unlawful means before 2027, let them try,” he  said in July , in response to violent demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  In neighboring Uganda, protests inspired by demonstrations in Kenya took place last year, organized by young people denouncing government corruption. During these protests, dozens of activists were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  President Yoweri Museveni, 81, has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for nearly four decades. He warned earlier that demonstrators were  “playing with fire.” \n \n\n   \n  Museveni plans to run for a seventh term in office next year, but he faces a potential challenge from  Bobi Wine , the country’s main opposition leader who is 43 years old. Wine has experienced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years.\n \n\n   \n  In Madagascar, Rajoelina has shown no signs of relinquishing power following his removal. Although he’s in exile, he hasn’t formally resigned and calls his ousting a coup.\n \n\n   \n    What’s wrong with governance in Africa?\n \n\n   \n  Africa is no stranger to coups or swift changes in government. Security remains a major challenge, with the Sahel – a region stretching from Senegal to Sudan – accounting for more than half  the terror-related deaths worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, populations have been frustrated by their leaders’ inability to tackle corruption or deliver much-needed jobs and services.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure of governance in Africa is the most important challenge facing the continent, and it’s very deep-rooted,” said Moghalu.\n \n\n   \n  What makes the Gen Z movement so dangerous to African leaders is that the continent is home to some of the world’s poorest countries, and unemployment is rampant, particularly among young people who make up over half of the population.\n \n\n   \n  Although the demands of young people vary across the continent, Moghalu highlighted a common thread: “Their decision to vent their frustration (on issues plaguing the continent) and take action, rather than bottle it up.”\n \n\n   \n  If these challenges persist, youth-led uprisings are likely to become a regular occurrence in Africa, he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “The Gen Z are an impatient and assertive generation. And the rise of technology makes it easier for them to mobilize.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/donald-trump-new-jersey-virginia-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-04:00","title":"Donald Trump is not on the ballot, but he’s a major factor in the November elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Although Donald Trump is not on the ballot in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, both parties are heavily leveraging his influence.

October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump may not be on the ballot in the fall’s biggest political races, but both sides are counting on him to help them win.\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, Republicans are racing to motivate voters who love the president and Democrats are rallying those who don’t, as the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia play out as an early referendum on Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” said Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey, drawing laughs as he takes aim at his Democratic rival, Rep. Mikie Sherrill. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing a fierce fight, Sherrill is quick to invoke Trump in a different way, telling supporters: “That tariff plan? It’s a world-wide extortion scheme so that the Trump family can make billions of dollars. That is not creating opportunity for anyone in New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states in the country that hold gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential campaign. The races could provide an early glimpse at the mood of the electorate, particularly toward the president’s party, but also as a test of enthusiasm as Democrats scramble to rebuild.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is keeping a close eye on both contests, yet Trump has only made a formal endorsement in New Jersey. He is poised to record messages on behalf of Ciattarelli and hold telephone rallies for his campaign, both of which are intended to specifically remind Trump voters about the urgency of the Nov. 4 contest.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re deploying his help in very strategic ways,” said Ciattarelli, who is seeking to walk a careful line of tapping into forces of the MAGA movement, while trying to dampen criticism of being too aligned with Trump. “This race is about New Jersey. It’s not about the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the government shutdown hangs over the race, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. The contest between former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, is seen as less competitive, which is among the reasons that aides to Trump say he has kept more of a distance.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey gains\n \n\n   \n  It’s far from certain how successful attempts to insert Trump into the race will be – or whether they could backfire on Democrats. He made significant gains in both states last fall, but his improvement was particularly notable in New Jersey, where Trump lost by 6 points after a punishing 16-point defeat in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Spanberger, who were among the Democrats elected to Congress in 2018 during the first midterm election of Trump’s presidency, are relying less on arguments of protecting democracy and more on the tangible impacts of Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  When the president said from the Oval Office this week that he “terminated” the Gateway tunnel, a $16 billion commuter rail between New Jersey and New York, as retribution to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, Sherrill seized on the moment. She said New Jersey would lose tens of thousands of jobs and residents would suffer because of Trump’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “We see an out of control president, just at his whim, saying he’s going to cancel it,” Sherrill told reporters Thursday. “We are going to stand up and fight for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than three weeks before the election, the president’s words injected a fresh headache into the race for Ciattarelli and set the table for a real-world test of his embrace of Trump. He said he supported the “a critical infrastructure project,” adding New Jersey needed a new governor who had a good relationship “and when necessary, disagree” with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump effect is on full display in dueling campaign ads, where Sherill repeatedly calls her rival “Jack Ciattarelli, the Trump of Trenton.” Ciattarelli fires back, saying: “New Jersey’s a mess and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also playing out on the debate stage when candidates were asked to grade Trump’s performance. Ciattarelli gave him an “A,” saying: “I think he’s right about everything he’s doing.” Sherrill blasted her opponent and his support of Trump, declaring: “I’d give him an F.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Banking on that voters’ remorse’\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, it’s yet another test of how many Trump voters will cast ballots in elections in which his name is not on the ballot. The outcome could provide important lessons for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress on the line.\n \n\n   \n  With early voting well underway in New Jersey and Virginia, conversations with voters suggest an exhaustion factor with Trump. Yet, for many, it’s unclear whether the president will be a deciding factor in a race driven by economic concerns like affordability and a call for change.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not Trump’s race, it’s Jack’s race,” said Kathy Mueller Rohan, a voter from Morris County, New Jersey, which Trump narrowly carried last fall after losing it by about 4 points in 2020. “I don’t think he needs Trump to win.”\n \n\n   \n  But she believes the president could be helpful, particularly in places where he gained ground. New Jersey is among the states that saw some of the biggest swings toward Republicans in his third presidential election, particularly in non-white communities, which is one of the reasons Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Sherrill-Ciattarelli race.\n \n\n   \n  “Quite frankly we’re concerned Donald Trump won Passaic County in last year’s election, so we have our work cut out for us,” said Mayor Andre Sayegh of Paterson, who supports Sherrill. “We’re being very aggressive in attempting to organize and motivate voters turned off by Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The shift towards Trump in Passaic County, home to a large Hispanic community, is one of many painful snapshots of the last election that has not been forgotten by Democrats. It’s a county that Joe Biden won by more than 16 points in 2020 and Trump won by nearly 3 points in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Sayegh, whose office walls are decorated with pictures of John F. Kennedy, said cultural issues have driven many voters in his area away from the Democratic Party. He believes this election is an opportunity for Democrats to rebuild and, perhaps, rebrand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a year ago – now he’s in!” Sayegh said, reflecting on the first year of Trump’s second term. “People, quite frankly, may have voters’ remorse. We’re banking on that voters’ remorse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/travel/travel-news-nazi-underground-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"Deep underground, the Nazis built a city for thousands of soldiers.

In the 1980s and ‘90s, a subculture known as the Bunker People took over the tunnels, hosting unauthorized and often dangerous events here, from raves to weddings. Today, bats are its inhabitants, some 40,000 of them taking refuge in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  In the 21st century, it’s been given new life as a dark tourism destination, with 19 miles of tunnels open to explore in the Międzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum.

The 180-foot Passage of Commodus takes its name from Emperor Commodus, who you may remember as the conniving meanie portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in “Gladiator.” Experts believe he once survived an  assassination attempt  here. He would later meet his end being strangled by a champion wrestler.\n \n\n   \n  Fans of secret underground complexes will have much to celebrate when The London Tunnels opens in the UK capital, with a speculative date of 2028. This mile-long series of chambers was built to shelter citizens in World War II, before becoming the home of Britain’s Special Operations Executive, an offshoot of MI6 and the real-life inspiration for James Bond’s Q Branch.

Abandoned by its occupants and haunted by the past, it’s now a ghost town, a physical reminder of darker times following the Greco-Turkish war.\n \n\n   \n  Its crumbling buildings swallowed by greenery are starkly beautiful and deeply eerie, even more so as the cooler seasons creep in and sea mists descend. Today’s visitors pay a three-euro fee to wander its uneven lanes and alleyways. Here’s  what CNN discovered  on its visit.\n \n\n   \n   Babylon , in modern Iraq, meanwhile, was the jewel of Mesopotamia and one of the most important cities in antiquity. Today, its ancient ruins are a site in distress, its paths overgrown and facilities scarce. But when the late afternoon sun hangs heavy over Hillah, its steps and statues bathed in heat and light, visitors still feel that they are standing in the footprints of kings.\n \n\n   \n    America’s most haunted\n \n\n   \n  The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia looks like the asylum of nightmares and for many, it was. But it started out as a place of compassion whose massive overcrowding led to desperate measures by doctors and staff. Daily and nightly tours now offer visitors its complex history, along with an occasional paranormal scare.\n \n\n   \n  Many former asylums are now macabre tourist attractions, whose treatment of their subject matter can range from the sensitive to the sensationalist.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/economy/trump-xi-tariff-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The latest chapter of the Trump-Xi ‘situationship’ explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a renewed and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, following a period of truce.

‘situationship’ explained \n       \n  Analysis by Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Another spat between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies has quickly escalated, and if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don’t lower the temperature soon, both nations stand to pay an exorbitant price.\n \n\n   \n  Sky-high tariffs had brought trade between the two countries to a screeching halt earlier this year, before they reached a monthslong truce and substantially lowered levies on one another.\n \n\n   \n  But trade tensions have reignited, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs  starting at 130%  on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the 30% minimum rate currently in effect. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate to all these actions.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump sounded confident he and Xi could resolve matters amicably, telling reporters that he intends to still meet with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who helps lead trade negotiations with China, said Friday that “things have deescalated” recently.\n \n\n   \n  But that was Friday. At any second, the tide could turn.\n \n\n   \n  So, how did we get here?\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s qualms with China\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  Beijing announced  plans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics. Under the new rules set to take effect later this year, five rare-earth elements were added to China’s existing list of seven other highly restricted rare-earth exports.\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, China’s plan calls for mandated licenses for technology needed to mine, smelt and process rare earths, and to make magnets. Foreign governments and businesses would also need licenses to exchange Chinese-sourced rare earths or technology containing them.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Ministry of Commerce said the restrictions aim to prevent materials from “being used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after Beijing announced those measures, Trump took to Truth Social, saying, “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to say that China has “quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position” with rare earths and called the new restrictions “a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.”\n \n\n   \n  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has worked on trade agreements with China alongside Bessent, said last week: “It’s a clear repudiation of everything we’ve been working towards for the last six months, which was a stable tariff situation and a continued flow of rare earths.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s provoked China\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s actions came after a series of moves Washington took that drew the ire of Chinese counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  Among them were  ramped-up restrictions  on worldwide exports to Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, of any parts of products manufactured using American equipment or software.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce called the move announced last month “extremely malicious,” adding that the country would “take necessary measures” to protect the rights and interests of its companies.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration earlier this month also started taxing Chinese ships docked at American ports as well as products transported on Chinese-made ships. Beijing responded with a tit-for-tat fee at its ports.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, meanwhile, up until recently, kept extremely tight restrictions on exports of highly advanced chips, aiming to prevent Beijing from making more advancements in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC could be an opportunity to hash out their differences face to face as opposed to through American and Chinese officials. But things could just as easily devolve, pushing the two nations even further apart.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/gop-rhetoric-no-kings-protests-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the ‘No Kings’ rallies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The GOP, led by Donald Trump and allies, has escalated its rhetoric claiming that the 'No Kings' rallies are filled with antifa, terrorist sympathizers, and terrorists, despite judicial rulings and data showing left-wing violence is not significantly greater than right-wing violence.

And it’s despite  hard data  showing that, even as left-wing violence has increased this year, it still  pales to decades of right-wing violence .\n \n\n   \n  But ahead of the “No Kings” rallies across the country on Saturday, the GOP’s effort has taken a rather stunning turn.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump team and its allies suggested that the rallies, which are likely to draw millions of people, will essentially be chock full of antifa, terrorist sympathizers and even terrorists themselves.\n \n\n   \n  It’s baseless and ugly, yes. But it’s also highly suspect strategically.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP rhetoric surrounding this and the Democratic base more broadly has grown remarkably pitched.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has called them “hate America” rallies and said it’s “all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  A member of his leadership team, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, described the rallies as being held by the “terrorist wing” of the party.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas predicted that “paid protesters” and “agitators” would require calling in the National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the “No Kings” protests were “part of antifa.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted they would feature the “most unhinged in the Democratic Party.”\n \n\n   \n  Others have stepped up their rhetoric about the left in other contexts.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested the fact that protesters might be provided matching signs could  somehow be evidence of antifa funding . (Trump’s own rallies often include people holding matching signs that were handed out, as  comedian Jimmy Kimmel noted .)\n \n\n   \n  And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued perhaps the most extreme comments Thursday on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrat Party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that the kinds of broad brushes being employed here are exactly the kinds of broad brushes Republicans have previously decried.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve spent years assailing Hillary Clinton for putting large numbers of Trump supporters in what she called a “basket of deplorables.” Even less than a year ago, they were seemingly apoplectic about President Joe Biden  arguably calling some Trump supporters “garbage.” \n \n\n   \n  Leavitt herself cast the latter episode as proof that Biden and Kamala Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support” Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The comments also come even as Republicans after Charlie Kirk’s assassination sought to link the coarsening of our rhetoric – things like calling Trump a “fascist” – to political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Does that not also apply to calling wide swaths of the electorate terrorist sympathizers? The administration has now moved from decrying those broad brushes to embracing them.\n \n\n   \n  But even beyond that, it’s a weird strategy.\n \n\n   \n  These aren’t the first “No Kings” rallies, after all. They were also held across the country back in June, and they were overwhelmingly peaceful. The  scenes  were largely full of very normal-looking, liberal Americans speaking their minds.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News this week managed to find  five incidents of violence and/or arrests  from the June rallies – rallies which, again, drew millions.\n \n\n   \n  But two of them were actually  alleged attacks   against  the protesters , with people allegedly targeting them with motor vehicles. In another case in Florida,  2 of 3 people arrested were counter-protesters . A fourth example was a  deadly shooting by a “peacekeeper”  who apparently feared someone was about to carry out a mass shooting. (As of last month, it  wasn’t clear  that either the peacekeeper or the other man would even face charges.)\n \n\n   \n  Anything can happen on Saturday, but the scenes could also provide a rather rapid counterpoint to the alternate reality the GOP is attempting to paint.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic politicians like  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  and  many   others  this week have made a point to emphasize these comments reinforce the need to keep the proceedings peaceful. Some have warned those assembled not to give the administration any scenes that might give it pretexts for Trump’s militarization of the homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Trump is “trying to incite violence as a justification just for more control.”\n \n\n   \n  If anything, the scenes in Portland, Oregon, in recent weeks suggest such messages are being received.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters there have taken to  wearing costumes and otherwise engaging in light-hearted forms of protest . Their efforts appear aimed at betraying the ridiculousness of Trump’s decision to send in the National Guard. A Trump-appointed judge has said the administration’s claims of violence in Portland – which Trump has labeled “war ravaged” – are “ untethered to the facts .”\n \n\n   \n  To this point, Trump’s argument that the left is unusually violent doesn’t appear to have penetrated American public opinion.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  last month showed Americans are about evenly split on whether left-wing violence or right-wing violence was a bigger problem. And a  CBS News-YouGov poll  this month actually showed significantly more Americans called the Republican Party “extreme” (59%) as said the same about the Democratic Party (46%).\n \n\n   \n  The stakes here are huge. To the extent Trump can turn this into reality in Americans’ minds, it opens the door to all kinds of powers he craves. That’s not just when it comes to militarizing US soil, but also wielding heavy-handed tools to crack down on the political left, as he’s made clear he’d very much like to do.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday begins a new phase in this high-stakes moment for our country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/trump-tomahawk-missiles-ukraine-white-house-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-20:15","title":"Trump denies Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, urges both sides to ‘stop the war immediately’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a meeting in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sought Tomahawk cruise missiles from U.S. President Donald Trump to strike Russian energy infrastructure and end the war, but Trump declined to provide them, instead urging both Ukraine and Russia to stop fighting and accept current battle lines.

Tomahawk missiles, urges both sides to ‘stop the war immediately’ \n       \n  By Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:15 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to obtain Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russia from a meeting with Donald Trump on Friday, with the US president later calling for both sides to cease fighting and accept current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had traveled to Washington hoping to receive the long-range cruise missiles, which he believes could deliver a decisive blow to the Kremlin’s war economy by enabling targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, during opening remarks at a White House working lunch, Trump expressed  hopes to resolve the war  “without thinking about Tomahawks,” adding that the weapon is one America “needs.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zelensky appeared to come away empty-handed, describing the meeting as “productive” but declining to comment further on Tomahawks because the US “doesn’t want escalation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, Trump made a public call for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters upon landing in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “And both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing. And that should be it,” he added, saying that he’d communicated that sentiment to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came a day after Trump spoke on the phone with Putin and  agreed to meet him  soon in Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  During that call, Putin is said to have stressed that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield. But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n    Why is Ukraine seeking Tomahawk missiles?\n \n\n   \n  Tomahawk missiles have a significantly longer range than any others in Ukraine’s current armory.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has  tempered discussions  regarding their delivery, he has not definitely ruled it out.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Friday’s White House meeting, Zelensky appeared to suggest a trade of Ukrainian drones for US Tomahawks.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine has thousands of our production drones but we don’t have Tomahawks,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They (US) can have our thousands of drones, that’s where we can work together.”\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky briefed European leaders virtually following his meeting with Trump. The leaders reiterated their “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters, the Ukrainian leader reaffirmed his trust in Trump wanting to finish the war, adding “it was also difficult to manage the situation in the Middle East, and the president was successful in it.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump stopped short of offering a view on whether Ukraine would need to cede territory as part of a peace settlement with Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has taken divergent stances on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his meeting with Putin in August, he said “land swaps” would be necessary for the war to end.\n \n\n   \n  Later, he changed his mind, saying he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory now occupied by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  In comments Friday, Trump did allow for the possibility that Putin may be stringing him along in a bid to gain time to complete his war aims in Ukraine, but concluded: “I think that he wants to make a deal.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/weather/severe-storms-tornado-south-midwest-forecast-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"02:30:00-04:30","title":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes threaten South and Midwest this weekend","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes, and heavy rain are forecast for the South and Midwest this weekend, particularly in northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and parts of Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky.

Midwest this weekend \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Chris Dolce, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:30 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thunderstorms erupting in the South and Midwest to kick off the weekend could turn severe and produce dangerous winds, a few tornadoes and heavy rain.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not been a particularly active fall so far, but the return of severe thunderstorms is a reminder this season, and occasionally  winter , can have a similar clash of the weather ingredients that generate spring’s powerful storms.\n \n\n   \n  Northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma and northern Louisiana up   to Arkansas and parts of the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys have the greatest chance to see severe storms Saturday afternoon into the night.\n \n\n   \n  Strong winds capable of knocking out power and damaging or uprooting trees are the biggest threat, though there’s enough spin in the atmosphere to generate isolated tornadoes that can form quickly with little advance warning. Large hail, from quarter-size to possibly as large as golf balls, could also accompany a few of the storms.\n \n\n   \n  Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Paducah, Kentucky, are some of the cities where people should stay alert for severe weather warnings while tackling weekend plans.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain could also trigger flash flooding in spots, though much of the region is so dry, the downpours are needed.  Moderate to severe drought  covers a large chunk of the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys as well as the Ozarks of southern Missouri and northeast Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n    An unusually warm Gulf is fueling this threat\n \n\n   \n  Fall typically brings to mind cool, crisp air and blue skies, but the United States is seeing unusually warm air stream northward ahead of a cold front in the central part of the country. High temperatures Saturday are predicted to be anywhere from  10 to 20 degrees above average  from Texas to the Ohio Valley, with 80s as far north as Indiana and Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  Columbus, Ohio, could approach its daily record high of 83 degrees Saturday, while San Antonio, Texas, flirts with a daily record of 93 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Storm systems become more energetic in the fall and winter as the jet stream — a narrow band of strong winds high in the atmosphere where commercial planes fly — strengthens and drops south into the US. Storms riding the jet stream can turn severe anytime southerly winds pull up warm, humid air from the Gulf. Gulf waters are unusually warm right now, adding an extra punch of moisture to this weekend’s setup.\n \n\n   \n  The South and, occasionally, lower parts of the Midwest like the Ohio and mid-Mississippi valleys tend to be the regions most affected by severe thunderstorms in fall and winter. In some cases, a major winter storm will dump heavy snow in northern areas, while the South contends with a springlike severe storm threat from the same system.\n \n\n   \n  And with the loss of daylight in those months, there is a greater chance the threat of dangerous storms carries into the evening and overnight hours. Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly than daytime ones, a  2022 study  found.\n \n\n   \n  Colder weather is coming in the weeks and months ahead, but severe storms will no doubt make an appearance at times, so it’s important to stay vigilant and have a preparedness plan in place year-round.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/baseball-los-angeles-dodgers-nlcs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000Z","title":"Shohei Ohtani’s Legendary Night Leads Los Angeles Dodgers to Another World Series, Sweeping Milwaukee in 4 Games","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani delivered a legendary performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers.

\n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s once again Sho-time in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to defend their World Series title in this year’s Fall Classic after a Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, clinching a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. The Dodgers were led by their otherworldly star, Shohei Ohtani, who hit three home runs, struck out 10 batters and got the win for the Dodgers.\n \n\n   \n  It was one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the game, let alone on a stage of this magnitude. Ohtani, the Japanese two-way star who has been breaking boundaries since he joined the league, looked sterling in a six-inning, shutout performance.\n \n\n   \n  And then when he walked to the plate to do something no other player does in Major League Baseball these days – hitting while being a starting pitcher – Ohtani helped himself out. He hit home runs in the first, fourth and seventh innings, with the last one sending his teammates into hysterics.\n \n\n   \n  According to MLB statistician Sarah Langs, Ohtani became the first player in league history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one batter, let alone 10. Per the TNT Sports broadcast, Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit a leadoff home run in the regular season or the playoffs, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.\n \n\n   \n  All of those incredible superlatives come with one other amazing fact, given that starting pitchers usually thrive on a regular five-day schedule for starts: It was the first time Ohtani had pitched in 13 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was, quite obviously, named the NLCS MVP for his performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really fun on both sides of ball today,” Ohtani said via his translator while holding the NLCS MVP trophy. “As a representative, I am taking this trophy and let’s get four more wins.”\n \n\n   \n  Far from the home runs that baseball fans are used to seeing from pitchers, Ohtani’s blasts were absolutely majestic. He led off the game for the Dodgers with a 427-foot blast, hit a gigantic 469-foot homer in the fourth and topped it off with another mega 446-foot blast in the seventh.\n \n\n   \n  “We won it as a team and this is really a team effort so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” Ohtani added.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the fifth time in the last nine seasons that the Dodgers have won the National League pennant, the 26th trip to the World Series in their history.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh my God. I’m still speechless,” Dodger first baseman Freddie Freeman said of his teammate’s performance in an interview with the TNT broadcast after the game.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to check him and make sure he’s not made of steel when he does something like that. Absolutely incredible. The biggest stage and he goes and does something like that. It’ll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani Game.”\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani’s game drew the admiration from another Dodgers star, Clayton Kershaw.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know about Shohei but until you play with him and you see him, it’s just a different level,” said Kershaw, the team’s future hall of famer who is coming out of the bullpen in the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  With the Seattle Mariners taking a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series over the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in the night, the Dodgers will have to wait to find out who their opponent will be in the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  But whoever the American League champion is will be facing a buzzsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers have lost just one game in this postseason and their pitching hasn’t allowed more than one run per game since a loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Divisional Series more than a week ago. Starters Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani make up one of the most formidable playoff rotations in recent memory and their lineup with Ohtani at the top followed by stars like Mookie Betts, Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez and a slew of others.\n \n\n   \n  “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts said to an applauding crowd on hand at Dodger Stadium. “Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  No team has repeated as World Series champions since the New York Yankees dynasty of the last 1990s and early 2000s won three straight titles between 1998 and 2000. The Dodgers are the first team to even make it back to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies did it in the late 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  Kershaw is one of the few players still in the league who was playing when the Phillies made that run. He’s on his last go-round now, retiring after the season and is relishing the opportunity to make history.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to be a part of this team … I’m so happy to be a part of it. This group of guys is awesome, we have a blast and we’re playing so good. It’s just awesome. Whether I get to pitch or not, I’m just glad I get to be a part of it. It’s so fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/alaska-storm-damage-evacuees-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-04:00","title":"Alaska Storm Damage So Bad Many Evacuees Won’t Go Home for at Least 18 Months, Governor Says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful storm, with remnants of Typhoon Halong, inflicted catastrophic damage on remote Alaska villages, particularly in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where up to 90% of homes were destroyed.

In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.\n \n\n   \n  The remnants of Typhoon Halong struck the area with the ferocity of a Category 2 hurricane, Dunleavy said, sending a surge of high surf into the low-lying region.

Additional flights were expected Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are working on figuring out how to move people out of shelters and into short-term accommodations, such as hotels, and then longer-term housing.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the time, space, distance, geography, and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy said. “Agencies are prioritizing rapid repairs … but it is likely that some damaged communities will not be viable to support winter occupancy, in America’s harshest climate in the U.S. Arctic.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\n \n\n   \n  The three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\n \n\n   \n  The storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\n \n\n   \n  Alexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\n \n\n   \n  At least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage officials and business leaders said Friday they were eager to help the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our neighbors in western Alaska have experienced tremendous loss, devastation and grief,” Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said at a meeting of the Anchorage Assembly. “We will do everything we can here in Anchorage to welcome our neighbors and help them through these difficult times.”\n \n\n   \n  State Rep. Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece.\n \n\n   \n  “We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate. She thanked Anchorage for welcoming the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “You are showing my people, my relatives, my constituents, even if they are far from home, this is still Alaska land and they’re amongst families,” Jimmie said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/americas/made-in-guatemala-working-conditions-as-equals-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"01:00:00Z","title":"The truth behind your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals how garment factories in Guatemala—known as maquilas—serve as a critical, yet opaque, link in the global apparel supply chain, producing clothing for major U.S. brands like Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren.

Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Video Journalist: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/trump-maduro-tensions-venezuela-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"Trump and Maduro are both amassing military forces as tensions build in the Caribbean","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the Trump administration intensifies its military and intelligence operations in Venezuela, including deploying B-52 bombers, authorizing CIA covert actions, and launching strikes on drug boats, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responds with large-scale military mobilization, claiming over 8 million militia members and denouncing U.S. efforts as a conspiracy to overthrow his regime.

both amassing military forces as tensions build in the Caribbean \n       \n  By Isabelle Khurshudyan, Zachary Cohen, Ines Capdevila, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President  Donald Trump  weighs military action inside Venezuela, building up forces in the Caribbean and  flying B-52 bombers  off the country’s coast this week,  Nicolás Maduro  is responding in kind, repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia and denouncing US activity in the region – a sign of defiance from the strongman as the two leaders are locked in a standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the  intensifying US pressure campaign  is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump’s first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan  opposition leader Juan Guaidó  as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. But as the Trump team ratchets up the pressure this fall, Maduro has in turn ramped up the rhetoric and propaganda for Venezuelans while calling for new military exercises by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, which has some 123,000 members.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the US military has  moved warships  and other weaponry into the region and has  targeted boats  off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he’d  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training. As of October 17, 20 out of 23 Venezuelan states have been militarized as part of the Maduro’s military mobilizations, called Independence 200.\n \n\n   \n  On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. The recent strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean are a clear message to Maduro, the sources said, noting the administration has been very intentional about linking the Venezuelan leader to trafficking groups and cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. The remarks are Trump’s most expansive comments on his decision to expand the CIA’s authority to conduct lethal targeting and carry out covert action in the region, which  CNN first reported  last week.\n \n\n   \n  In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA’s record of regime change and coups d’état around the world.\n \n\n   \n  “But our people are clear, united, and aware. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We don’t sleep well’\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, daily life has continued despite the looming possibility of armed conflict with the United States. Near downtown Caracas, at the Teresa Carreño Theater, a sold-out musical premiered just days after a well-known salsa party brought together more than 1,000 people in the west of the city.\n \n\n   \n  But Venezuelans are increasingly discussing the US warships in the Caribbean Sea and the fear of a possible US attack. “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña.\n \n\n   \n  Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don’t sleep well.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It’s happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. At the end of September, the government announced that the president had signed a decree of “external commotion,” which he described as “a constitutional defense tool in case the country faces a military aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers.\n \n\n   \n  As Maduro has accused the US administration of trying to steal the country’s oil wealth, the nearby American military presence has drawn closer. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro’s forces carried out drills last month.\n \n\n   \n  At their closest point, the planes flew 132 miles from the Venezuelan mainland, at around 11:20 a.m. local time. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The military has carried out at least six  strikes to date  on six separate boats in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump administration’s war on drugs\n \n\n   \n  The argument that drug traffickers pose an imminent threat to Americans is at the core of the Trump administration’s classified legal justification for carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean — and potentially beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president’s direction.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to  justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups  and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pentagon, some military lawyers, including international law experts within DoD’s Office of General Counsel, have raised concerns about the legality of the lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean,  announced he is retiring  just one year into his tenure.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  Then, on Friday, the US military detained two survivors of its sixth known strike of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. This is the first time an American strike has not immediately killed everyone on board, and the two survivors, CNN has reported, are  currently detained on a US Navy vessel , raising a host of new legal questions to an already murky picture.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/us-ukraine-russia-tomahawk-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00-12:00","title":"Trump meeting brings good news for Zelensky, but Kyiv’s real prize remains out of reach – for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the recent diplomatic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which marks a significant improvement in their relationship.

Even Trump’s final word on the matter, a Truth Social post delivered as he left for Mar-a-Lago, suggested “They should stop where they are” – a ceasefire along current battle lines, suggesting something Kyiv could very much tolerate.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to stop where we are. This is important, to stop where we are, and then to speak,” Zelensky told CNN during a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the day could have gone a lot worse for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  First, Trump extolled the deadly virtues of the Tomahawks, the supply of which he said his meeting with Zelensky was all about. “That is why we are here,” he said. “Tomahawks are very dangerous… It could mean escalation – a lot of bad things could happen.” This is a threat unimaginable when Trump first came to power: the president contentedly signaling he might give the cream of his arsenal to Zelensky so Ukraine can strike deep into Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Yet at the same time, Trump undermined his own threat, by immediately making the nature of the deal before Putin clear. “Hopefully we will be able to get this war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump added. “I think we are pretty close to that.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is, Trump is likely still far from the deal he called “Number 9,” a reference to the number of peace agreements around the world he claims to have had a hand in. But his new approach – of threatening real military escalation, through US technology purchased by European allies and then supplied to Ukraine – might, over time, bring closer the deal he still says Putin wants.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is as psychological as it is military. The US lacks the inventory to provide the “thousands” of Tomahawks Trump said he joked with Putin on Thursday he might give Ukraine. The missiles are normally sea-launched, and so at best Ukraine would have to wait months to receive a few dozen that it would have to adapt to launch on land.\n \n\n   \n  They are remarkably expensive. Their range is not much greater than the drones Ukraine currently fires nightly deep into Russia. If it used them, Kyiv would have to hit targets worth the Tomahawk’s $2 million price tag – which means hitting serious military or government infrastructure, something Trump might veto. Trump and Zelensky appeared to have agreed to leave their arrangements ambiguous: Zelensky declined to offer any details on their Tomahawk conversation, saying the US did not want escalation. Asked if he was optimistic or pessimistic on the missiles, he replied he was “realistic.”\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Trump is now unafraid to admit Putin might be playing him – an important, if overdue, epiphany. He added: “I have been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit with Putin still lacks a concrete date, and appears another moment in which the Kremlin may seek to buy yet more time. But Putin will meet a US president perhaps wiser to his own flaws in dealing with the Kremlin head, and what is required to get Moscow’s attention. Trump has now heeded the advice of European allies: Putin most clearly responds to force.\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump ever makes good on this threat arguably matters less in the changing dynamics of the conflict itself. Zelensky sat before Trump in a position few observers imagined possible in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  As Putin’s much-vaunted summer offensive rattles on into fall, it has singularly failed to capture any eastern town of importance. That may change in the scant remaining weeks ahead of winter in November. But the intense grind, loss and cost of the summer months has still left Pokrovsk, Kupiansk and Kostyantynivka in Ukrainian hands. Kyiv’s grip is precarious, and the Russian advances across open land and through tiny villages leave Ukraine poorly placed for winter. But Kyiv’s key positions, remarkably, for the most part, held.\n \n\n   \n  Given the crises of manpower, resources and morale looming over Ukraine in May, this is startling, and potentially flips the dynamics of the months ahead. Putin has again played his military cards, and not (yet) achieved his goals. In weeks, winter will strip the foliage bare and make it harder for Russian infantry to advance, concealed under the leaves against the threat of Kyiv’s drones.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has again defied expectations, partly due to grit and sacrifice, but also because, as Trump conceded: “They make a very good drone.” These new dynamics may yet change.\n \n\n   \n  But, for the Kremlin, pressure for results is edging towards an uncomfortable need to explain recent failures.\n \n\n   \n  Can Putin afford to fight all winter, through spring, into the fourth summer, to again aim for increasingly minimalist objectives? Gas shortages from Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries, rising inflation, vacillating sign-up payments for new military recruits, and Moscow’s consistent failure to make a real breakthrough, suggest he can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has survived a spring and summer in which Ukraine’s main ally turned on him and tried – without Kyiv - to strike a peace deal with its enemy. Ukraine has seen Europe step financially and militarily into the void left by America, and then seen the same recalcitrant White House offer them its best missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky used to be the global salesman of the case to support Ukraine’s defense and let it become a NATO member. Now he travels around NATO members, pitching to them up-to-date, fast-evolving Ukrainian drone technology.\n \n\n   \n  Recent changes are less comforting for Putin. Yes, China still has his back, but India is surely paying a price from the US secondary sanctions imposed over its purchases of Russian oil. (Trump suggested India had decided to stop buying Russian oil on Friday, which  much reporting  suggests isn’t the case).\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s plan, and support base, depends upon a military win. Putin has yet to achieve that. He may do – remarkably – in the weeks ahead, given late October’s propensity to bring sweeping battlefield change in this war.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the capability of Russia’s closed, autocratic society to suppress dissent, one question is becoming loudest for Putin: “What is your next move?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-04:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan Fires More Prosecutors in Key US Attorney’s Office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lindsey Halligan, a Trump-appointed interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has fired senior prosecutors Beth Yusi and Kristin Bird, citing allegations of unauthorized leaks to the press.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s hand-picked interim US Attorney  Lindsey Halligan  has fired more senior prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia office, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Beth Yusi and Kristin Bird were no longer with the office as of Friday. Yusi has been with the Department of Justice since 2007. One source said that Halligan believed the attorneys to be leaking “unauthorized” information to the press. The other source added that they received termination letters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Yusi and Bird for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan has moved quickly to assert her authority over the office, with several recent firings and departures, and  she has become personally involved in courtroom proceedings — which is unusual for a US attorney —in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James .\n \n\n   \n  The move indicates a deepening split between Halligan, who leads the powerful office, and its roster of experienced prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  The departures mark the latest in a string of resignations and firings in the Eastern District of Virginia in less than a month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier this week that  Maggie Cleary , the senior Justice Department prosecutor who briefly led EDVA, had been removed from the office, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The first Trump-appointed US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia,  Erik Siebert , resigned under pressure from Trump, as resistance in the office built around charging Comey at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Cleary sided with career prosecutors who opposed bringing the Comey case. She sat in a back row, not at the government table, when Halligan presented the indictment from the grand jury before the magistrate judge.\n \n\n   \n  Two other career prosecutors,  Michael Ben’Ary  and Maya Song, were fired in the aftermath of Halligan charging Comey. Comey’s son-in-law  Troy Edwards Jr.,  who was a career prosecutor in the office, also resigned.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department “leadership is more concerned with punishing the President’s perceived enemies than they are with protecting our national security,” Ben’Ary wrote in a note he taped to the door of his former office when he left two weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/china/china-communist-party-expels-military-leaders-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:32:00-04:00","title":"China expels two top generals from Communist Party in anti-corruption crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two top Chinese military leaders, He Weidong and Miao Hua, have been expelled from the Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army over corruption charges, marking one of the most significant purges of senior military officials since the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution.

the military on corruption charges, the country’s defense ministry said on Friday, the most senior officers to be purged in an anti-graft drive that began in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  He Weidong, China’s number two general, and navy admiral Miao Hua, the Chinese military’s former top political officer, are the latest senior military officials to be targeted in a campaign against corruption in the People’s Liberation Army.\n \n\n   \n  He’s removal is the first of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since March, but the investigation of his activities had not previously been disclosed by Chinese authorities.\n \n\n   \n    President Xi ‘cleaning house,’ says analyst\n \n\n   \n  He, Miao and seven other senior military officials named in the announcement “seriously violated Party discipline and are suspected of serious duty-related crimes involving an extremely large amount of money,” defense ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said.\n \n\n   \n  Their offenses were “of a grave nature, with extremely detrimental consequences,” the statement added, calling it a “significant achievement in the Party and military’s anti-corruption campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  The expulsion of He, 68, has implications beyond the military, as he also sat on the 24-member Politburo, the ruling Communist Party’s second-highest echelon of power.\n \n\n   \n  One of two vice-chairmen of the commission, the general is the third-most powerful commander of the People’s Liberation Army and has been considered a close associate of President Xi Jinping, the army’s commander-in-chief.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement came just days before the Communist Party’s Central Committee, an elite body of 200-plus senior officials, is due to hold its Fourth Plenum in Beijing. More personnel decisions, such as the expulsion and replacement of Central Committee members, are expected to be formalized at the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “Xi is cleaning house for sure. The formal removal of He and Miao means he will get to appoint new members of the Central Military Commission - which has been virtually half empty since March - at the Plenum,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\n \n\n   \n  Miao was previously removed from the Central Military Commission in June after being put under investigation for “serious violations of discipline” last November.\n \n\n   \n  The other officials named include He Hongjun, a former senior official at the PLA Political Work Department, Wang Xiubin of the Central Military Commission’s Joint Operations Command Centre, former Eastern Theatre Command commander Lin Xiangyang, and two former political commissars of the PLA Army and Navy. Observers have noted that many of these officials were missing from public view for several months.\n \n\n   \n  Former People’s Armed Police commander Wang Chunning, also named in the statement, was removed from the national legislature last month, along with three other PLA generals.\n \n\n   \n    He and Xi\n \n\n   \n  The purge of He implicates a man with extensive operational experience and long ties to Xi.\n \n\n   \n  His ties to the president go back to their overlapping service in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces in the late 1990s. Xi was deputy party secretary and governor of the province between 1995 and 2002.\n \n\n   \n  He joined the military commission after commanding the PLA’s Eastern Theatre in Fujian province, which faces Taiwan and would be the key region in any conflict over the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, He was promoted directly to vice-chair of the military commission, skipping the usual step of serving on the 205-member Central Committee.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon has said He played a key role in planning live-fire drills around Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the US House of Representatives, angered China by visiting Taipei in August 2022.

But it appeared to mark the first time an attack had not killed everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n  The detention marks the first time that the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners, and it sets up a complicated legal and policy situation for the administration. It is unclear what the US is going to do with the survivors being held, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it continues to promise further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about what happened to the survivors of the strike during an event at the White House Friday, Trump did not address the status of the detainees but said that US forces had “attacked a submarine, and that was a drug carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Just so you understand this was not an innocent group of people,” he said. “I don’t know too many people that have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug carrying loaded up submarine.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who confirmed earlier in the week that he’d  authorized the CIA to conduct covert action  in Venezuela, also had harsh language for Maduro on Friday: “He doesn’t want to fuck around with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat came when Trump was asked about reports that Maduro offered preferential access to the nation’s natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature after the US conducted the series of Caribbean strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region, referred CNN to the White House for comment when asked about Thursday’s strike and the survivors.\n \n\n   \n    Legality of strikes in question\n \n\n   \n  The legality of the Trump administration’s operations in the Caribbean has been widely questioned. Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been both a driver and an architect of the policy – has argued that the US has the right to “wage war” against narco-terrorists. Earlier in the year, the administration designated multiple drug cartels and gangs operating in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The detaining of the alleged drug traffickers who were not killed in the strike this week sets up another legal dilemma for the administration. It’s unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the men, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The Bush administration advanced the theory that it could rely solely on Article II for its military detention authorities, Finucane said — but the Supreme Court never ruled on the matter, leaving the question of its lawfulness unresolved. The Bush administration was ultimately able to rely on a 2001 congressional authorization that deemed the United States to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates to hold military detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The men held by the US Navy could hypothetically petition the courts to rule on the legality of their detention in what’s known as a habeas corpus claim, Finucane noted — a pathway followed by a number of detainees in the past that could reveal more information about the Trump administration’s secretive legal rationale for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/chicago-immigration-crackdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:12:00-05:00","title":"Frenzy of developments cement Chicago as epicenter of immigration crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chicago has emerged as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, following Operation Midway Blitz, which led to over 1,000 arrests in Illinois between September 8 and October 3, 2025.

crackdown \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:12 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with protesters,  Chicago  is being cemented as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of developments in the last 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Now – with the city heading into its first weekend since a fence outside the Broadview immigration enforcement facility has come down, and with the director of   Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s   Chicago field office ordered to appear in court Monday – the stage is set for a reckoning on crowd-control measures.\n \n\n   \n  Several developments on Thursday put the Windy City under the national spotlight, including a federal appeals court upholding a lower court’s ruling temporarily denying the federal government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois and a judge separately  demanding answers  on violent encounters with protesters in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have flared as  federal agents were deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building in Broadview, outside Chicago, has been the site of multiple confrontations as protesters have come out to decry the immigration arrests. Meanwhile,  DHS  has said it “won’t let this violence deter us from arresting the worst of the worst and making Illinois safe again.”\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  A small group of protesters that remained outside the facility Friday evening were ordered by authorities to disperse at 6 p.m. per a  curfew  put in place earlier this month by Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.\n \n\n   \n  It came a day after 13 people were arrested in a federal raid at a Chicago flea market, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday. Those arrested are “illegal aliens with criminal histories including DUI, battery causing bodily harm, and domestic violence,” the department said in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a roundup of what has transpired in the Windy City area ahead of more planned anti-ICE protests on Friday and a  second ‘No Kings’  rally and march planned for Saturday, with more than 75,000 expected to attend.\n \n\n   \n    Federal judge orders use of body cameras\n \n\n   \n  One week after issuing a  sweeping order  trying to quell the intense response of federal agents to protests against immigration enforcement activities in Chicago, US District Judge Sara Ellis told attorneys on both sides of the case to come back to her courtroom to have their own discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she had “serious concerns” about her order being followed and eventually announced she will be expanding her restraining order and will require all federal agents involved in the immigration crackdown in Chicago to have body cameras on when encountering protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but agreed to some flexibility after an attorney representing the Trump administration said it would be logistically impossible to immediately provide all agents with the cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body camera order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic US Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin on Friday called on ICE and Customs and Border Protection to enforce body camera requirements in compliance with the federal order, saying the footage “plays a vital role in promoting responsible law enforcement tactics and verifying DHS accounts against facts on the ground and, ultimately, is in the best interest of agents, officials and individuals involved in use of force incidents.”\n \n\n   \n    Order bars ICE from county property\n \n\n   \n  An  executive order , signed Thursday by the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, prohibits ICE from using county-owned “property, resources, and personnel for civil immigration enforcement activities,” including staging for and debriefing from enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The new order builds on prior resolutions and a 2011 county ordinance that prohibits the use of county facilities and personnel time for ICE investigations without a criminal warrant.\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement and County employees rely on public trust to effectively serve residents. Allowing federal civil immigration operations on County property would erode that trust, discourage cooperation with public safety agencies, and jeopardize the sense of security that all residents deserve,” a  release  from the county about the order said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to ICE for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Federal vehicle moved more than 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  The federal vehicle that American citizen  Marimar Martinez  is accused of ramming earlier this month before she was shot by a CBP agent has been  moved  more than 1,000 miles away to Maine, a Department of Justice attorney said at a Thursday hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney accused the DOJ of moving the vehicle – key evidence in the case – despite knowing he would likely need to examine it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in the case ordered the vehicle be returned via flatbed truck after Martinez’s attorney expressed concern that evidence would not be preserved after it was driven to Maine and back.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, 30, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of assaulting, resisting and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  She is accused of ramming the federal law enforcement vehicle with her car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows it was a federal agent who swerved into Martinez.\n \n\n   \n    ICE arrests police officer\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ICE agents arrested a police officer in the Chicago suburb of Hanover Park, alleging he is an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said the officer, Radule Bojovic, overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Bojovic was “encountered during a targeted enforcement action as part of Operation Midway Blitz,” the department said.\n \n\n   \n  “Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years – what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns? It’s a felony for aliens to even possess a firearm. A law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Hanover Park Police for comment and has attempted to contact Bojovic.\n \n\n   \n    Appeals court denies effort to deploy National Guard troops\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said at the time, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n  The denial is the latest in a court saga over whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority by deploying troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Democratic-led cities like Chicago.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-momentum-gaza-ukraine-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from a recent ceasefire deal in Gaza — which ended a two-year war and secured the release of 20 hostages — to push for similar diplomatic breakthroughs with Russia and China.

We got to get that one done,” Trump said while musing about a new Iran nuclear deal. “If you don’t mind, Steve, let’s focus on Russia first.”\n \n\n   \n  Energized by success in the Middle East, Trump is eager to harness that most elusive ingredient in politics and diplomacy: momentum. A week that began with a 36-hour trip to the Middle East ended with Ukraine’s president in the White House, trying to convince Trump to approve  new long-range missiles  before a surprise meeting soon with  Vladimir Putin in Budapest .\n \n\n   \n  In between, Trump confirmed he’d  authorized the CIA  to operate covertly in Venezuela while threatening to strike inside the country. He threw his endorsement — and a  $20 billion lifeline  from the US Treasury — behind Argentina’s likeminded leader. And he zigzagged through  new China tariff threats  ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping in a few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we carry a lot of momentum, a lot of credibility. Getting Middle East done was very important,” Trump said Friday over lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Cabinet Room. “Nobody thought it could be done. That was one nobody thought could be done, and we got it done.”\n \n\n   \n  “We had to set the table properly,” he added later. “This should be one that we get done, and I think the table is set properly here now, too, and it’ll be a great honor to get it done.”\n \n\n   \n  Translating his ability to quell the Mideast war into successes elsewhere will be a tall order for the president. And there have already been stumbling blocks in the delicate truce with Hamas, including the militant group’s inability this week to produce the remains of  more than a dozen deceased hostages  and subsequent outrage in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The leverage Trump successfully employed on Israel to stop the war doesn’t exist with Russia and China, both nuclear powers who aren’t dependent on the United States for military or financial support. Many senior US and European officials said this week they doubted Trump’s success in the Middle East would lead to any immediate shift in strategy by Moscow or Beijing. And Trump faces political peril with his interventions in Latin America, where US troops and dollars have a mixed history of either propping up or taking down regimes.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile victory\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s experience with Gaza was a reminder that long stretches of arduous, often fruitless effort can eventually result in a victory, however fragile. As the US diplomat George Mitchell liked to say after brokering the Good Friday agreement to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.”\n \n\n   \n  That quote was batted around frequently by aides to President Joe Biden last year as they worked to achieve what Trump eventually did: an agreement to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza while stopping the two-year war. A week after Trump declared the deal done, it appeared to be holding, despite accusations from Israel that Hamas was not maintaining its pledge to return all the hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  American officials were quick to explain it would have been nearly impossible for Hamas to quickly locate and extract the bodies from the piles of rubble and debris left behind from the war. One US adviser pointed out the Palestinian enclave lacks any heavy equipment, like bulldozers, to clear out the wreckage. And they emphasized the unquestionable diplomatic success of getting 20 living hostages released.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the understanding we had with them was we get all the live hostage hostages out, which they did honor that,” one US adviser said.\n \n\n   \n  The task of preventing the deal from falling apart has fallen mainly to Witkoff and  Jared Kushner , Trump’s son-in-law, each of whom helped convince Israel and Hamas, via its Arab interlocutors, to agree. In conversations with Israeli officials, they have tried to emphasize the ways in which they are working to locate all the bodies, including calling in teams from Turkey with experience in earthquake recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  After returning in the middle of the night from the region this week, the president himself spoke again on Thursday with Netanyahu about the issue of the hostages’ remains.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to find out if they behave,” he said afterward, referring to Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Few believe the issue could derail the deal entirely, and American advisers were pushing ahead with the next phase of the arrangement: establishing a multinational security force and taking steps toward rebuilding Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But the issue underscored the fragility of a deal that was pushed through by Trump before many of the details were finalized. Ultimately,  far stickier questions remain , including getting Hamas to disarm, deciding who will govern Gaza and, most crucially, whether the process results in a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n    Carrots and sticks\n \n\n   \n  As he turns quickly to Ukraine, Trump may be drawing some lessons from his Middle East negotiations, including the virtues of working rapidly even as major details remain outstanding. This week he agreed to meet soon with Putin in Hungary in another attempt at face-to-face diplomacy, even as the parameters of a peace deal remain entirely unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Some European officials speaking privately this week said if Trump hopes to strike a similar deal to end the Ukraine war, it will require a degree of pressure on Putin — be it new sanctions or supplying new arms to Ukraine — that he so far seems unwilling to exert. Without sticks, Trump may seek to find carrots to lure Putin into a peace deal, although those, too, will be limited compared to what incentives existed with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, in his dealings with Netanyahu, appeared highly attuned to the Israeli prime minister’s political concerns, be it the demands from his far-right coalition partners or his ongoing corruption trial on long-standing bribery and fraud charges. In a remarkable moment during his speech to the Knesset, Trump called for Israel’s president to grant Netanyahu a pardon, brushing aside the accusations the Israeli leader received lavish gifts in exchange for favors.\n \n\n   \n  “Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?” Trump scoffed.\n \n\n   \n  Finding a political lever to pull with Putin will be more difficult. The Russian president rules as an authoritarian, without the political chores required to keep together fragile coalitions or avoiding legal mires (at least in his own country; he’s wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of trafficking Ukrainian children).\n \n\n   \n  That leaves Trump with fewer options to bring Putin to the negotiating table. For much of the last week, Trump seemed to be warming to the idea of sending Ukraine new long-range Tomahawk missiles, whose 1,000-mile range would put Moscow well within striking distance.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for Washington this week hopeful Trump was serious about providing the weapons, which he believes are necessary for turning around the battlefield momentum. He even arranged meetings with representatives from Raytheon, the US manufacturer of the Tomahawks, to discuss his weaponry needs.\n \n\n   \n  But over the course of his working lunch with Trump, it became evident the Tomahawks would not soon be on their way to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully they won’t need it,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The conversation between the two leaders, alongside their top aides, continued behind closed doors on Friday afternoon in what was described to CNN by several people familiar as a tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the long-range missiles. One official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said afterward he’d agreed with Trump not to discuss the Tomahawks in public. And Trump, as he was flying to Palm Beach for the weekend, wrote on social media that Russia and Ukraine should end the war “where they are,” tacking back to his position from the summer that land concessions were necessary after claiming in September that Ukraine might be able to regain its lost territories.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told those around him that was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one official.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest example of Trump inching closer to allowing new capabilities or applying new sanctions on Moscow, only to back away when Putin intervenes to head it off. In this case, it was a phone call initiated by the Kremlin a day before Zelensky arrived, meant ostensibly to congratulate Trump on his Middle East victory but which resulted in arranging another in-person meeting.\n \n\n   \n    Meetings with Putin and Xi on horizon\n \n\n   \n  If the Budapest summit materializes — Trump said he hoped it would happen in the next two weeks — it would mean back-to-back meetings with two of his top global adversaries who have, in recent years, deepened their alliance. Trump’s face-to-face summit with Xi, scheduled for the end of the month in South Korea, is intended to clarify trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  The war in Ukraine, which Beijing has helped sustain through military supplies and purchases of Russian oil, could be another point of contention. But Trump appeared confident he’d have the whole thing resolved before they sit down.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll be discussing that, but I’d love to see it ended before that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s assessments Friday that Putin “wants to end the war” were reminiscent of his confidence ahead of his August meeting with the Russian leader in Alaska, when he seemed sure the talks would result in quick progress toward a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  They did not, and before Thursday there seemed to be little evidence that Putin was interested in moving ahead with US-brokered negotiations. Trump said he believed threat of Tomahawks could have helped bring him back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  So, too, do American officials believe that a successful negotiation in the Middle East has led Russia to rethink how it is approaching Trump and his desire to see the Ukraine war ended.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump seemed to allow for the possibility that he could be wrong, and that Putin — as he’s feared in the past — may just be stringing him along.\n \n\n   \n  “I am,” he said when asked whether he’s concerned Putin might be playing for time. “But, you know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/acosta-interview-epstein-house-oversight","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s former labor secretary Alex Acosta defends handling of controversial Epstein plea deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney and Labor Secretary, defended the 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, arguing that a federal trial would have been a 'crapshoot' due to unreliable victim testimony, jurisdictional ambiguities, and lack of evidence of cross-state activity.

Epstein plea deal \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:34 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The former US attorney who negotiated a controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein defended that agreement in a closed-door interview with House investigators last month, according to a transcript of the interview released by lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Acosta, the former US attorney from the Southern District of Florida who later served as labor secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, disagreed with the assessment that he gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” and argued that it would have been a “crapshoot” to take the case to federal trial at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta reflected on what he viewed as his constraints as the US attorney on the case and why he felt he did the best he could with the circumstances he was navigating.\n \n\n   \n  The interview was part of the committee’s bipartisan investigation into Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, which has included subpoenas for documents and closed-door testimony. The congressional investigation comes amid growing calls for more transparency over the case.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta  resigned  from the post of Secretary of Labor in 2019 after he faced furor over the plea deal. Epstein avoided a federal trial at the time and  served only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls .  A Miami Herald investigation published  in 2018 described the plea deal, negotiated by Acosta, as the “deal of a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  In his testimony to Congress, Acosta said that a Washington-based attorney from the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section who reviewed the case said going to trial would be a “crapshoot” – a judgement he apparently agreed with.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the trial was a crapshoot, and we just wanted the guy to go to jail,” Acosta told the House Oversight panel.\n \n\n   \n  “If we go to trial and we roll the dice and we do the crapshoot and we lose, what kind of signal does that send? That says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important  to send that signal, and that’s why – that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea,” he later added.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta laid out why he thought the victims’ statements and issues of jurisdiction would have posed challenges to the case if it had gone to trial in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “Every attorney that looked at the case, from the prosecuting attorney, again, through the entire chain, looked at the evidence, and there were evidentiary issues with the victims,” Acosta stated. “Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have – cross-examination would have been withering.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said investigators did not have evidence that Epstein traveled with any victims across state lines, which would have supported a federal charge, or that there were other individuals involved.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, one of the major questions in the case was, is this a Federal case or is it a local case?” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  While Acosta acknowledged that in the political climate today, “there’s a greater desire for ‘just go for it’” among the public,” he claimed that was not the case in the early 2000s when he was making the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Myself, the prosecuting attorney, the managing attorney of the Palm Beach office, the Criminal chief, and the first assistant all favored a pre-trial resolution. It was across-the-board,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta has previously defended his handling of the plea deal, but the release of the closed-door interview transcript offers extensive insight into the former US attorney’s decision-making in the highly scrutinized, and criticized, case.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Acosta stood firm behind his actions, he acknowledged that others have had strong criticisms of his work.\n \n\n   \n  “Looking back in hindsight, there are a number of issues that I will, you know, that I will say caused the community and the victims to feel – to feel that this was not a good resolution, and I get that,” Acosta said. “But from the perspective of our prosecutors at the time, based on the evidence we had at the time, you know, everyone in our office wanted to put him in jail, and that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta placed blame on his state counterparts for allowing Epstein to participate in a work release program that enabled him to be outside of the jail during the business day.\n \n\n   \n  “The work release was granted by the Palm Beach sheriff. Our office opposed it. Our office had every expectation that he would have continuous confinement. We were upset – more than upset. We were – what’s the polite word for ticked off? I’ll say ticked off. We were ticked off that he didn’t do so,” Acosta testified.\n \n\n   \n  “When we found out about it we objected. We objected in writing. We objected fully,” Acosta detailed.\n \n\n   \n    Acosta says it was ‘entirely’ his choice to resign as labor secretary amid Epstein furor\n \n\n   \n  Acosta repeatedly said he did not know if Trump was interviewed as part of his case and said the decision of who was interviewed was not up to him.\n \n\n   \n  “Not to my knowledge,” Acosta said when pressed by investigators. “It would not have been my practice to get involved in who was and who wasn’t interviewed.” He added he had no recollection of ever seeing documents where Trump’s name surfaced during the investigation into Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta said he never spoke to Trump until he was under consideration to be his Labor Secretary. Acosta said there were only two times the Epstein matter could have come up in discussion with Trump or anyone in his administration, but was not certain or specific on the details.\n \n\n   \n  The first was during his vetting process.\n \n\n   \n  “I may have had a communication – I don’t recall if I did or if it was simply – or if there was some written question or otherwise. But at some point in the vetting process, a question may have arisen,” Acosta said. “I honestly don’t remember.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said he had a conversation with Trump’s then- communications team, but did not give an exact date and was vague on specifics. I know in The Washington Post there was a story above the fold at one point,” he said, “And so I talked to the communications team, because the communications team needed to be briefed.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was also asked about rumors that Epstein had ties to the intelligence community., He said during the investigation no one from the intelligence community reached out to the office about Epstein and that he had no reason to believe Epstein was an asset to a foreign or domestic intelligence agency. “If there was any secure information, procedures would have been triggered that were never triggered,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  On his eventual decision to resign in 2019, Acosta said, “I was neither instructed to resign, it wasn’t suggested that I resign. It was entirely my choice, my decision.”\n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Acosta was shown at least two news articles that connected Trump to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  One was a New York Magazine  article  from 2002 prior to Acosta’s term as US attorney, where Trump is quoted saying he knows Epstein for 15 years and calls him a “terrific guy.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump is quoted saying the 2002 article.\n \n\n   \n  The second article Acosta was shown was from  October 2007 - - after Acosta’s office had executed the non-prosecution agreement but before Epstein had plead guilty—that alleged Epstein would try and “procure girls” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and was banned as a result.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was then asked if he is aware if Trump was interviewed about women at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not aware of who was interviewed and not interviewed in the case generally because U.S. attorneys do not become involved in deciding who gets interviewed and who does not get interviewed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/business/salesforce-marc-benioff-apology","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:39:00Z","title":"Marc Benioff apologizes for suggesting National Guard be sent to San Francisco","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, initially suggested that President Donald Trump send the National Guard to San Francisco to address safety concerns, a statement that drew immediate backlash from both the public and within his own circle.

President Nicolas Maduro spilled into public view during a White House meeting with Ukraine’s leader Friday, which saw Trump trade  military strikes  in the Caribbean for an f-bomb in the Cabinet Room.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on reporting from  The New York Times  that Venezuela had approached administration officials with a proposal to offer preferential access to its natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature between the two nations, Trump told reporters Maduro has “offered everything.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue language at the White House is rare, but it’s not the first time Trump has deployed that specific expletive to vent his annoyance over diplomatic challenges\n \n\n   \n  In June, following the news Israel and Iran violated a temporary ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long, and so hard, that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shrugged off many norms as president, and often used coarse or politically incorrect language, both as president and as a presidential candidate — in 2018,  he decried immigrants coming to the US from what he called “shithole countries ,” behind closed doors, later using the same curse to describe the District of Columbia  during a 2024 campaign rally in Iowa .\n \n\n   \n  But he’s hardly the first prominent politician to deploy the f-word or other expletives from their off-color arsenal in public.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, raised eyebrows when, during a 2010 press conference with then-President Barack Obama, he was caught telling Obama passage of the Affordable Care Act was a “big fucking deal.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats  later used the gaffe to raise money for the Democratic National Committee .\n \n\n   \n  Later, as president, Biden  was again caught on a hot mic  calling a reporter in the White House press pool “a stupid son of a bitch,” for asking a question he didn’t like, though he later called the reporter to apologize.\n \n\n   \n  Obama too raised eyebrows when, during an off-the-record portion of a 2009 interview with CNBC, he called rapper Kanye West “a jackass” after West rushed the MTV stage during Taylor Swift’s speech accepting the award for best female music video of the year.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2004, then-Vice President Dick Cheney  told Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy to “go fuck yourself”  on the Senate floor during Senate picture day after Leahy accused the vice president of war profiteering.\n \n\n   \n  Using profanity on the Senate floor is against the chamber’s rules, but Cheney skirted a violation because the Senate was not in session, a Senate official told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/venezuela-trump-saber-rattling","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:32:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Politically Dicey Saber-Rattling in Venezuela","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is engaging in aggressive, politically risky foreign policy actions toward Venezuela, including military buildups by the U.S. Navy and Air Force, and authorizing covert CIA operations targeting drug trafficking and possibly regime change.

So much of it is unpopular and politically fraught. They’re charging ahead regardless.\n \n\n   \n  That’s true of the tariffs. It’s true of the growing militarization of the homeland. And it’s been true of his cuts to the government and  many other things .\n \n\n   \n  But perhaps nothing is as politically fraught right now as what’s happening off the coast of South America.\n \n\n   \n  There are growing signs that Trump is  flirting with regime change or even attacking Venezuela . And to the extent it’s more than a bluff, it’s not difficult to see the situation blowing up in the administration’s face.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf today runs through the increased saber-rattling and  signs of a building clash . The US Navy has built up in the Caribbean, and the Air Force flew B-52 bombers off the Venezuelan coast for hours on Wednesday. The Trump administration is striking alleged drug boats  in quite possibly illegal ways . Trump has both left open the possibility of strikes inside Venezuela and confirmed Wednesday that he has  authorized covert CIA action there .\n \n\n   \n  We also learned Thursday that the admiral overseeing this US Southern Command region, Adm. Alvin Holsey, has  suddenly announced his retirement . CNN reports this came amid tensions over the administration’s activities, though the Pentagon denied this.\n \n\n   \n  There are a couple ways to read all this.\n \n\n   \n  One is that this is part of a trademark Trump pressure campaign to get Venezuela to bend to his will. Perhaps the threat will be enough to get Trump what he wants.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a different side of Trump in his second term –  an increasingly militaristic one . He seems to have shed the non-interventionist political veneer that characterized his campaigns for office in favor of a more heavy-handed approach on the world stage. And that would fit with his broader project, which appears to be largely about showing how powerful he can be.\n \n\n   \n  And even if his saber-rattling is all intended as a bluff, at some point it’s conceivable that the president could be forced to follow through.\n \n\n   \n  If it comes to that, it’s difficult to see how Trump would have the American people behind him.\n \n\n   \n  While we don’t have good quality polling on the Venezuela situation specifically, other recent surveys have shown Americans taking a dim view of such foreign adventurism.\n \n\n   \n  A  poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  last year showed the percentage of Americans who favored an active role in world affairs hitting its lowest point since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Just 17% of Americans agreed that the US had a “responsibility” to take a leading role in world affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed Americans agreed 58%-38% that it’s better if the US “stays out of the affairs of other nations.” Majorities of Republicans, independents and Democrats agreed with that sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  Americans have been willing to take active roles in certain foreign conflicts. But that quickly changes when it includes the prospect of conflict involving US troops and regime change, according to several surveys taken around the time of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Iran is, of course, not Venezuela. You could certainly argue that going to war with Iran would be a far riskier proposition.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s a threat that Americans have been quite concerned about for years and decades. But there is no evidence that Americans feel similarly about Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the case that Venezuela has sent drugs and gangs to invade the United States, but so many of these claims have proven hyperbolic – and  even been rejected by judges  and  his own intelligence community .\n \n\n   \n  It’s conceivable that Americans could be convinced that going into Venezuela is necessary to combat the flow of drugs. A 2023  Reuters poll , for instance, showed Americans supported sending the US military to Mexico to “fight against drug cartels and try to reduce the flow of illegal narcotics,” 52%-36%.\n \n\n   \n  But even that poll showed how wary Americans are of a wider war. When asked whether the US should do this unilaterally – in other words without the permission of the Mexican government – support plummeted. Americans opposed that about 2-to-1 – 59%-29%.\n \n\n   \n  That’s essentially the proposition in Venezuela, with a little potential regime change sprinkled on top.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump really goes there, it will show he’s truly thrown political caution to the wind.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/supreme-court-national-guard-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00-04:00","title":"Trump asks Supreme Court to OK National Guard deployment in Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to authorize the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, claiming that federal officials face imminent threats from a pre-planned, multi-attacker ambush.

On Thursday, the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an order temporarily blocking that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Trump filed the appeal at the Supreme Court in a case involving his effort to deploy the guard to Chicago. In the appeal, the administration said that lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The litigation puts the controversy before a Supreme Court that has rarely ruled on such deployments – but that has often deferred to the president on matters of security and defining what  constitutes a national emergency . The administration asked for a quick order that would allow them to carry out the deployment while the high court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  In the appeal, the Trump administration argues lower courts were impermissibly encroaching on the president’s authority to control federalized guard members.\n \n\n   \n  The   lower court order temporarily blocking the deployment, the administration said, put the judicial branch “in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the president’s commander-in-chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the president can deploy.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting that federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law-enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.\n \n\n   \n  That framing starts in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as a “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court balked at Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In the administration’s appeal on Friday, Sauer said that case “squarely controls” Trump’s current deployments.\n \n\n   \n   Based on that, the Trump administration has argued, federal courts may not even review a president’s decisions to call up the guard.\n \n\n   \n  But the states challenging those decisions have scoffed at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army. And they have pointed to a 1932 decision, Sterling v. Constantin, in which courts reviewed a former Texas governor’s decision to deploy the National Guard to shut down certain oil fields in the state in order to limit production. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could review such deployment decisions that fell beyond a “range of honest judgment.”\n \n\n   \n  Just how fast the Supreme Court will move in the case was not immediately clear, but the court requested a response from state and local officials by Monday evening – a faster than usual turnaround.\n \n\n   \n  The 6-3 conservative court has sided with Trump in the vast majority of emergency cases he has filed since returning to power in January.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/media/smartmatic-doj-fox-giuliani-bribery-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Smartmatic Indicted in Foreign Bribery Case, Possibly Endangering Its Lawsuits Against Fox News and Giuliani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department filed foreign bribery charges against Smartmatic, alleging a $1 million bribe paid to a top Philippine election official in 2016 to secure contracts, though no allegations of election fraud are involved.

executives, including its founder.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment relates to an alleged $1 million bribe paid to the top election official in the Philippines to secure lucrative contracts for that country’s 2016 elections. The indictment doesn’t include any allegations of voter fraud or election-rigging against Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  The news could be catastrophic for Smartmatic, potentially weakening its hand in pending 2020 election-related defamation lawsuits against Fox News, the Fox News host turned US attorney  Jeanine Pirro , ex-Trump lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  and MyPillow CEO  Mike Lindell .\n \n\n   \n  The charges could undermine Smartmatic’s arguments that its reputation has been damaged solely by these pro-Trump figures and their brazen lies about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more of the same. A photocopy of the previous spurious indictment,” Smartmatic said in a statement on Thursday, denying wrongdoing and vowing to fight the case.\n \n\n   \n  The company further said, “We believe the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has been misled and politically influenced by powerful interests, despite our extensive cooperation with the government. This is again, targeted, political, and unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what meddling Smartmatic is referring to. President Donald Trump has successfully pushed in recent weeks to  prosecute his opponents , but the underlying case against Smartmatic executives was brought by the Biden-era Justice Department, and career prosecutors endorsed Thursday’s new indictment, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic’s co-defendants previously pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s machines and software are widely used overseas, but in US elections, they are only used in Los Angeles. Dean Logan, the top election official for Los Angeles County, told CNN in a statement that the county owns and controls its own voting systems, but will “hold Smartmatic accountable to the terms and protections” of their ongoing contract.\n \n\n   \n  “The indictment is unrelated to the County’s administration of elections or the integrity of Los Angeles County’s voting systems, and the County’s contracts with Smartmatic were validated to ensure that all work was performed and requirements met,” Logan said. “Further, the County’s engagements with Smartmatic are fixed fee contracts with specific protection from the types of add-on fees and price inflation alleged in the activities cited in the indictment.”\n \n\n   \n    The defamation cases\n \n\n   \n  After President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies  spread the false claim  that Smartmatic technology flipped millions of votes to rob him of a victory.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic filed defamation lawsuits in 2021 against these figures, and other right-wing media outlets, seeking billions of dollars in damages. The company  settled with Newsmax  last year for $40 million and  settled with One America News  for an undisclosed amount.\n \n\n   \n  All of these pro-Trump outlets and figures deny wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines scandal — which  CNN first revealed  in 2023 — has  provided a major boost  to these pro-Trump figures facing defamation lawsuits. They have sought additional documents about the criminal probe, hoping these will weaken damages claims from Smartmatic, and they’ve argued that the indictment proves Smartmatic’s shady practices.\n \n\n   \n  “Smartmatic was and is a failing company: its continued cozy relationship with dictators, a decade of mismanagement and poor performance, and criminal bribery charges against its highest echelon of leaders,” Fox News wrote in a court filing earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Kate Mangels, a Los Angeles-based defense attorney who has handled defamation cases, said the indictment “severely limits” Smartmatic’s ability to claim it’s still suffering from ongoing damages from the 2020-era lies about its supposed vote-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendants in the defamation lawsuits will likely argue that, to the extent Smartmatic’s reputation has been harmed, it is impossible to tease out what harm came from the alleged defamation and what harm came from the indictment,” Mangels said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment could also influence settlement negotiations, Mangels said, because “at trial, it would be difficult for Smartmatic to establish that all the damages” stem from the allegedly defamatory broadcasts and statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/deadly-michigan-plane-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00Z","title":"Deadly plane crash in Michigan mirrors similar business jet crash last year","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered in Mexico and operated by Duncan Aviation, crashed near Lansing, Michigan, during a post-maintenance test flight on October 17, 2025.

Ozempic? Oz cautions it’s not a done deal, but patients and doctors say it could be a gamechanger \n       \n  By Meg Tirrell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Janet McCaskill was on vacation in Arizona with her husband and best friend when she heard that President Donald Trump had suggested he might be able to bring the cost of popular weight-loss drugs down to $150 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “The thought of it going to $150 a month is dramatic,” said McCaskill, a grandmother from North Carolina  who’s lost 100 pounds  with the help of GLP-1 medicines, a class best known for the diabetes drug Ozempic. “That is most fantastic – if it comes to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump planted the idea Thursday in an Oval Office news conference about an entirely different set of drugs – those for  in vitro fertilization  – before his Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz, stepped in to warn it wasn’t a done deal.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump’s comments made waves. Patients who’ve struggled to afford the pricey medicines shared hope the price could be reached. Doctors called it “huge for patients,” if true. And in a sign that Wall Street took it seriously, stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of GLP-1 drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, fell significantly, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in the companies’ market values.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just not clear it’ll actually happen.\n \n\n   \n    An awkward moment in the Oval\n \n\n   \n  It started with a familiar refrain from the president,  who’s previously lamented  the cost difference of weight-loss drugs in Europe compared with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “In London, you’d buy a certain drug for $130 … and in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,” Trump said in opening remarks of his IVF announcement Thursday. “So now we’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150.”\n \n\n   \n  A reporter, Max Bayer of Endpoints News, made the connection, asking later if Trump was referring to bringing weight-loss drugs down to $150. The president confirmed he was “referring to Ozempic, or the fat-loss drug … they’ll be much lower.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Dr. Oz started to look uncomfortable, stepping up to the podium with a subtle shaking of his head.\n \n\n   \n  “We have not negotiated those yet,” Oz clarified. “We’re going to be rolling these out over time.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly’s stocks to react, each dropping about 4% in after hours trading Thursday and maintaining losses through trading on Friday. A Wall Street analyst, Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets, sought to assuage investor fears of coming price cuts in a research note Thursday evening that called Trump’s remarks “aggressive posturing amidst negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The drug companies were tight-lipped. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and its weight-loss counterpart, Wegovy, told CNN that the company “has engaged in discussions” with the Trump administration about drug pricing in the context of the president’s Most Favored Nation executive order, an approach that dictates the US shouldn’t pay more for medicines than the lowest price offered to peer nations.\n \n\n   \n  Medicines are routinely sold at markedly higher prices in the US than other countries, including diabetes and weight-loss drugs: Ozempic is priced 10 times higher in the US than France, according to  a 2023 analysis  from Peterson-KFF.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain focused on improving patient access and affordability, and we will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need,” a Novo Nordisk spokeswoman said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, said the company is “not aware of any specific price commitments,” and that it’s “in discussions with the administration to further expand patient access, preserve innovation and promote affordability for our medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Most Favored Nation’ drug prices\n \n\n   \n  The president has announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and  EMD Serono  in the past month under the Most Favored Nation framework, and has promised more to come. The deals so far have included an offering of medicines at Most Favored Nation prices to Medicaid – a system that already receives heavy discounts – as well as deals on certain drugs that can be purchased directly by consumers, without insurance, through a new platform called TrumpRx.\n \n\n   \n  In return, drugmakers have won reprieves from the threat of tariffs, as long as they continue to invest in manufacturing and research in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Thus far, the deals have appeared neutral or positive to pharmaceutical companies, with  Pfizer’s stock rising  the day of its announcement and buoying competitors along with it. The agreements, Seigerman wrote, “have been far from a sweeping implementation of US pricing cuts.”\n \n\n   \n  The drugs Pfizer and the White House noted  would be offered  through the TrumpRx program don’t appear to be used very often in the US, face generic competition in the near future, or carry such high list prices that even steep discounts for cash-paying patients would leave the medicines unaffordable for most people, said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 medications, though, so-called for a hormone they mimic, are used by millions of Americans, and “if you look at the barriers to using them, cost is the number one thing,” said  Dr. Louis Aronne , director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n \n\n   \n    From thousands to hundreds\n \n\n   \n  The medicines are all priced, before insurance or discounts, at about $1,000 a month or more in the US. With commercial insurance coverage, many patients pay as little as $25 out of pocket. But coverage can be thorny, especially for weight loss, and some insurers are  reducing coverage .\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill experienced that firsthand. She started using Mounjaro in late 2022 to try to lose weight, and had such strong results, she credits the medicine with saving her life. But her insurance didn’t cover it, and it was so expensive she switched to a compounded version made by a local pharmacy.\n \n\n   \n  Compounders typically make drugs that require personalization, like if a patient is allergic to a certain ingredient or needs other modifications made. But law also allows compounding when medicines are in shortage, and GLP-1 manufacturers had trouble meeting outsized demand for several years, opening up an entire market of off-brand, compounded GLP-1s.\n \n\n   \n  Though the shortages  have now ended , some purveyors still offer compounded versions of the medicines, at much lower prices than Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly – even after  the companies introduced  cash pay discounted options.\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill said she switched to a Lilly program that allowed her to buy its weight-loss drug, Zepbound,  directly at at discount  after her local compounding pharmacy stopped selling the medication. But it costs her about $500 a month. Her best friend, Kay Powell, a nurse, is also on one of the medicines, but gets a compounded version through another pharmacy she trusts for $150.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m moving back to the compound just as soon as I can get to my doctor next week,” McCaskill told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re price shopping,” Powell added. “We’re going to buy it wherever it’s most affordable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big however’\n \n\n   \n  The White House and US Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from CNN about Trump’s $150 promise from the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  And doctors, analysts and policy researchers were skeptical they’d reach a $150 deal – or even what that might mean.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments may be “more to get these guys to make a deal than to actually get the price to $150 over the short term,” said Jared Holz, a health care strategist for financial firm Mizuho Securities USA. “Everything that comes out of this administration seems like it’s a precursor to some sort of transaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. William Feldman, a physician and health policy researcher at UCLA, pointed out Novo Nordisk is  also in negotiations  with Oz’s CMS over pricing of semaglutide – the generic name of Ozempic and Wegovy – for Medicare, under a framework laid out in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. He noted it’s not clear if a $150 monthly price would be part of those negotiations or a broader agreement outside them.\n \n\n   \n  “$150 a month gets closer to prices for semaglutide in other parts of the world and even to prices for compounded versions in the US,” he told CNN by email Friday. “This could be a boon for patients and could drive increased uptake in the US. However – and this is a big however – I’d like to see more details.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jody Dushay, an attending physician in endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said she refers patients to both Lilly and Novo Nordisk for their self-pay options when they don’t have insurance coverage, but pointed out “for many patients $500 a month is still totally unaffordable.”\n \n\n   \n  She urges patients to steer clear of compounded products, though, “due to lack of regulation and unknown safety and efficacy.”\n \n\n   \n  If the branded versions were priced at $150 a month,  access “would greatly increase,” said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an obesity specialist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. “Even more patients would be willing and able to afford paying” for them.\n \n\n   \n  Even an out-of-pocket cost “would still pose some financial barriers,” said Dr. David Kim, an assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences at the University of Chicago. Vanderbilt’s Dusetzina pointed out “prior research has shown that once the prices reach $100 per month, many people do not fill their medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    260 pounds all together\n \n\n   \n  Affording GLP-1 medicines can make people feel desperate at their current prices and without insurance coverage, McCaskill said, especially as she’s seen not just dramatic weight loss but improvements in her cholesterol and other health markers.\n \n\n   \n  “Between the three of us, we’ve probably lost – what – 260 pounds?” Powell added, including McCaskill’s husband, Barry, in the tally.\n \n\n   \n  They all said they’d switch to the branded versions, away from the compounded ones, if they were offered at comparable prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the real thing,” Barry said. “No question.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misspelled Bayer’s last name.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/des-moines-superintendent-ian-roberts-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00-05:00","title":"Iowa Superintendent Detained by ICE Falsely Claimed He Was a US Citizen, Indictment Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ian Roberts, the former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for possessing firearms while an illegal alien.

Soon after, New York Attorney General Letitia James was charged with bank fraud related to a mortgage  in an indictment unveiled  last week. But while Trump called in his post specifically for the prosecutions of Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, he never mentioned Bolton in his missive.\n \n\n   \n  The cases against Comey and James were presented to a grand jury by Lindsey Halligan, an interim US attorney handpicked by Trump for the position after the previous US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was forced out amid pressure to bring the cases.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer who had no previous prosecutorial experience, was the only prosecutor to sign both indictments.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, six prosecutors, including US Attorney for Maryland Kelly Hayes and the current head of counterintelligence investigations at the Justice Department, Scott Lara, signed the 26-page indictment against Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  In it, prosecutors accused Bolton of sharing “more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities” through his personal email account with two unauthorized individuals, who CNN has reported are his wife and daughter.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against Comey and James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said. That hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly attacking Bolton and possibly causing damage to the case, some Justice officials fear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has railed for years against Bolton over his 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president, claiming he should have gone to jail because classified information was contained in the book. Trump’s first Justice Department opened criminal and civil investigations into the book in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said Thursday when told Bolton had been indicted, adding that he had not reviewed the case.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton made his initial court appearance in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Friday morning, pleading not guilty to all 18 counts. He said in a statement Thursday that he was a victim of Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” Bolton said. “I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good luck, Mr. Mustache!’\n \n\n   \n  In June 2021, the Justice Department  closed its year-old criminal investigation  that scrutinized whether Bolton’s 2020 book had illegally revealed national security information.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, an Iranian hack of Bolton’s AOL email account would set in motion a new probe that led to Thursday’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  On July 6, 2021, a Bolton representative notified the FBI that he was the victim of an email breach by suspected Iranian hackers.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have been laboring on this case since then after the FBI began assessing potential damage from the hack and raised questions about whether Bolton’s practice of sending diary entries from his personal email broke the law, according to people briefed on the probe.\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian hacking campaign targeting Bolton and other former government officials included threats against Bolton to expose him and cause him problems of the kind that crippled Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  “Good luck Mr. Mustache!” one message sent in August 2021 said, according to a person who described investigative documents.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI and national security lawyers in Maryland, and at Justice Department headquarters, formally opened an investigation into the hack in 2022, sources said. Early in the probe, prosecutors on the investigation got warrants to receive the data from service companies that hosted relevant accounts, such as Yahoo for Bolton’s AOL account and Google for another account, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The work building a case was slow and meticulous. Information returned to the prosecutors needed to be reviewed by both the intelligence community, which was sensitive to classified information, and processed through a filter team at the Justice Department that would pull out confidential attorney-client records, because Bolton was a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the work around what Bolton had and shared in his email account was an investigation essentially walled off from the one related to his book, which had been run by the US Attorney’s office in the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  By the time investigators were ready to obtain a search warrant in August, the book manuscript had once again become part of the case. It was part – along with the hack – of what prosecutors pointed to in court as a basis for searching his office and home, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to search Bolton’s office and especially his home were crucial in the final turn of the investigation before the indictment this week.\n \n\n   \n  While investigators spent months assembling an idea of the emails and classified records they would want to use to build the case, Bolton’s home contained printed copies of some of the emails, the indictment said. Investigators had long suspected they would find hard copies like those, sources told CNN, because some of the emails Bolton wrote to his family he noted were for “the Archives.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s really treasonous’\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly attacked Bolton since the release of his 2020 book and as Bolton has become one of the more prominent ex-Trump staffers turned critic of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton was named Trump’s third national security adviser in 2018, a position that marked the culmination of a lengthy career in Washington across multiple administrations, including as George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  The initial Justice Department criminal probe of Bolton began in 2020 with an investigation into whether his he violated the law by including information the administration said was classified in his memoir. The same year, the Trump administration sued in civil court to try to stop publication of Bolton’s book over a dispute of whether he got proper sign off from classification authorities.\n \n\n   \n   Bolton’s memoir  included shocking allegations about the inner workings of the Trump White House, including that Trump requested Chinese help to win the 2020 election, argued Venezuela was part of the US and offered to help Turkey’s leader avoid a Justice Department probe.\n \n\n   \n  Trump publicly called for Bolton to be prosecuted in 2020 over the book’s publication, saying in  an interview  that his former national security advisor released “massive amounts” of classified information in its pages.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really treasonous what he did,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  On X, then called  Twitter , Trump called Bolton “a lowlife who should be in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Trump hasn’t frequently commented this year on the Bolton probe – a stark contrast from his public pressure campaigns for the prosecutions of other political foes who were key figures in investigations into himself.\n \n\n   \n  But since the search of Bolton’s house and office in August, Trump has asked advisers about the status of the case. He had been assured in recent weeks that they were moving ahead and that it was a strong case, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Stay tuned’\n \n\n   \n  In late August, when FBI agents executed a search warrants on Bolton’s home and office, they  seized electronics and multiple documents  labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, according to court records filed by prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi, Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino all posted statements on X the morning of the search,  breaking department norms  of not commenting on ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “Public corruption will not be tolerated,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino  wrote .\n \n\n   \n  After the search, Bolton’s attorney Abbe Lowell said that the records Bolton kept would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official. In a statement Thursday, Lowell said that the records were unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, were known to the FBI and were “personal diaries.”\n \n\n   \n  The next month, senior Justice Department leaders, including an attorney from the deputy attorney general’s office, were  pressing for the US Attorney’s office  to charge Bolton in the days after Trump complained that prosecutions of his enemies weren’t moving quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors in the Maryland US attorney’s office pushed back, arguing the timeline was too aggressive and they needed more time to bring a stronger case against Bolton, including reviewing the records obtained from the search warrant.\n \n\n   \n  One Justice Department official was considering pulling prosecutors off the case out of opposition to the deputy attorney general’s instruction.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, though, the political pressure eased on the Maryland office after Comey’s indictment. Career prosecutors on the case withdrew their reservations on timing and set in motion  finalizing the indictment  last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the lead prosecutor in Bolton’s case, Thomas Sullivan – who also worked on the Biden classified documents investigation under special counsel Robert Hur – presented to a federal grand jury for a little over two hours at the federal courthouse about 20 minutes outside DC.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen minutes after members of the grand jury filed out of the courthouse, Sullivan, four of his colleagues and the jury foreperson took an elevator one floor up to Magistrate Judge Gina Simms’ courtroom to deliver the indictments approved that day. After the foreperson handed up the indictments, the judge asked if there were any other matters she needed addressed, to which Sullivan said yes.\n \n\n   \n  He handed the judge a slim red file, but and said nothing else. Simms then quickly reviewed the file – also not saying aloud any details of it – before adjourning. The entire proceeding lasted less than 10 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the courtroom, Sullivan said few words to reporters seeking information about what he gave the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “I would just stay posted,” he said. “Stay tuned.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/no-kings-protests-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Another nationwide day of protest is set for this weekend.

this weekend. Here’s what we know about ‘No Kings’ 2 \n       \n  By Lauren Mascarenhas, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:06 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald  Trump arrived at his military parade  in Washington, DC, this June to a 21-gun salute and members of the crowd singing “Happy Birthday,” about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest his administration. Now, amid an ongoing government shutdown and Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops to American cities, millions are gearing up for round two.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,500 demonstrations – about 450 more than were planned in June – across all 50 states are slated for Saturday in the second round of “ No Kings ” protests, which aim to broadly reject what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican leaders have labeled the protests as anti-American. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed, without evidence, that Saturday’s planned rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the first round of “No Kings” protests took place, Trump had just barreled through the first five months of his second term with  hundreds of executive orders  and other moves targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, student protesters, federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and more.\n \n\n   \n  Tension over immigration raids reached a fever pitch with protests in Los Angeles, where Trump  federalized the California National Guard  against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom – a move that experts warned was an  unprecedented and dangerous escalation  of presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the administration has only “doubled down,” protest organizers say.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents, under pressure to meet the administration’s  arrest quotas , have performed raids throughout the country, sometimes met with fervent protests by community members. Trump has called on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, former FBI director  James Comey  and Attorney General of New York  Letitia James . The administration has challenged unflattering media coverage, resulting in a  defamation lawsuit  against The New York Times and the suspension (and eventual return) of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live! ”\n \n\n   \n  And the administration has escalated its  attempted deployment of federal troops  into Democratic-led cities, like DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state leaders have pushed back against the National Guard deployments, and legal battles are still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican politicians have branded the upcoming protests as “Hate America” rallies. GOP Sen. Roger Marshall alleged “professional protesters” and “agitators” will show up, and Johnson suggested participants would be “pro-Hamas” and “Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  But organizers are planning for peaceful demonstrations aimed at providing a clear contrast to the administration’s recent show of force.\n \n\n   \n    Could the protests prompt more military force?\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Marshall recently said about Saturday’s protests. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the possibility of National Guard deployment to Saturday’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday directed the state’s National Guard to deploy troops to Austin ahead of a planned protest his office characterized as being “antifa-linked.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do — and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them,” Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Indivisible Project, the nonprofit organizing the protest, has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation, and organizers are working directly with cities that have   a National Guard presence to make sure they are prepared, its co-executive director, Leah Greenberg, said.\n \n\n   \n  In other areas, organizers have been working to educate protesters on their rights, in the event troops show up somewhere unexpected.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said Thursday at a meeting of protest organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights,” Greenberg told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already planned another celebratory military show of force in California set to take place on the same day of the protests,  Newsom  noted Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers hope to build on the momentum of June’s protests and the  Hands Off!  and  50501  protests this spring. They’re confident the movement has grown steadily in response to the administration’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  For local leaders who have tried to push back against what they describe as federal overreach in their cities, Saturday may provide an opportunity to send a message.\n \n\n   \n  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is set to headline the No Kings event in her city this Saturday. Following recent protest activity in Boston,  Trump threatened to pull the FIFA World Cup  out of Massachusetts next year, a move Wu says Trump does not have the authority to make.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the protests could prompt the administration to send more military force into cities, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n \n\n   \n  The memorandum Trump used to send the first round of federal troops into Los Angeles can be used to take similar action around the country, Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Under this memorandum, troops can be deployed if there are entirely peaceful protests,” she said, calling it “a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  And almost any violence on the part of individual protesters could end up bolstering the administration’s case for calling in troops, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “So might the administration use the protests this weekend as justification to deploy troops? It certainly looks that way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  As for whether people will see troops on the ground in new locations as protests play out Saturday, Goitein noted that it takes some planning to mobilize troops and direct them to a particular location.\n \n\n   \n  “It can’t be done at the snap of anyone’s fingers, so if we were to see the military deployed at these protests, that means it was in the works beforehand,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    DHS advises local agencies to mitigate potential for violence\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the “No Kings 2” protests, Department of Homeland Security officials are warning about the potential for certain events to become violent.\n \n\n   \n  In a DHS intelligence report sent to law enforcement agencies around the nation Thursday, and obtained by CNN, DHS said it is “concerned” about the potential for violence at the demonstrations, “based on several events in the United States in 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  “Throughout these events, we observed behavioral indicators associated with violence and geopolitical developments that have historically driven violence at similar events,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence brief was meant to make law enforcement aware of indicators of possible violence at protests and ways to mitigate them in advance. It did not indicate that US national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly concerning behavior police should be on the lookout for includes the attendance of demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and demonstrators who have engaged in paramilitary-like training, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Other potentially concerning behaviors included “protesters or counter-protesters engaging in harassing or intimidating behavior, which may escalate to physical violence,” and any indicators individuals may seek to distract and divert police away from an area where criminal activity is planned, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  In order to prevent and counter any possible violence, the intelligence report said law enforcement should communicate with mass transit agencies for awareness of increased travel to a particular area by people from outside the area, and consider limiting protests and counter protests to specific areas.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said law enforcement agencies should also proactively “establish liaisons with the protest organizers and counter-protest groups” and “clearly communicate legal parameters and guidelines to protest and counter-protest organizers so all parties understand the legal limits of activity before enforcement action is taken.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big tent’ protest effort\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown continues to threaten federal workers’ jobs and seeps into daily life, some Republican lawmakers have suggested that the protests are a distraction compounding the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Asked when the shutdown will end, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week, “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting ‘til this crazy No Kings rally this weekend … No Kings equal no paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg called the criticism “transparently ridiculous,” saying the protests were planned in September, before the government shutdown, and are “a big tent effort” encompassing a range of political identities and viewpoints.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg also pushed back against the idea that the protests are anti-American.\n \n\n   \n  “No Kings is about as American a value as you can imagine. It is as American as apple pie,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My husband and I were at the flagship event in Philly in June – the birthplace of the nation, which is why we chose it, and we led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg co-founded the progressive grassroots network Indivisible with her husband Ezra Levin in 2016 in response to Trump’s first election. It’s grown to include thousands of local Indivisible groups, which function autonomously but coordinate with national staff.\n \n\n   \n  The  network encompasses  the nonprofits Indivisible Project and Indivisible Civics, which organize protests and trainings, and Indivisible Action, a separate political action committee aiming to elect progressive candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg said she’s aware that organizations like Indivisible that have taken a public stance against Trump may be targeted by the administration.\n \n\n   \n  After conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s death,  Indivisible joined more than 500 nonprofits  in an open letter condemning what the groups described as the use of government power to target liberal organizations and threaten First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently taken aim at billionaire investor  George Soros  for funding “violent protests,” calling for racketeering charges against the philanthropist, and the White House has called Indivisible a “left-wing activist group” that has “received more than $7.6 million” from Soros.\n \n\n   \n  Soros’ long-running nonprofit,  Open Society Foundations , has provided millions in funding to Indivisible over the years, along with a vast number of predominantly left-leaning causes. Indivisible Project received almost  $8 million in contributions  from various sources in fiscal year 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re heartily aware that there are ongoing efforts to kill organized opposition – to retaliate, to come after people who stand against Trump and his agenda,” Greenberg said. “We’re aware of those things, and also we believe that we have one path forward, which is to continue to exercise our constitutional rights.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/unidentified-palestinian-bodies-handed-over-by-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:36:00Z","title":"Uncertainty surrounds identities of more than 100 Palestinian bodies handed over by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 120 Palestinian bodies, marked only with numbers and showing signs of torture—such as binding, blindfolding, and gunshot wounds—have been handed over by Israel to Gaza.

bodies handed over by Israel \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Abeer Salman, Mohammed al Sawalhi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:26 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Palestinian forensic experts are working to identify 120 bodies returned to Gaza by Israel marked only with numbers, some of whom were blindfolded, bound at the hands and feet, or bearing gunshot wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Under the  ceasefire agreement  reached with Hamas last week, Israel agreed to transfer the bodies of what it called 360 “Gazan terrorists” into the enclave. Israel hasn’t provided any information about their identities or how they died.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether the 120 individuals whose remains were returned this week died in Israel’s custody, in Gaza during the war, or were killed in Israel as they took part in the October 7, 2023, terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, health ministry, foreign ministry, justice ministry and the Israel Prison Service for comment, but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  Only a handful of the 120 bodies have been identified so far. Two were named publicly by family members on social media as having participated in the assault on Israel on October 7, when thousands of Palestinians breached the perimeter fence.\n \n\n   \n  Many were militants who went on to kill 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, mostly civilians, in communities across southern Israel. Others were ordinary Gazans who crossed into Israel but didn’t participate in the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified remains were handed over by Israel to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which then delivered them to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, where forensic experts began examining them.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN each of the bodies had a document that indicated they were, at some point, held at Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert, and that DNA tests had been performed on them there.\n \n\n   \n  The base has been used by Israel as a detention center, where a number of  cases of abuse of Palestinian detainees  had been reported during the war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After the October 7 attacks, Israeli first responders were overwhelmed by the number of bodies found across multiple attack sites.\n \n\n   \n  At that time, members of the ZAKA, an Israeli volunteer search and rescue organization that was  called in to recover the bodies  near the Israel-Gaza perimeter, told CNN that the victims were taken to the Shura Army Base, while remains of the attackers were stored at a different base in the Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at the forensic department at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital described to CNN the state they found the bodies that were handed over this week, saying they showed “signs of abuse and torture.”\n \n\n   \n  “Each martyr is given a number, and all martyrs are bound at the hands and feet. Some are blindfolded, and there are signs of gunshot wounds,” the doctors said.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official said the bodies had broken bones and looked like they had been “crushed by heavy vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has seen photographs, including closeup shots, of some of the bodies. Zip ties, blindfolds, and gunshot wounds are clearly visible on some of them. Most of the bodies appear to belong to young men, and those who are clothed appear to be wearing civilian clothes. Some of the bodies had dirt on them. One with what appeared to be an IV cannula still in the arm.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official told CNN that some of the remains appeared to have been exhumed after burial.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Lawrence Owens, an independent forensic pathologist who looked at photographs of one of the bodies said the person in the picture was almost certainly bound and blindfolded before death, and noted that a fingertip appeared to be missing.\n \n\n   \n  Owens, a research fellow at the University of Winchester, said while the body had lines imprinted on it that appeared to be track marks, it was not nearly as damaged as one would expect if a heavy vehicle had rolled over it. He said, however, that it was possible the body was buried when run over.\n \n\n   \n  Another expert who examined the same photographs also said the deceased individual was bound and that the blindfold was likely applied before death, while the track marks appeared to have been caused after death.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Health has set up a website where it has posted images of the remains in the hopes that family members or friends might be able to identify them. Many of the photographs are extremely graphic, showing wounds and details of partially decomposed bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the remains have already been identified through the website, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n    Mother ‘searched through more than 30 bodies’\n \n\n   \n  Rasmiya Mohammed Khairi Qdeih from the town of Khuza’a in southern Gaza is among those searching for information about her family.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis on Wednesday, she said six of her sons were killed during the war, one has been taken prisoner by Israel, and one has been missing since the day Hamas and its allies in Gaza launched their assault in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Qdeih said she didn’t know whether the son missing from October 7 was dead or alive. She said he did not participate in the attack but went to Israel when the fence was breached to see what was happening.\n \n\n   \n  “I heard news that they had brought the bodies of prisoners, so I ran (to the hospital) to see if he was among them or not,” she told CNN. “Whenever they bring the bodies of prisoners, I come here and search among them. Yesterday, I searched through more than 30 bodies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons (PCMFD) said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel’s omission of an official list of names of the deceased “arouses suspicion and strengthens doubts about practices of enforced disappearance and tampering with victims’ files.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stress the necessity of providing complete information about the bodies being handed over and publishing all available information as soon as it arrives, including the names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths, and immediately notifying the families in respect for their right to know and human dignity,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many more bodies of Palestinians Israel is holding. An Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN last month that the bodies of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was believed to be one of the architects of the October 7 attack, and his brother Mohammed, would not be returned to Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/climate/imo-shipping-carbon-tax-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:14:00-04:00","title":"US helps sink world’s first global carbon tax after threatening sanctions against countries supporting it","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States, under President Donald Trump, successfully blocked the adoption of the world’s first global carbon tax on the shipping industry, which was set to be approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in October 2025.

global carbon tax after threatening sanctions against countries supporting it \n       \n  By Laura Paddison, Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:14 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A fierce Trump administration push to stop the  global shipping industry  from paying for its own climate pollution appeared to have been successful Friday, as efforts to approve the “world’s first global carbon tax” collapsed.\n \n\n   \n  It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted during a summit in London at the International Maritime Organization, the UN-backed body that governs global shipping. But after four days of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a vociferous US campaign, with President Donald   Trump calling it a “scam tax” and the State Department threatening reprisals on countries supporting it.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say the collapse of the talks marks not only a significant blow for attempts to clean up a heavily climate-polluting industry, undermining decades of negotiations, but also represents  yet another failure  of climate diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  IMO member states  agreed in 2023  that the shipping industry would reach net zero emissions — removing as much planet-heating gas from the atmosphere as it emits — by around 2050.\n \n\n   \n  One of the measures proposed as part of this was a tax on the industry’s climate pollution. The shipping industry would have paid the tax into a fund created by the IMO, to encourage emissions reductions and raise funds for climate action. IMO member nations  approved the tax  at a chaotic April meeting that the US abandoned part way through. The October talks were intended to formally adopt it.\n \n\n   \n  While the tax was supported by members including the European Union, Brazil and small island states such as Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the United   States and Saudi Arabia opposed it strongly.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration spent weeks calling on countries to reject the vote. The US will “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the State Department said in a  statement  this month.\n \n\n   \n  It laid out a series of threats against countries that supported the tax including potentially blocking vessels from US ports, visa restrictions, increased fees and sanctions on “officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on Truth Social Thursday, Trump said he was “outraged” at the vote and that the US “would not stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax.”\n \n\n   \n  After days of chaos and disagreement at the IMO talks, Singapore put forward a motion to delay the decision on Friday, which was called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  A legally-binding carbon tax on shipping would have been a big deal. “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at the University of Melbourne.\n \n\n   \n  A State Department official told CNN the vote demonstrates American leadership on the global stage: “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The global shipping industry is responsible for  around 3%  of global planet-heating pollution annually, a figure that could rise to 17% by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a 2018 European Parliament  analysis .\n \n\n   \n  The industry has tended to slip under the radar when it comes to climate action, in part because so much of its activity happens in international waters, making the question of accountability for its climate pollution more complex.\n \n\n   \n  The failure to adopt the tax is a huge missed opportunity, experts say .  “Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly,” said Natacha Stamatiou of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n \n\n   \n  There are also fears about what it means for climate diplomacy. Other recent efforts to tackle the escalating climate crisis have either collapsed, such as attempts to negotiate the world’s first global plastics treaty, or failed to meet hopes, including last year’s COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan,  which ended in bitterness  and a finance deal described by some developing countries as a “betrayal.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts are concerned for what this might mean for ambition levels at the upcoming COP30 climate conference in Belém, Brazil, next month.\n \n\n   \n  The failure of the IMO to adopt a carbon tax “marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph John Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate change minister. “This makes the road to Belém and beyond more difficult.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/mpox-monkeypox-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-04:00","title":"California mpox cases raise concerns.

But health officials say the risk remains low \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   New York (AP)  – Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first US cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case.\n \n\n   \n  The risk to the public is low, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  These are not the US first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.\n \n\n   \n  Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”\n \n\n   \n   Mpox  — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.\n \n\n   \n  One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the US  was averaging  close to 500 cases per day.\n \n\n   \n  The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned  later that year , thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\n \n\n   \n  The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.\n \n\n   \n  A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem  had waned enough  that it was no longer an international emergency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\n \n\n   \n  The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding.\n \n\n   \n  Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”\n \n\n   \n  A US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/jodie-turner-smith-victorias-secret-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00-12:33","title":"Look of the Week: From Jimi Hendrix to Jodie Turner-Smith, why fashion loves a military jacket","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The military jacket, particularly the Hussar pelisse, is experiencing a major fashion resurgence in 2025, inspired by celebrity appearances such as Jodie Turner-Smith, Zendaya, and Jenna Ortega.

Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attention! The fashion set has just deployed a new fall jacket that could become a wardrobe mainstay for us all. Earlier this week at the Victoria’s Secret after-party in New York, Jodie Turner-Smith arrived in a pair of relaxed, low-slung light wash jeans, a white vest and a black, white and red military jacket that looked nothing short of Napoleonic.\n \n\n   \n  Identifiable by elaborate braiding, decorative buttons, and often toggles across the chest, military coats — also known as the Hussar jacket or Pelisse — appear to be making a comeback. While Turner-Smith, who also attended  the brand’s latest runway show  as a VIP guest, got her Hussar coat from Georgian-based brand Keburia, she’s not the only celebrity who has been spotted in military-style outerwear in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  At Paris Fashion Week, Zendaya was snapped outside the Louis Vuitton show at the Louvre, dressed in a metallic, fur-trimmed dress-coat with a Rococo edge. While some fashion enthusiasts may be revisiting Marie Antoinette as a source of sartorial inspiration in the light of  the blockbuster London exhibition dedicated to the French Queen’s style , Zendaya’s look took more cues from King Louis XVI. The following day at Dior, Jenna Ortega was seen in a gothic black sleeveless Hussar vest, the frog fastenings embroidered intricately with gold thread and finished with shining buttons. She completed her look with aviator sunglasses, bleached brows and a denim mini-skirt.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, this isn’t the first time modern dressers have dusted off 18th-century military outerwear in the name of fashion. The late American guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix, who once briefly enlisted in the US army, owned and wore several different types of Hussar pelisses in the 1960s. Hendrix wore the coats unbuttoned, sometimes shirtless, and adorned with pendant necklaces; other times he styled them with vibrant silk scarves or blouses, subverting their original context as strict uniforms for obedient, militant officers.\n \n\n   \n  This playful, bohemian upending of a rigid, historical garment started a wave of subversive iterations from luxury brands, including Saint Laurent, Balmain, Gucci and Marc Jacobs — which in 2002 presented cream wool Hussar jackets trimmed with red and finished in gold stitching, worn with paisley blouses that seemed to be   in the Hendrix style. But when The Beatles wore the decorated military coats of yore on the cover of the 1967 album “Sargent Peppers and the Lonely Hearts Club,” it was less about communicating sex appeal and more about anti-establishment and anti-war sentiments. They wore their delicious, candy-colored satin guard coats buttoned to the top, like four fanciful colonels on the regimen of peace and love.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the Hussar pelisse ironically became something of a uniform in the early aughts for musicians, including Michael Jackson, Beyoncé and Rihanna, and bands such as British alt-indie group The Libertines and US pop-punk band My Chemical Romance. In 2005, Kate Moss, then-girlfriend of The Libertines front man Pete Doherty, led the charge in making the trend mainstream with an ivory version worn to the Glastonbury music festival.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the style is back on our catwalks, as seen at Jonathan Anderson’s debut menswear collection for Dior, as well as in recent collections by McQueen, Vaquera and Ann Demeulemeester. And word spreads fast — according to Molly Rooyakkers, who runs the data-driven fashion Instagram account  @styleanalytics , global searches for “Hussar jacket” have increased 300% in October compared to the previous month.

It’s one of several new safety features from Meta and OpenAI meant to combat growing concerns about how AI could impact teens’ mental health.\n \n\n   \n  Parents will be able to either turn off teens’ access to individual chats with AI characters or just block access to specific characters, the social media giant said in a blog post. The app will also show parents information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters. The company said it’s building the controls now and users will start seeing them early next year.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after Meta and the tech industry more broadly have grappled with criticisms from parents  and lawmakers  that online platforms aren’t doing enough to protect children online.\n \n\n   \n  Concerns have also been raised about whether people are relying on AI for emotional support and companionship. A wave of reports this year have indicated that some   people have endured emotional distress and isolated themselves from family members after developing  close relationships   with chatbots  like ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple lawsuits have been  filed against the company behind Character.AI , another popular app for chatting with AI personas, over allegations that the platform played a role in self-harm and suicide in teens. A lawsuit was also  filed against OpenAI  in August over allegations that ChatGPT contributed to the suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine. And a  Wall Street Journal investigation  from April found that Meta’s chatbot and other AI chatbots on its platforms would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  Meta said its AI characters “are designed not to engage” in conversations with teens about “self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating” or topics that “encourage, promote or enable” those subjects. Teens are also only able to chat with certain AI characters related to content like education and sports, the blog post said.\n \n\n   \n  Instagram’s new parental controls follow other updates the company has recently made to better protect teens. Earlier this week it adjusted its “Teen Accounts” settings to  line up with PG-13 ratings , meaning it won’t show or promote posts featuring strong language or those that could promote “harmful behaviors.” In late September, OpenAI announced parental controls for ChatGPT that reduce “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/sport/football-ncaa-kansei-matsuzawa-japan-kicker","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:44:00-17:10","title":"The NFL hopeful from Japan who learned to kick on YouTube","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kansei Matsuzawa, a 26-year-old placekicker from Ichikawa, Japan, gained global attention after scoring a game-winning 38-yard field goal in the NCAA season opener against Stanford, a moment that capped a journey of self-education, perseverance, and cross-cultural determination.

Since then, Kansei Matsuzawa’s life has never been the same.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old from Ichikawa, Japan, made global headlines on the opening weekend of the  NCAA college football  season after he nailed a 38-yarder as time expired to give the University of Hawaii a dramatic 23-20 victory over Stanford.\n \n\n   \n  It was rich reward for a young athlete who didn’t even know how to kick – or speak English – until he started watching YouTube videos.\n \n\n   \n  “It was one of the best moments in my life. D1 football in America and Japanese kid has big dream,” the young placekicker told  CNN Sports . “In the beginning, when I was in Japan, I had no coaches. So, I feel like I have to do it myself.\n \n\n   \n  “I used YouTube first. I was looking for an  NFL  player on YouTube. I would say (Seattle) Seahawks kicker Jason Myers. I’ve never met him before, but he actually texted me on Instagram after getting the winning field goal and that was amazing. I try to imitate the best of the best and that’s how I started.”\n \n\n   \n  In collegiate sports, the bond between player and coach is often enduringly strong – much more so than at the professional level.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas Sheffield is the Hawaii special teams coordinator who played a key role in bringing Matsuzawa to Honolulu and has nothing but respect and admiration for the life journey Matsuzawa – who has been given the nickname “ the Tokyo Toe ” – has undertaken.\n \n\n   \n  “Who teaches themself how to kick off YouTube? Who goes to America from a completely different country without speaking English and teaches himself basically how to speak English?” Sheffield told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “The word love is used a lot in our profession. I think that as a coach, if you really want to love your players, then you got to get to know your players on a personal level,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa was a stand-out  soccer  player as a teenager, but he failed an exam and didn’t go to college in Japan. His passion, joy and energy were gone. But everything changed when Matsuzawa’s parents offered their son a chance to visit the US.\n \n\n   \n  An  NFL  game between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams that he attended fueled his fire to one day return to America and pursue his dreams. It’s no wonder that winning kick against Stanford was so special for both player and coach alike.\n \n\n   \n  “I really wanted to win that game, especially like week zero. Visualization is really important. I was ready for a game-time field goal and a game-winning field goal. I’m telling myself I am elite. And then focus on myself as one of the biggest things,” Matsuzawa revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Sheffield added: “I was like crying like a baby, I just told him, ‘Man, your parents are here to see this.’ That was the coolest part for me was seeing somebody who works so hard and overcome so many battles and so much adversity to get to that moment. And there’s nobody that deserves it more than this kid because of the journey.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rainbow Warriors kicker has had to work hard for all he’s achieved in life so far and especially so when it comes to finances.\n \n\n   \n  Before moving to the US, he would wait tables back in Japan at his local steakhouse in Tokyo. At one point, he was even cutting his own hair to save money. He would upload clips of his kicking to his social media hoping somebody – somewhere – would take notice and give him a chance.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, a school in Nelsonville, Ohio, did and Matsuzawa credits the time he spent at Hocking College before his move to Hawaii as playing a significant role in greatly improving his English. And then there were huge, selfless sacrifices made by his parents, such as the trip the family took to the US.\n \n\n   \n  So just imagine the joy and elation he went through when he learned, at long last, he was to be awarded a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. It was a moment that would cause him to break down in tears.\n \n\n   \n  “That was amazing. I feel like it’s one of the toughest things to walk on to a scholarship in college football. It’s really tough, but (the) coaches believed in me. That moment is so amazing for me and my family,” Matsuzawa said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re paying my tuition, paying my rent. It was tough for my family. My family moved to a different place, a cheaper house, to help.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment Matsuzawa – who’s majoring in sports management – learned he was getting a life-changing scholarship was actually witnessed first-hand by Sheffield himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one recording it. I got to record it because I knew it was coming. It was one of the most rewarding things when you see a kid who just follows his dreams and meets his potential, and that we just get to play a small part of it. It gets you emotionally. It’s like watching your son achieve a big dream and a big goal and reaping the benefits of all the hard work,” Sheffield said.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa says he’s inspired by his idol and compatriot: baseball superstar  Shohei Ohtani .\n \n\n   \n  “Like everyone, I’m just watching him on TV. But his mindset and his preparation are a different level, and if I want to be like him, I have got to have the same mindset and preparation to perform to the highest level.”\n \n\n   \n  And as for Matsuzawa’s future, it won’t surprise you to learn he’s already dreaming big, hoping one day he might even get to play in the  NFL . And if he does, he would become the first Japanese national ever to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of dreams, but since day one, I’m going to NFL, win Super Bowl, play 10 years in the NFL – you know, big contract!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/north-korea-submunition-russia-ukraine-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00-04:00","title":"North Korean submunition found in drone used to attack Ukraine, report finds","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche calendar references indicating a 2000 production date, was found in a drone used to attack the Kherson port city in Ukraine in September 2025.

attack Ukraine last month, according to a  new report , providing further insight into the extent that Pyongyang is helping Russia wage war on its Eastern European neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  The modified submunition – a small part of a larger weapon – was recovered by Ukrainian authorities following an attack on the port city of Kherson in September, the UK-based investigative organization Conflict

initially designed to be used in a rocket artillery system, it was modified to be attached to a first-person-view drone using a wooden stick, wire and duct tape, CAR said.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “establishes yet another direct material link between the North Korean defence industry and the war in Ukraine,” the investigative organization said.\n \n\n   \n  CAR’s investigation comes as Russia has  ramped up its drone attacks  on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure while rapidly increasing its drone production.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has built a  massive drone factory  to pump out thousands   of weapons, many of which aren’t particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch hundreds in one night.\n \n\n   \n  This is done in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts have said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, North Korea has also  ramped up its weapons program  in the past few years, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang began sending large numbers of troops and equipment to Russia last year. In August, Ukrainian and US intelligence suggested there were roughly 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, the first of whom were sent in the fall of 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Of that initial deployment, about 4,000 soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to Western officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/swimming-lia-thomas-interview-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:49:00-04:00","title":"It’s easier to fight the whole world than to fight yourself: Why transgender swimmer Lia Thomas wouldn’t change a thing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer and former NCAA women’s champion from the University of Pennsylvania, has become a focal point in a global debate over transgender participation in women’s sports.

\n        10:49 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a rare interview,  Lia Thomas  described what life was like as arguably the most prominent transgender swimmer in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas has been the subject of global scrutiny after  winning  a host of NCAA women’s races, triggering an outcry from those who thought she – as a transgender woman – held an unfair advantage over her competitors.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was given extra attention after the Trump administration  ordered  the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), for whom Thomas competed, to erase the transgender swimmer’s records.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Penn  modified a trio  of school records set by Thomas and said it would apologize to the female athletes she competed against.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with Philadelphia-based public media outlet  WHYY  just before Penn’s decision, Thomas spoke about the impact so much attention has had on her life and career.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas last competed for Penn in 2022 and, in 2024, lost a legal battle against the global swimming governing body  World Aquatics  which prevented her from competing in elite women’s races due to its new policy.\n \n\n   \n  As such, her life as a professional swimmer was over.\n \n\n   \n  “I still swim occasionally, just on my own at a local YMCA,” Thomas told WHYY.\n \n\n   \n  “With everything that happened my senior year and has happened since, it’s very easy to slip into almost like a negative perception of swimming, where swimming and being in the water just brings up all that pain and all those feelings of grief all over again and very fresh. It takes a lot of effort to try to focus on the joy that swimming still brings me.\n \n\n   \n  “There are moments where I can just, I can find that escape that it was for me as a child, and just let everything sort of wash away and it feels almost like I’m flying, and it still absolutely, it can be that place of peace and happiness, but it unfortunately takes a concerted effort at times.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding acceptance\n \n\n   \n  In the interview, Thomas spoke openly about how she struggled with  gender dysphoria  during her younger years and said swimming was often a way of escaping her problems.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said she knew she was trans just before starting college and that it felt like a “wonderful realization” before fears about how people would react came creeping in.\n \n\n   \n  “The toughest conversation was the first time I came out to my parents. And that was the most sort of terrified I’ve ever been in my life,” Thomas said, adding her parents were initially confused but supportive.\n \n\n   \n  “They were caught totally off guard. They had no idea; they did not see it coming.\n \n\n   \n  “What I think essentially happened in between that first conversation and the next conversation was they tried to research what being trans was and meant. And, in doing that, fell into essentially transphobic misinformation rabbit holes.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said her parents needed time to accept her desire to transition and that it took them seeing how happy she was to fully understand her decision. She hopes that, ultimately, the same will happen with sections of society and media.\n \n\n   \n  “They parroted a lot of really transphobic talking points, and it caused a lot of harm. But it wasn’t totally unsalvageable,” Thomas said.\n \n\n   \n  “What fixed it, what healed that relationship, was seeing just how much this meant to me. And also after starting hormone replacement therapy, seeing just how much happier I was when I was being true to myself. And every day more that they saw that, they only solidified their support and have come fully around and are now some of my biggest supporters.”\n \n\n   \n    Advice to children\n \n\n   \n  There were times, Thomas said, that she felt the whole world was against her. In those dark moments, she leaned on the support of close family and friends, including  Schuyler Bailar. \n \n\n   \n  Bailar is a transgender man who, like Thomas, swam at a high collegiate level. Now, he works to educate people on trans issues.\n \n\n   \n  When Thomas was asked what she would say to children who might be facing the same issues she faced, she echoed advice that Bailar had given her six years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to fight the whole world than to fight yourself every day,” Thomas said.\n \n\n   \n  “Because when I look back on my journey, on all the difficulties, all the highs and lows, I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s just no substitute to living and being your authentic self. But it unfortunately takes courage because of the many difficulties that there are surrounding being openly trans, especially being an openly trans athlete.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s absolutely worth it, and I know you can do it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-tomahawk-missiles-zelensky-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump hasn’t closed the door on sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has not ruled out sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, despite a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rejected the idea.

Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Zachary Cohen, Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:34 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  did not take the possibility of the US sending long-range  Tomahawk cruise missiles  to Ukraine off the table during  his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin , sources familiar with their conversation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is also not expected to commit to providing the potentially game changing American-made weapons in  his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  at the White House on Friday, two of the sources said, though they cautioned that things can always change once the president is alone in a room with the Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president, in both public and private,  has appeared more willing  to allow Ukraine to obtain the long-range missiles in recent weeks, US officials said. The administration has drawn up plans to provide the weapons to Ukraine, the officials said, in case Trump gives the order, which they stress he can do at any time if he feels it is right.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been holding off, hoping to ascertain from Zelensky a better idea of how he planned to use them, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and his top aides have described the weapons — which have a range of more than 1,000 miles — as potentially turning the tide in the war against Russia. And they’ve said they viewed the possibility of receiving them as an attractive threat that Zelensky hoped would force Putin back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s exactly what it appears to have done — though it remains unclear what, if anything, may have changed since Trump and Putin met in Alaska two months ago that would make the prospect of a peace agreement more likely.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 24 hours before Zelensky was slated to meet with Trump in Washington, Putin made a last-ditch attempt to intervene with the American president and halt all talk of sending the lethal US weapons to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  His lengthy phone call resulted in a promise to have the two leaders meet in Budapest “within two weeks or so,” in Trump’s telling — which appears to have bought Moscow more time as Trump’s desire to reach a peace agreement has grown even further following his administration’s success in Middle East negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, did not drop his new military threats while speaking with Putin on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I did actually say, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump told reporters later that day. “He didn’t like the idea.”\n \n\n   \n  A Trump administration official argued it’s all about leverage: “Why would he give up that leverage? He won’t remove the threat until it’s no longer necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  Another US official echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Trump is looking to bring the war to an end and is focusing on a diplomatic approach first — suggesting the threat of sending Tomahawks to Ukraine is one tool he has at his disposal as part of that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Putin is said to have stressed during the call that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield,  CNN previously reported.  But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n  Putin has previously argued that if Trump chooses to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, it would completely alter the level of US involvement in the war thus far, noting that the weapons would likely require Americans to operate them.\n \n\n   \n  The risk of escalation is also a concern among some US officials, though others said previous steps that appeared escalatory — like allowing Ukraine to have more powerful missile systems or weapons — did not significantly escalate the conflict.\n \n\n   \n   The story headline has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-relationship-history","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00.000-04:00","title":"Jennifer Lopez Doesn’t Believe She’s Ever ‘Truly Been Loved.’ Here’s a Reminder of Everyone She’s Talking About","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Lopez reflects on her romantic history, expressing that she has not always felt 'truly loved' due to partners' inability to emotionally support her, despite her fame and public visibility.

Lopez said it’s difficult being in a romantic relationship when you are famous.\n \n\n   \n  Stern asked: “Do you think you’ve truly been loved?” She paused and responded “no” before switching to “yes,” as she considered if she had “really experienced loving someone.”\n \n\n   \n  “What I learned is it’s not that I’m not lovable,” she said. “It’s that they’re not capable.”\n \n\n   \n  Who’s not capable? Here’s a reminder of the high-profile relationships Lopez has been in over the years.\n \n\n   \n    Ojani Noa\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was married to the Cuban waiter from 1997 to 1998, which is around the time her career took off, thanks to her starring role in the hit film “Selena” about the beloved murdered Tejano singer.\n \n\n   \n  Noa went on to become a model and actor. He also attempted to publish a tell-all about their relationship which Lopez successfully sued to have blocked.\n \n\n   \n    Sean “Diddy” Combs\n \n\n   \n  Lopez had an on-again and off-again relationship with the music mogul from 1999 to 2001 and they were the focus of a great deal of  media attention in that time. \n \n\n   \n  She stood beside him after the couple, Combs’ bodyguard Anthony “Wolf” Jones and the rapper Shyne Barrow, a Combs protégé, were involved in a disagreement at Club New York in Manhattan that ended with gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were injured, and while the men and Lopez were initially arrested, charges against her were soon dropped. Combs and Jones  were later acquitted in the incident .\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Combs split in 2001, and two years later  she told Vibe magazine  infidelity played a role in their breakup.\n \n\n   \n  ”It was the first time I was with someone who wasn’t faithful,” she said. “I was in this relationship with Puff” — that’s the nickname Combs went by at the time — “where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin.”\n \n\n   \n    Cris Judd\n \n\n   \n  She married her former backup dancer in 2001 and in 2013 he shared the story of how his life changed after he was cast to dance in her “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” video in 2000.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Jennifer walks in, I shake her hand and we kinda look at each other – and in my head, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to marry this woman,’” he said during an episode of “Oprah: Where Are They Now?”  as per Huffington Post. \n \n\n   \n  The couple tried to keep their relationship under wraps, Judd said.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess the first introduction to me being with her was when we were at the Oscars. It was just bedlam,” he said. “I’ve never seen so many people concentrated in one place, especially cameras. I knew she was there to do a job, and so I was just that guy who was just by her side.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple finalized their divorce in 2003 — at which time Lopez was already involved with her “Gigli” co-star, Ben Affleck.\n \n\n   \n    Marc Anthony\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was engaged to Affleck (we will circle back to that and him later) from 2002 to 2004 and months after they split, she shocked fans when she married Marc Anthony, the Latino singer and actor.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Anthony collaborated on music together and also co-starred in the 2006 film “El Cantante” which was based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe.\n \n\n   \n  In 2008 they welcomed fraternal twins, Emme and Max.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez  talked to British Vogue  in 2024 about motherhood.\n \n\n   \n  “You always want to put your best foot forward for your kids, you want to lift them up — that doesn’t stop you from being a human being who struggles,” she said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She and Anthony announced their split in 2011,  he filed for divorce the following year  and and it was finalized in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    Casper Smart\n \n\n   \n  The dancer-actor-choreographer was one of Lopez’s longest relationships that didn’t make it to the altar.\n \n\n   \n  While they were on-again and off-again, they dated from 2011 to 2016 and Smart had good things to say about her.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s sweet, funny, nice, easygoing and gracious,”  Smart said of Lopez.  “You can’t ask for anything more. She’s beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  Their breakup was reportedly amicable.\n \n\n   \n    Alex Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Many thought Lopez had met her match in the legendary baseball player.\n \n\n   \n  She and the former New York Yankees shortstop started dating in 2017 and seemed like a match made in social media heaven with their posts of supporting each other in everything from red carpets to yoga class.\n \n\n   \n  The pair got engaged in 2019. But in March 2021, there was some confusion as reports swirled that they had split, only to have them say days later in a statement that they were still a couple after all.\n \n\n   \n  A month later they confirmed that their engagement was off.\n \n\n   \n  “We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so. We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects,” they said in a joint statement. “We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.”\n \n\n   \n    Ben Affleck\n \n\n   \n  Lopez spun the block with this actor-director.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after she and Rodriguez broke things off, Affleck was photographed visiting her Los Angeles home.\n \n\n   \n  First time around, of course, the couple had dated and gotten engaged in 2002 before having a high-profile split in September 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realized that something was awry,” they said in a statement. “We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN at the time that the couple was “taking a break.”\n \n\n   \n  She was with Rodriguez in 2020 when Affleck raved about Lopez  to CNN while promoting his film, “The Way Back.” \n \n\n   \n  He said he had no regrets about making “Gigli” because “I made a great friendship with Jennifer Lopez, who I think is a fabulous person and I’m so excited for her continued success.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think she always got the respect that she deserved, in part, because she was a powerful woman,” he said. “And also because she was a Latina and she was really groundbreaking and nobody wanted to acknowledge that. They just wanted to kind of hate, so it’s nice to see her having that success.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck and Lopez went public with the fact they were back together in July 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Months later he expressed his gratitude for second chances in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, calling his rekindled romance with Lopez “beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  “My life now reflects not just the person that I want to be, but the person that I really feel like I am — which is not perfect, but somebody who tries very hard and cares very much about being honest and authentic and accountable,” he told the publication. “It’s hard to say who benefits more, without going into gossipy detail.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair became  engaged  once again in April 2022, after Affleck surprised Lopez with a proposal while she was in the bathtub.\n \n\n   \n  They eloped in July of that year by  traveling to Las Vegas  with their children and the following month held a lavish wedding on Affleck’s sprawling estate outside of Savannah, Georgia, complete with famous friends like Matt Damon and director Kevin Smith in attendance alongside their families.\n \n\n   \n  She  filed for divorce  from Affleck last year, on the anniversary of their second wedding.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/tech/openai-mlk-sora-pause","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"07:55:00-04:00","title":"OpenAI’s Sora bans Martin Luther King Jr. deepfakes after his family complained","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI has paused user-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora AI platform after facing complaints from the King family, particularly Dr. Bernice A.

take a “whole lot” to pull her away from her current role.\n \n\n   \n  Her comments come after  Dawn Staley , the long-time head coach of the South Carolina women’s basketball team, said she doesn’t believe there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  Staley, who recently interviewed to be head coach of the New York Knicks, also suggested that the  NBA  isn’t ready to have a woman lead an organization.\n \n\n   \n  But Hammon, who recently led the Aces to yet another WNBA championship on October 10, is more optimistic, while acknowledging there needs to be more growth in the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it could happen in our lifetime,” Hammon said to CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “There is really not a good reason why it hasn’t happened already. I think there are qualified women that could coach in the NBA, it’s just the matter of getting that opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star in her 16-year playing career, is one of the female head coaches that many believe could make the transition to the NBA given her incredible record in the game.\n \n\n   \n  She has now guided Las Vegas to three championships in the past four years after  making history  as the first full-time female assistant coach in NBA history by the San Antonio Spurs in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    NBA experience\n \n\n   \n  During her time in San Antonio, Hammon became the first woman to lead an NBA team as a head coach during the regular season, when she took over for Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich after he was ejected during a game.\n \n\n   \n  She has since said she’s interviewed for several head coaching positions in the league.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was in the NBA, in some ways I thought it could happen right away and then in other ways, I thought this is 20 to 30 years from happening,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “If men can lead women, there is no reason why women can’t lead men. Just because it hasn’t been done, doesn’t mean it can’t be done.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, this is basketball. People follow great characters and great leadership. People follow people that they know can help them.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience with the NBA, the players were always great. It’s the higher-ups, that are the decision-makers, that have more of an issue of maybe taking directions from a woman.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether she would be interested in taking a head coaching job in the NBA, Hammon said she was very happy with the Aces.\n \n\n   \n  The 48-year-old has helped create the league’s latest dynasty – a term she’s reluctant to fully accept – and is very content with life in Sin City.\n \n\n   \n  However, she said she would take calls if NBA teams wanted to speak.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been building something now for four years,” she said about her time with the Aces. “I love winning, I love the city of Las Vegas and my bosses that I answer to.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll take calls, but it would take a whole lot to pull me from here.”\n \n\n   \n    Dynasty building\n \n\n   \n  Hammon has been enjoying yet another title celebration this week after Las Las Vegas’ most recent triumph.\n \n\n   \n  The Aces secured the third championship in franchise history with a 97-86 win over the Phoenix Mercury last week to sweep the Finals.\n \n\n   \n  With celebrations down the famed Vegas Strip set for Friday, Hammon is relishing in what she called the hardest championship to win.\n \n\n   \n  The start of the 2025 season was a grueling one for the Aces, who began the year 14-14 before winning their last 16 regular season games.\n \n\n   \n  “It hits a little different this year, just the journey and the routes that we had to go through. It was tough. It’s that more rewarding,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “We  fell short last year , I think everybody had to retool a little bit, reroute, gameplan a little bit differently and find a way to get back on top.\n \n\n   \n  “We went around the mountain, up the mountain, down the mountain, back to the mountain top again and it feels really good this time around for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Many are now calling the Aces basketball’s latest dynasty, but it’s a phrase that doesn’t sit totally comfortably with Hammon.\n \n\n   \n  She does, though, concede her team is “flirting” with the term after dominating the league in recent seasons.\n \n\n   \n  “A dynasty is different because of the culture and standard for what it takes. You see a lot of one-offs in sports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “You got to have a lot of things go your way, you’ve got to have a little luck and you’ve got to get the right pieces and the right pieces playing together at the right time.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/picasso-still-life-guitar-missing-spain-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Picasso painting goes missing en route to exhibition","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 1919 gouache painting by Pablo Picasso, titled 'Still Life with Guitar,' went missing during its delivery to a temporary exhibition at the CajaGranada Cultural Center in Granada, Spain.

EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Spanish  police are investigating the disappearance of a painting by  Pablo Picasso  after it apparently vanished on the way to an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  The 1919 gouache work “Still Life with Guitar,” which measures just 12.7 centimeters by 9.8 centimeters (5 inches x 3.9 inches), was supposed go on display from October 9, as part of a temporary exhibition at CajaGranada Cultural Center in the southern Spanish city of Granada.   \n \n\n   \n  The work is owned by a private collector and was insured for an estimated 600,000 euros ($700,000), the CajaGranada Foundation, which owns the cultural center, confirmed to Reuters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday before the exhibition was due to open, a van belonging to a transportation company arrived at the cultural center as scheduled to deliver works from Madrid, CajaGranada Foundation said in a press statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  All the works were moved in a single, continuous movement from the van to a freight elevator that took all the transportation company employees at once from floor -1 to floor 1, the center said.\n \n\n   \n  The items were then transferred from the elevator to the exhibition hall under video surveillance, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  After verifying the origins of the different packages, the exhibition manager agreed with the transportation company that the delivery would be signed for, ahead of the unpackaging of the pieces the following Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The packages remained under video surveillance at all time over the weekend, and the unpacking began at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, according to the center.\n \n\n   \n  The recordings have been checked and no incidents occurred over the weekend, it said.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-morning, the CajaGranada Foundation staff had finished unpacking the works and had positioned them in the room.\n \n\n   \n  This is when the exhibition curator and head of exhibitions realized Picasso’s “Still Life with Guitar,” known by its Spanish title as “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra,” was missing.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation then reported the missing work to the police, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The video recordings from the weekend were checked and no incidents had occurred, it said.\n \n\n   \n  “An investigation is currently underway, and the investigation is attempting to determine when and where the painting disappeared,” Granada police said in a statement to CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The police said the missing work has been added to the international database of stolen artworks but noted that there is no international police cooperation currently being carried out from Granada.\n \n\n   \n  Thieves have often targeted Picasso’s paintings, which have fetched up to $179 million at auction.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a  Dutch art detective recovered Picasso’s 1938 masterpiece  “Portrait of Dora Maar,” worth $28 million, 20 years after it was stolen from the yacht of a Saudi sheikh off the south coast of France.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021,  Greek police recovered Picasso’s “Head of a Woman”  and Piet Mondrian’s “Landscape with a Mill” almost a decade after they were taken in a daring heist at the National Art Gallery in Athens.\n \n\n   \n  And last year,  Belgian police found Picasso’s stolen painting “Tête”  in a basement in the city of Antwerp.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

World Series with a 3-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers now lead the Brewers 3-0 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series (NLCS) and would become the first defending champion to make the World Series in 16 years.\n \n\n   \n  The Philadelphia Phillies were the last team to achieve that feat in 2009, while no team has won back-to-back World Series since the New York Yankees clinched three in a row between 1998 and 2000.\n \n\n   \n  Brewers pitcher Jacob Misiorowski’s excellent performance from the mound – striking out nine, a Milwaukee rookie postseason record – ensured that Thursday’s game was a tight affair through five innings, but LA took the lead in the sixth on Tommy Edman’s RBI single.\n \n\n   \n  A throwing error from Abner Uribe then allowed Freddie Freeman to score, resulting in the Dodgers going 3-1 ahead and closing out the game.\n \n\n   \n  The chances of reaching the World Series are now heavily stacked in LA’s favor.

Here’s what the experts say \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lindsey Martin’s electricity bill reached $314 in July, the highest bill she had received this year until that point, she said on TikTok. In the video’s more than 4,000 comments, many users reported similar power-bill spikes.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s bill jumped even higher in August to $372, a notable leap from around $150 two to three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was so high, I could not believe my bill was $150,” Martin, a Kentucky-based registered nurse, told CNN over the phone. “And now I wish my bill was $150.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin isn’t alone. Residential electricity costs are on the rise, according to  data  from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The average price of electricity in America has increased 13% since 2022, with the cost of retail electricity expected to grow faster than the rate of inflation, the report says. Some regions, like the Pacific, Middle Atlantic and New England, could see even higher increases than the national average.\n \n\n   \n  The increases have largely been driven by the costs of updating and maintaining the power grid and other necessary infrastructure, particularly in the face of increasingly common severe weather events, according to experts on energy and computing who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But a new technological wave is also driving up electricity bills: The AI boom is boosting electricity demand and power resources as tech giants pour billions into what many believe is the biggest computing shift in decades. OpenAI and Broadcom announced  a partnership  just this week to design and develop 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and systems, more than enough to power a major city.\n \n\n   \n  That trend is only expected to continue. Data centers are projected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a December 2024 report from the  Department of Energy . A  Bloomberg News analysis  found that areas near data centers saw an increase in electricity costs of as much as 267% compared to five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The power industry just isn’t equipped to keep up, said Bob Johnson, an analyst with market research firm Gartner who follows the semiconductor industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Explosion in demand’ for AI\n \n\n   \n  Investment in data centers has moved fast as tech behemoths stake the future of their businesses on AI. Meta said it spent $17 billion in capital expenditures, which typically refers to money spent on data centers and infrastructure, for the quarter that ended in June, while Microsoft said it spent $24.2 billion. Data center construction spending reached  a high of $40 billion  in June, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers likely need to be updated to ensure they have enough capacity to handle new power-hungry AI services and products.\n \n\n   \n  That growth is contributing to more electricity demand than the United States has seen in two decades, leading to a need for more investment in electricity generation and transmission, said Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group that represents electricity buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Other factors behind the increased demand include a shift to electric-based heating systems in homes and new manufacturing plants, according to the Bank of America report.\n \n\n   \n  There weren’t enough data center construction and upgrades in the past to affect consumer prices, said Ram Rajagopal, senior fellow for Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy. But now the AI industry is seeing an “explosion in demand.”\n \n\n   \n  AI tools are also growing increasingly sophisticated, evolving beyond text-based queries to handle complex tasks like generating realistic video clips in a matter of seconds and coding websites from scratch. This means they also require more resources than ever.\n \n\n   \n  “AI is really computationally intensive,” said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.\n \n\n   \n    What goes into your electricity bill\n \n\n   \n  Rates vary by location, but retail electricity prices generally include the “cost of generating, transmitting and delivering” electricity and can sometimes factor in investment in upgrading infrastructure, according to the EIA.\n \n\n   \n  Large buyers of electricity typically pay lower rates because the distribution infrastructure is less complex; power needs to be piped to one location rather than hundreds or thousands of homes, said Johnson. Pricing models haven’t been updated to take into account the surge in data center growth, he said, although that can vary by location.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon, for example,  passed a bill  requiring data centers to “pay for the actual strain they place on Oregon’s electrical grid” so that the costs don’t get passed on to the consumer.\n \n\n   \n  “In other words, the homeowners shouldn’t have to pay for data centers, but that’s not built into the pricing structure,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/soccer-europa-league-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"06:01:00+00:00","title":"UK Authorities Seek to Reverse Decision to Ban Maccabi Tel Aviv Fans from Villa Game","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UK authorities are attempting to reverse a decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in November 2025, citing public safety concerns.

a whole, Thursday Night Football was a good example that the old guys can still sling it.\n \n\n   \n  The contest saw 40-year-old Joe Flacco face 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers as the Cincinnati Bengals hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers and was dubbed the “Icy Hot Bowl” by Rodgers’ Steelers teammate, Cameron Heyward, beforehand.\n \n\n   \n  And despite having a combined age of 81, the two oldest quarterbacks in the NFL currently showed that they can still produce on the top level, with both having productive outings in a high-scoring affair.\n \n\n   \n  In the end though, it was Flacco – making just his second Bengals start since being traded from the Cleveland Browns – who came out on top, with the Bengals winning 33-31.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns – one apiece to Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Noah Fant – as well as orchestrating a  field goal  drive in the final minutes which would turn out to be the decisive score.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco was

And after losing his debut to the Green Bay Packers last week, the Super Bowl XLVII champion got in the win column to keep the Bengals’ season alive at 3-4.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what we do it for is games like that,” Flacco said after the victory. “It came down to the wire just like we know it’s going to. Really, really happy about how the guys just kind of stayed with it for a full 60 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  “Man, our offensive line was going today. We were running the football, protecting, doing a lot of things that we wanted to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh had raced out into a 10-0 lead midway through the second quarter but 20 straight points from the Bengals put them on top at Paycor Stadium.\n \n\n   \n  The teams traded scores until a long 68-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to tight end Pat Freiermuth and the ensuing extra point gave the Steelers a one-point lead with just over two minutes remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But the experienced Flacco was able to put together an eight-play, 52-yard drive which drained the majority of the clock to set up a 36-yard field goal for Evan McPherson which he converted to give the home team a two-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  It left Rodgers and the Steelers just seven seconds to attempt a miracle comeback but it came to nothing and Flacco had his first win in Cincinnati.\n \n\n   \n  “Outstanding. Outstanding. Outstanding. It was outstanding, really,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said of Flacco’s night.\n \n\n   \n  “We scored on, what, like six of the last seven drives maybe? Seven of the last eight. And really early on, we had some drops and some quirky stuff happen that prevented a score there. So, just thought his performance was outstanding. Very calm, collected, led us in the two-minute drive to go win the game.”\n \n\n   \n  A key reason for trading for Flacco was the hope that he’d get their star-studded offense firing and he seems to have done so. Both Chase and Higgins had big nights – Chase had 16 catches for 161 yards while Higgins had six catches for 96 yards, a season high – and the running game had its best outing so far this year, with Chase Brown rushing for over 100 yards for the first time this season.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the defeat, it was a productive evening for Steelers quarterback Rodgers who threw four touchdowns and two interceptions on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  There was a moment of history for the former Green Bay Packers and New York Jets star during the game, as he  moved up to fifth place  in the all-time career passing yards leaderboard, moving past Pittsburgh’s all-time leading passer and long-time contemporary Ben Roethlisberger.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers needed 116 passing yards to pass Roethlisberger and cruised past him with a 15-yard connection with Jaylen Warren in the second quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers finished the game with 64,222 yards, still over 7,000 yards behind Brett Favre in fourth.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers fall to 4-2 but still remain atop the AFC North with a big clash against the Green Bay Packers to come in Week 8 on Sunday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/federal-workers-time-off-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Federal Workers Face Job and Health Dilemma During Shutdown as Furloughs Turn Disciplinary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, essential federal workers — including those at the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Internal Revenue Service — are facing unprecedented pressure to remain on duty.

EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One essential Social Security employee didn’t foresee her surgery being upended by the  federal government shutdown  when she scheduled it for early October.\n \n\n   \n  But the longtime manager decided to postpone the procedure, which would have required her to take two weeks off to recover, fearing that she could lose her job if she was absent from work.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because taking sick leave during the shutdown would result in her being furloughed for those days. What’s more, the furlough notice would be filed under “disciplinary and adverse actions” in her employee record — an unprecedented categorization during a funding lapse, according to a Social Security union leader and outside experts in government service. (CNN has viewed the agency’s FAQ instructing supervisors to store furlough notices under that designation.)\n \n\n   \n  Between that potential black mark and the  general sense of anxiety  pervading her office, the employee said she felt, “This is not the time. I could not take a chance on having weeks of furlough and being laid off.”\n \n\n   \n  Essential workers at several federal agencies said they are worried about taking time off or are being told that requests for leave would not be granted during the shutdown, which began on October 1 after Congress failed to agree to a federal spending package. It’s adding to the insecurity they have felt all year as the Trump administration overhauls and downsizes the federal workforce.\n \n\n   \n  A government shutdown is often stressful both for furloughed employees, who are not allowed to work, and for certain essential staffers, who must still report for duty, because  neither group is paid  until after the shutdown ends. But this impasse is even more fraught because President Donald Trump is threatening federal workers’ jobs and their ability to get back pay.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already issued  reductions in force, or RIF, notices  to about 4,100 federal workers over the past week — a move that a  federal judge paused  on Wednesday, declaring it unlawful — and has warned  it will lay off thousands  more during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has called into question a 2019 law that guarantees that furloughed workers will receive  retroactive compensation  once the government reopens, though lawmakers remain far from reaching a deal.\n \n\n   \n  One employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs told CNN that his supervisor asked him if he was sure he wanted to take his preapproved time off during the shutdown, a question he’d never been asked before and one that put him on edge. He thought about canceling his vacation, but decided not to, despite being unsure whether he’ll be paid for those days and whether his absence will jeopardize his career.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m mad, so I’m just going to take it off,” he said — though the uncertainty casts a shadow over his vacation.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s standard for essential employees to be listed as furloughed for the hours or days they miss work during an impasse, that designation is more risky now, workers said.\n \n\n   \n  “It shows who the agency can run without,” the Social Security manager said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about categorizing furlough notices as “disciplinary and adverse action,” a Social Security Administration spokesperson said, “SSA has followed its standard practice for how it manages furlough activities during a government lapse in appropriation, including how we provide notice to staff on their furlough status and where we have always stored the notices in our personnel records.”\n \n\n   \n    Mixed messages on leave\n \n\n   \n  Internal Revenue Service employees in Atlanta have received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off,” Denise Wells-Gomez, National Treasury Employees Union chapter president, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave).\n \n\n   \n  One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren’t present the day they decide to do an audit.\n \n\n   \n  However, during a staff meeting, the director of the IRS Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave if it was approved by their manager. Despite that, employees continued receiving instructions that “no exceptions” would be allowed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, at the VA, a regional director informed staffers that they could take leave that had already been approved before the shutdown, but no new leave would be authorized, the agency employee told CNN. The worker’s supervisor said the same thing.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS and VA did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple employees in different Social Security offices have told Joel Smith, their union representative, that their supervisors have said that if they don’t show up for work, they could be let go. Having their furlough notices filed as a disciplinary action — which he said has not happened in the past — is compounding their concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “People are feeling they have to choose between their job and their health,” said Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which represents about 6,000 Social Security workers in offices across the South and Southwest.\n \n\n   \n  Taking a day off during a shutdown is not dishonorable, said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on improving the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Having it “be a black mark on your record is, as they say, piling mistreatment upon mistreatment, and, to my knowledge, has never been done before,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/wisconsin-man-tiktok-ice-agents-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:58:00-04:00","title":"Wisconsin man charged after posting TikTok videos calling for the killing of ICE agents, prosecutors say","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Andrew Stanton, has been charged with threatening federal law enforcement agents, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, after posting multiple threatening TikTok videos between August and October 2025.

charges, including threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a US official, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  His arrest comes amid heightened tensions nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operations and criticism over  aggressive tactics  observed to be used by immigration agents. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and that its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  Stanton pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Thursday in US District Court in Milwaukee.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Stanton was behind multiple threatening TikTok videos posted from various accounts between August and October this year, according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  In one video posted four days before his arrest, Stanton allegedly called for ICE agents to be targeted, saying in the video, “If they (ICE) show up to your neighborhood…it’s time we start shooting at you,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Stanton’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to the  New York Times , John Bradley, a lawyer for Stanton, said: “It is important to remember that the contents of a criminal complaint represent one side of the story and are just allegations. Mr. Stanton pled not guilty. He is presumed innocent, and we will vigorously defend against these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Stanton is also accused of suggesting that mass shootings can be applied to federal agents, prosecutors said, citing a video posted in September. He also keyed on the September 10 murder of conservative political activist  Charlie Kirk , saying “do a lot more Charlie Kirks,” in a video posted that same day, the complaint alleges.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities started looking into Stanton’s online activity in August after a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, a federal office that tracks suspected terror activity. Federal investigators flagged that an account registered to Stanton asked for information about the whereabouts of members of the Israeli military in the Illinois and Wisconsin area, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  A video posted near the end of August also featured Stanton with text superimposed on the screen that read in part, “a violent state can only be stopped with violence in return” and “I think we should be OFFING federal agents,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to use bullets,” he was quoted as saying in the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal law enforcement officers tried to interview Stanton multiple times, in person and over the phone, in early September but were unsuccessful, the complaint said.\n \n\n   \n  On September 11, a supervisor with US Customs and Border Patrol identified himself by first name in a text to Stanton and said he wanted to speak with him about his recent posts. In response, Stanton told him to go away, using an expletive, and sent a series of hostile messages, as well as one asking to meet in person, the complaint alleges.\n \n\n   \n  A pretrial conference in Stanton’s case is scheduled for December 1, and his trial is scheduled for December 15, according to federal court records.

to Olympic champion: Meet snowboarding superstar Su Yiming \n       \n  By Ben Church, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:02 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In 2022, just days before his 18th birthday, Chinese snowboarder  Su Yiming  found himself atop an Olympic podium with a gold medal hanging around his neck.\n \n\n   \n  The 17-year-old had just won the men’s big air final at the Beijing  Winter Olympics , a moment which changed his life in unimaginable ways.\n \n\n   \n  In truth, Su was already well-known by some in China. He had found fame as a child actor in several movies before switching his attention to professional snowboarding in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  But after winning gold – and a silver in the slopestyle event – at his home Games, his profile soared higher than he could ever have imagined.\n \n\n   \n  Luxury brands came barreling in, wanting to partner with the man of the moment who captured the imagination of China’s younger generation.\n \n\n   \n  Suddenly, his face was everywhere, from fashion shoots to television appearances. Su was a superstar.\n \n\n   \n  Now boasting over 300,000 followers on  Instagram  and over 2,000,000 on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Su is one of the most recognizable faces heading into next year’s Winter Olympics in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel really honored and feel really lucky to have so many people who always look at me,” he tells  CNN Sports  from a training camp in Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m always looking up to my idols, in snowboarding or even in life, so I really know what it means to the younger generation to look up to their idol.\n \n\n   \n  “I really try to be better, and try to show young people that once you have a dream, once you have something you love, just putting 100% to go chase for your dream, and then it will come one day.”\n \n\n   \n    Path to Mount Olympus\n \n\n   \n  Su’s rise to Olympic champion is no accident.\n \n\n   \n  Both his mom and dad were snowboarders and he remembers finding himself playing on the slopes from the age of four, when his parents couldn’t find anyone else to look after him.\n \n\n   \n  At first, he used a board that was bigger than he was. It took a while, almost five years, before he grew into it.\n \n\n   \n  By then, the slopes in northern China became his second home. It’s a place which feels totally natural to Su. In today’s fast-paced world, where he finds himself being pulled from one major city to another, the 21-year-old still longs to spend time out in the wild, where the only thing that matters is having fun on his board.\n \n\n   \n    Life as a film star\n \n\n   \n  But before he became a sporting icon, Su’s first break into the public consciousness came in the world of acting.\n \n\n   \n  When producers of a new film were looking for a child who was comfortable on the snow, Su swapped out his board for skis to play Zi Shuan in the popular film “The Taking of Tiger Mountain.”\n \n\n   \n  The film and his character struck a chord with the Chinese public and Su saw his acting career blossom, going on to feature in several other films and television series.\n \n\n   \n  “That memory just gives me a really special feeling,” he said, looking back at his time as a child actor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m pretty sure a lot of people at that age can’t experience so many crazy things. It’s pretty crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  But while his acting career went from strength to strength, he never let go of his love for snowboarding and a fire was lit in his heart after Beijing was picked to host the 2022 Winter Games.\n \n\n   \n  He turned his attention full-time to the sport in 2018, competing in his first proper competition a year later where his potential was clear to see.\n \n\n   \n    Making of a champion\n \n\n   \n  Whether he performed well or poorly in competitions, the youngster kept dreaming of making it to the Olympics and dedicated his entire life to improving.\n \n\n   \n  Then, after a stellar year before the Games, Su was chosen to represent his nation. What happened next, was just the icing on the cake.\n \n\n   \n  He won two medals, the first a silver and then the magical gold. It was the defining moment of his young life.\n \n\n   \n  But after the fanfare died down, Su was left with a hole. For most of his teenage life, he had dreamed of winning gold at the Winter Olympics. Once he achieved his wildest ambition, there was a period of transition where he lost his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of lost my passion for competing,” he said. “I still loved snowboarding, but I decided to take a year and a half off to take some rest for my mental and also for my body.\n \n\n   \n  “Every morning I woke up, there was a dream, some goal you wanted to chase for, that’s why you put in your 100% and work really hard.\n \n\n   \n  “But right after I won the gold, the next morning I woke up and thought there was nothing else I wanted. It feels really empty at that point.”\n \n\n   \n  Much like other sporting prodigies, such as US tennis star  Amanda Anisimova , Su spent the ensuing months recharging his batteries. He enjoyed time off with family and friends, immersing himself in nature and pursuing his other interests, such as fashion.\n \n\n   \n  “I still got out snowboarding, but just without any purpose, and not for competition, just trying to have fun,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that definitely helped. I felt like I just needed some time to take a rest – snowboarding is just a part of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  After that reset, he returned to competitive snowboarding with a new ambition of retaining his Olympic title in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  Life, for him, looks very different heading into his second Winter Games and Su knows there will be a target on his back during the competition.\n \n\n   \n  “I got more pressure going into the next Olympics because, for the last one, I was just kind of a nobody, and it was just more about challenging myself,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “People are expecting more from you, and that’s why you feel pressure from yourself. But I spent a lot of time talking to my family and I took those years off after the Olympics to set my mind in the right spot. I use those pressures for motivation.”\n \n\n   \n    Pool, fishing and surfing\n \n\n   \n  Su knows he’s in the privileged position of being in high demand. He has ventures in several different fields and is growing his profile around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s exhausting just hearing about the things such a young man can fit into his 24 hours, but it’s a schedule that seems to energize him.\n \n\n   \n  But balance, he said, helps him enjoy his often hectic life and career.\n \n\n   \n  While his stock is rocketing around the world, the skateboarding sensation remains humble, grounded by those who know him best.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a pretty chilled guy, especially when I’m back home. It’s the time you can finally relax,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been enjoying spending time with family, just eating dinner together and then having a conversation. That feels really special, it’s like recharging.\n \n\n   \n  “Also, when at home, I go play pool with my friends and I go fishing and surfing. I’m not the guy who wants to be at home and watch his phone or a movie. I’m trying to get close to nature and doing a lot of stuff that feels like I’m connected to nature.”\n \n\n   \n  But the world is set to see the other side of Su in February next year, the one capable of being the best snowboarder on the planet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:10:00-04:30","title":"Commander overseeing US forces in the Caribbean to retire one year into tenure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Admiral Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command and responsible for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean, is retiring at the end of 2025, one year after assuming office.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:10 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean, where the US has carried out multiple legally ambiguous strikes against alleged drug cartels, is retiring one year into his tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post on X on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The news comes  just days  after the US military conducted its fifth known strike on a boat alleged to be trafficking drugs off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It also comes one day after President Donald Trump said publicly that he had  authorized the CIA  to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flow of drugs and migrants. Also on Wednesday, US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions came to a head during a meeting between Hegseth, Holsey and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on October 6 at the Pentagon, one of the sources said. Holsey offered to resign during the meeting, the source said, but the idea was tabled and his departure was not announced until over a week later. His departure will also not be imminent — instead, he’ll retire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon’s spokesperson Sean Parnell denied on X that Holsey ever expressed reservations about the counter-narcotic mission in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey confirmed in a statement on X that on December 12, 2025, “I will retire from the US Navy.”\n \n\n   \n  “Serving as your commander and deputy for the past 34 months has been a tremendous honor,” Holsey wrote. “The SOUTHCOM team has made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so. I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the US Navy nor Southern Command have responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey was sworn in as the commander of Southern Command in November 2024. Holsey’s predecessor, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, served as the Southern Command commander from 2021 to 2025 before retiring.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey has served in uniform for 37 years since commissioning from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps in 1988, according to his official Navy biography.

to pay your employer money if you quit your job \n       \n  By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most people go to work for the paycheck and benefits. What they typically don’t expect is to have to return   some of the money   when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  But with some benefits — such as signing or retention bonuses, tuition reimbursement and some forms of training — workers may have to pay their employer back if they’re subject to a so-called stay-or-pay agreement, which specifies that the employee will be on the hook to repay the company for the cost of certain benefits if they don’t stay at the organization for a minimum amount of time.\n \n\n   \n  Why? On the one hand, “employers are trying to get a reasonable return on their investment,” said Jonathan Crook, a partner at Fisher Phillips, which represents management in labor and employment matters.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, paying for benefits intended to attract or retain employees only to have them get the benefit and then quit — and potentially work for a competitor — doesn’t offer a great ROI for the employer.\n \n\n   \n  But there are some instances when “stay or pay” agreements are viewed as abusive and limiting employee mobility, especially when they apply to lower income workers and involving what are called training repayment agreements (sometimes referred to, especially by critics, as TRAPs).\n \n\n   \n  “TRAPs are often forced on workers as a condition of employment and require workers who receive on-the-job training — regardless of the quality or necessity of that training — to pay back the supposed cost if they leave their job before the end of a specified term,” Chris Hicks, a senior policy adviser at consumer advocacy group Protect Borrowers,  wrote  in a blog.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, they might charge a quitting fee of thousands of dollars, should an employee leave for another job.\n \n\n   \n  Even if a contract is not enforced, labor advocates say, just knowing of its existence still can pressure employees into staying rather than seeking a better job elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how widespread stay-or-pay agreements are. Researchers from the University of Michigan, Cornell University and the University of Maryland estimated that such agreements — including anything from on-the-job training to paying for an employee’s MBA program — could affect as many as  1 in 11 workers (8.7%) .\n \n\n   \n  Historically, according to a  2023 report  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Employers’ use of TRAPs began in the 1990s, predominantly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions, such as engineers, securities brokers, and airline pilots. Still in use in those industries, they are now also common in lower- and moderate-wage industries where jobs are disproportionately held by women and minorities, such as in the healthcare, transportation, and retail industries.”\n \n\n   \n    New California law bans certain provisions, allows others\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a first-in-the-nation  measure  banning certain stay-or-pay provisions and putting guardrails around others. It takes effect on January 1, 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Among the new prohibitions: California-based employers may not seek repayment for on-the-job training, except for apprentice programs approved by the  Division of Apprenticeship Standards . And they may not seek repayment for any type of benefit when a worker is let go without cause or their job is eliminated.\n \n\n   \n  But the new law still allows employers to impose some types of stay-or-pay agreements if they meet certain guardrails. Among those still allowed in addition to approved apprentice programs are signing or retention bonuses, government-sponsored loan repayment assistance and tuition reimbursement but only for “transferable credentials” (meaning a degree or certificate from an accredited third party that is not specific to the person’s job). In terms of bonuses and tuition reimbursement, if an employee leaves sooner than the stay period, the amount of money they need to repay must be prorated. So if an employee gets a signing bonus but only stays at the company for half the time required, they will only need to pay the company half the amount when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  Employees also must have the option to take their bonus when they leave the company rather than when they start, so they don’t risk owing money if they leave before the end of the stay period — which will now be limited to two years and may not include interest accrual.\n \n\n   \n  The move was welcomed by the California Nurses Association, which represents one of the industries in which such stay-or-pay agreements have been used. “With the threat of having to pay back a debt or fee to their employer, ‘stay-or-pay’ contracts indenture workers to remain at a job and chills workers from seeking better wages or working conditions,” the union said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  It is too early to predict how the new law will influence the way employers operating across multiple states, including California, might draft their own stay-or-pay provisions, Crook said.\n \n\n   \n  Or how many other states may follow in California’s footsteps.\n \n\n   \n  Protect Borrowers notes that there have been legislative efforts to restrict stay-or-pay agreements in several other states, including New York, which passed the “Trapped at Work Act” in June, although it has yet to be signed by Governor Kathy Hochul.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/why-the-bolton-indictment-is-different-from-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Why the Bolton indictment is different from the Comey and James cases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, is charged with 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, including sharing sensitive data with family members without proper clearances.

He allegedly shared the information with family members who didn’t have security clearances.\n \n\n   \n  That rapid progression means Bolton’s indictment will often be lumped in with Comey’s and James’s as an example of Trump weaponizing the justice system against his foes. Trump’s role in orchestrating the charges against Comey and James has certainly warranted that narrative, given it has  no parallel in decades of American politics .\n \n\n   \n  “Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,” Bolton said in a statement late Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s lawyer Abbe Lowell denied that Bolton had kept or shared classified information and said records he claimed the charges stem from were “known to the FBI as far back as 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are also some key differences in Bolton’s case and suggestions that it could be more substantial than those brought against James and Comey.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s dig in.\n \n\n   \n    The differences\n \n\n   \n   The way the case was brought \n \n\n   \n  In Bolton’s case, there is less of a throughline between Trump’s conduct and the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Bolton is also someone Trump spotlighted for prosecution, like Comey and James. As far back as 2020, Trump accused Bolton of breaking the law and warned there would be “a really big price to pay.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now he will have bombs dropped on him!” Trump  said .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump doesn’t appear to have played a similar role in orchestrating the charges against Bolton, at least from what we know. He didn’t publicly push for the charges as much in recent weeks. And he certainly didn’t force out a prosecutor who resisted the charges before installing a loyalist who brought them, like he did in the Eastern District of Virginia (the site of the Comey and James cases).\n \n\n   \n  The Bolton charges also were ultimately brought by experienced prosecutors, including US Attorney Kelly O. Hayes, who has served in the District of Maryland since 2013, and nonpartisan career prosecutor Tom Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  In Comey’s and James’s cases, Trump’s handpicked US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was essentially forced to bring the charges herself, after other prosecutors balked or were removed.\n \n\n   \n   A judge once suggested Bolton might have broken the law \n \n\n   \n  That Bolton is facing charges isn’t nearly as surprising. In fact, a federal judge back in 2020 basically warned of exactly that.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in Bolton’s favor in a civil case stemming from a dispute with the Trump administration over the publication of Bolton’s book. But Lamberth otherwise  excoriated Bolton  for his handling of classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Lamberth said in  his ruling  that Bolton “likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,” Lamberth said in his conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s charges are somewhat different than the issues in that civil case, in that Bolton is charged with retaining and transmitting sensitive information, rather than publishing it in his book as the administration claimed back then. But Lamberth certainly felt Bolton had played fast and loose with this information, which is at the heart of the charges.\n \n\n   \n  There are also other reasons to believe this case is more substantial.\n \n\n   \n  Those include the fact that a judge greenlit  a search of Bolton’s properties  back in August. CNN has also reported that, while the Biden Justice Department didn’t bring these charges, this particular focus of the investigation began under the Biden administration. And the indictment also includes much more detail than the Comey and James indictments, suggesting a more thorough investigation.\n \n\n   \n   The stakes \n \n\n   \n  What Bolton is accused of is, quite simply, a much bigger deal than Comey’s alleged false statement to Congress and James’s alleged mortgage fraud – an alleged offense which even the available evidence suggests would  only have netted her a few thousand dollars .\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton isn’t just accused of retaining and transmitting the information; the indictment also claims this information could have been exposed to hostile foreign actors.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment states that, sometime in the two years after Bolton left the White House in 2019, “a cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran hacked BOLTON’s personal email account and gained unauthorized access to the classified and national defense information in that account.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment says Bolton notified the government of the hack but not the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said that, if that can be proved, it will show Bolton’s mishandling of classified information  to be more serious  than the series of prominent politicians facing similar problems in recent years – including Hillary Clinton and Trump himself.\n \n\n   \n    The similarities\n \n\n   \n   Trump has singled out Bolton \n \n\n   \n  Even as Trump didn’t publicly push as hard for Bolton’s prosecution in recent weeks – he generally seemed more content to let the process play out and say relatively little, compared to James and Comey – there is no question he has targeted Bolton for retribution.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Trump has explicitly accused Bolton of crimes and suggested he should be prosecuted, which isn’t what presidents are supposed to do.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton said Thursday that Trump’s calls for retribution against him “became one of his rallying cries in his reelection campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  For another, Trump has singled Bolton out for punishment in other ways, including stripping him of his  security clearance  and even canceling his  security detail , despite Bolton having faced an alleged assassination threat from Iran.\n \n\n   \n  And Bolton’s name also appeared on now-FBI Director Kash Patel’s list of “deep state” members in his 2023 book – a list critics have labeled an “enemies list.” Indeed, two people on that list have now been indicted (Bolton and Comey), and others have faced investigations even at this early juncture in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other prominent DOJ officials also  made a show of publicizing the Bolton search  back in August, in ways that are not normal.\n \n\n   \n  “NO ONE is above the law…  @FBI  agents on mission,” Patel posted around 7 a.m., right around the time the search was conducted.\n \n\n   \n  All of these data points suggest the politicization of this matter, whether or not the charges are ultimately warranted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/15/us/airport-cyber-breach-pennsylvania-canada-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"03:21:00-04:00","title":"Apparent hackers take over PA systems at 4 North American airports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Unauthorized pro-Palestinian political messages, praising Hamas and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were broadcast through public address systems at four North American airports—Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), Kelowna (British Columbia), Victoria (Ontario), and Windsor (Ontario)—on October 17, 2025.

American airports \n       \n  By Martin Goillandeau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:21 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Unauthorized pro-Palestinian political messages praising Hamas and attacking President Donald Trump and Israel’s prime minister were broadcast through public address systems in terminals at four airports in North America on Tuesday, disrupting operations and sparking investigations into the apparent hacks.\n \n\n   \n  Videos posted by passengers on social media show the unauthorized recordings played at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents were also reported at Kelowna International Airport and Victoria International Airport in British Columbia along with Windsor International Airport in Ontario, according to Transport Canada, which regulates airports in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the messages praise Hamas and, using expletives, are critical of the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “This is absolutely unacceptable and understandably scared travelers,” US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on  social media , adding the FAA is working with the Harrisburg airport “to help get to the bottom of this hack.”\n \n\n   \n  The breaches come as the air travel industry has been dealing with an onslaught of cyberattacks that have caused disruptions for customers and ground some of the world’s largest airports to a halt. In June, a notorious cybercriminal group  breached the computer networks  of multiple airlines in the US and Canada, according to the FBI. And last month,  hackers knocked out  a passenger check-in system, causing long delays, cancellations and chaos at airports across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  At the Harrisburg airport Tuesday, “an unauthorized user gained access to the airport PA system and played an unauthorized recorded message,” airport spokesperson Scott Miller told  CNN affiliate WGAL .\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Glen Brown said at first he was confused at what he was hearing, but then he started worrying about what else could be going on.\n \n\n   \n  “You had to do a double-take and ask yourself if what you were hearing was actually real,” he said. “The real question I have is, if they hack the paging system in an international airport, what else are they tunneling into?\n \n\n   \n  “The message was political in nature and did not contain any threats against the airport, our tenants, airlines, or passengers. The PA system was shut off, and the incident is under investigation by police,” the statement from Miller added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Harrisburg International Airport Police Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration for comment.\n \n\n   \n  During the incident, one flight was in the process of boarding, Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution, the aircraft was searched. No security issues were found, and the flight departed safely,” the statement added.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, more than 2,000 miles away, Kelowna International Airport reported a similar incident.\n \n\n   \n  “The airport staff was about as in the dark as we were,” one passenger who was waiting for a flight said. “They even had to resort to using megaphones to give people boarding information because the intercom was down.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  shared with CNN, the airport said a third party accessed both its flight information display screens and public address system.\n \n\n   \n  “Free Palestine,” and pro-Palestinian chants could be heard in a video posted by the passenger on social media who told CNN: “Nobody informed us what was going on, there was no crisis response. Everyone was just really confused.”\n \n\n   \n  Messages praising Hamas in its war with Israel were also broadcast on screens inside Kelowna airport, according to multiple photos shared on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Kelowna airport officials said the unauthorized messages were removed and flight display systems restored, adding efforts to fully restore the PA system were ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  At Victoria International Airport, “an unauthorized audio message” was also broadcast over the public address system due to “a cloud-based software issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank our passengers for their patience and cooperation,” the airport said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  At Windsor International Airport, the terminal was nearly empty because there were no flights immediately arriving or departing, airport President Mark Galvin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team responded quickly, removed the images and shut off the recorded PA announcement,” he said. “We returned to normal shortly thereafter and have been operating without incident.”\n \n\n   \n  Transport Canada tells CNN it is “working closely with federal security partners, including law enforcement, to ensure there were no impacts on the safety and security of airport operations, and to mitigate disruption from similar incidents in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for more information.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with further details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/india/india-us-trump-russia-oil-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Trump Claims India Agreed to Stop Buying Russian Oil; India Denies It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop India’s purchases of Russian oil, a claim India firmly denies.

New Delhi says it knows nothing about it \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:22 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   India  has seemingly pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s claim it had agreed to stop importing Russian oil, signaling the issue that has strained ties is unlikely to be resolved soon.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “assured me today that they (India) will not be buying oil from Russia,” which is subject to US sanctions, describing it as a “big step.”\n \n\n   \n  But on Thursday India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters he was “not aware of any conversation” between Trump and Modi, or any assurance from the Indian leader that he would stop purchasing Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, India’s foreign ministry said the country was a “significant importer of oil and gas,” without naming Russia nor referencing Modi’s purported assurance.\n \n\n   \n  “Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  India has long maintained close ties with the Kremlin and is due to host Russian President Vladimir Putin later this year. It has emerged as one of the top buyers of Russian oil since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The war sparked massive sanctions against Moscow’s oil industry and sent prices cratering.\n \n\n   \n  For months, New Delhi has resisted Trump’s calls  to cease purchasing Russian oil,  saying it would not bend over the energy needs of its booming economy and growing population, now at more than 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump announced an additional 25% tariff on India as a penalty for importing Russian oil and gas, building on a previously announced 25% tariff rate.\n \n\n   \n  It would be almost impossible for India to suddenly halt purchases of crude from Russia, its largest supplier, said Muyu Xu, a senior oil analyst at trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n \n\n   \n  Russia delivered roughly 1.7–1.8 million barrels per day, according to Xu, who cited figures covering the first nine months of this year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think India can stop buying Russian oil overnight. The volumes are simply too large,” she told CNN. “Replacing that volume from the spot market is no easy task. Beyond the sheer quantity, differences in crude quality and refinery yields make substitution far from a one for one swap.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from Kpler shows state-owned refiners trimmed back Russian purchases in recent months, while some private players increased their intake of Russian barrels.\n \n\n   \n  The state-owned Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 10.35 million barrels of Russian oil in January compared to 4.62 million barrels in September, data from Kpler shows. So far in October, Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 7.03 million barrels, the data showed.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Indian Oil Corporation Limited to ask if it plans to continue purchasing Russian oil and the factors guiding their strategy of sourcing from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Modi’s refusal to kowtow to US pressure plays to his political brand built around the image of a strong leader helming an India that is focused on its own interests on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, officials from New Delhi and Washington have focused on diplomacy to get the relationship back on track, with trade delegations focusing on closing a deal.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar acknowledged that India “has issues with the United States,” attributing a significant portion of the friction to unresolved trade negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that the two countries “have not arrived at a landing ground for our trade discussions,” but said that India is actively working to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  “Those issues need to be negotiated and discussed and resolved, which is exactly what we are trying to do,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/dave-taylor-symbol-american-flag","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:44:00-04:00","title":"GOP Lawmaker Claims His and Other Republican Offices Have Been ‘Targeted’ with Flags Depicting ‘Vile’ Symbol","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican Representative Dave Taylor of Ohio claims that his office and other Republican offices have been targeted with American flags altered to include a 'vile' symbol, which he suspects is a swastika.

Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  John Bolton, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser-turned-adversary,  was indicted by a federal grand jury  in Maryland on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton, the  third high-profile Trump political enemy  to be indicted in less than a month, now faces eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.\n \n\n   \n  Essentially, prosecutors say, Bolton kept — and shared with family members — digital diaries of his activities that included all kinds of classified material from when he was national security adviser.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment, Bolton shared “more than a thousand pages” of “diary-like entries” “that contained information classified up to the TOP SECRET” level.\n \n\n   \n  The charges unveiled Thursday are the result of a criminal investigation that began in 2022 after Bolton’s emails were hacked by Iran.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton is expected to surrender himself, as soon as Friday, to authorities at federal court in Greenbelt, but a hearing has not been scheduled.\n \n\n   \n    What are the allegations?\n \n\n   \n  Bolton would allegedly take handwritten notes from his day at the White House and other secure locations then rewrite them on his computer. Those entries, prosecutors say, were printed and remained on personal devices used by Bolton and others in his home.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolton used his personal non-governmental email accounts, such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google, to email information classified” to the individual’s personal email accounts, the indictment states.\n \n\n   \n  “Often, Bolton’s notes described the secure setting or environment in which he learned the national defense and classified information that he was memorializing in his notes,” prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The purpose Bolton stated of creating a group chat in which he would later share his notes taken during his work as a national security adviser, the indictment says, was “For Diary in the future!!!”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI’s investigation revealed that John Bolton allegedly transmitted top secret information using personal online accounts and retained said documents in his house in direct violation of federal law,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors made use of Bolton’s voluminous media commentary on the sharing of classified information and use of encrypted chats to make the case that the former national security adviser has a strong “understanding of how to properly handle classified information and the potential consequences of failing to do so,” according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  In one criticism of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time leading the State Department – cited by the indictment – Bolton said in 2017, a year prior to his service under Trump, “if I had done at the State Department what [senior U.S. Government official] did, I’d be [imprisoned] right now.”\n \n\n   \n    Bolton says he’s a victim of Trump’s DOJ\n \n\n   \n  Bolton issued a statement Thursday night saying he has become Trump’s latest target in the weaponization of his Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  He said that his book, “The Room Where It Happened,” was reviewed and approved by “the appropriate, experienced career clearance officials” and that the FBI was made fully aware of his email hack in 2021. In the four years of the Biden administration, Bolton said, no charges were filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  “Then came Trump 2 who embodies what Joseph Stalin’s head of secret police once said, ‘You show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime,’” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” he added. “Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom. I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, was at the White House, doing a press event on  IVF drug prices  when the indictment was handed up.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said when told of the indictment. “Yeah, he’s a bad guy, too bad, but that’s the way it goes, right?”\n \n\n   \n    Investigation began during Biden years\n \n\n   \n  While the first Trump Justice Department had initially sought to block Bolton’s 2020 memoir and investigated whether Bolton violated the law by including information the administration said was classified, that case was closed in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an Iran hack investigation started in 2021 under Biden that brought things to the current point.\n \n\n   \n  For prosecutors and FBI investigators, part of their effort has focused on keeping the case out of the roiling politics looming over the Justice Department as Trump has publicly pushed for the prosecution of his political enemies, which includes Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next for Bolton?\n \n\n   \n  The charges — if proven — are possibly more serious than those in other high-profile investigations into the mishandling of classified material, such as those related to Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Joe Biden and Trump, said CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton is alleged to have “actively disseminated” classified information of the “highest level” to family members who had no security clearance. And when Bolton’s email was hacked by Iran, he allegedly omitted that he had been using the email account to share such information.\n \n\n   \n  “If DOJ can prove this, this is big, big trouble for John Bolton,” Honig said.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been assigned to US District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama in 2014.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Donald Judd and Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/europe/us-russia-budapest-talks-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:03:00-04:00","title":"Will Putin’s call lure Trump closer to the Kremlin?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a nearly two-and-a-half-hour phone call with President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to prevent the U.S. from supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could target Russian cities.

Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Timing in diplomacy is everything, and the Kremlin seems to have timed its latest,  lengthy phone call  with the White House – the eighth in the past eight months – to perfection.\n \n\n   \n  With US President Donald Trump poised to meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, and publicly weighing the risks of supplying Kyiv with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, Russian officials described the call they initiated as “positive and productive,” and “held in an atmosphere of trust.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it was a nearly two-and-a-half-hour intervention by President Vladimir Putin – a last-minute bid to halt in its tracks all that dangerous talk of potentially game-changing US weapons supplies to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield, Putin is said to have stressed on the Trump call. They would just damage the US-Russian relationship, he added, which he knows Trump values so highly.\n \n\n   \n  According to one Kremlin aide, Putin also praised Trump as a peacemaker in the Middle East and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Economic deals were again dangled, and – crucially – there was an agreement for a second face-to-face presidential summit, this time in Budapest, Hungary, where ending the Ukraine war could once more be discussed, if not agreed.\n \n\n   \n  That will raise inevitable comparisons with the failed  Alaska summit  just a few months ago, when Trump gave Putin a red-carpet reception but secured no tangible results in his push for a Ukraine peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  But now, flushed with his achievements in  brokering a ceasefire in Gaza , and the release of Israeli hostages, Trump has suggested that his success in the Middle East, against the odds, will help end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  How remains unclear. The Kremlin has offered no suggestion that it is prepared to compromise. Despite mounting battlefield casualties and increasing Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure, causing fuel shortages across the country, Russia has consistently ruled out ending the war in Ukraine until it has achieved its maximalist objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include gaining control over vast swathes of annexed Ukrainian territory not yet conquered, and imposing strict military and foreign policy limits on a postwar Ukraine that would essentially subjugate Kyiv to Moscow’s will.\n \n\n   \n  Nothing in the latest Trump-Putin phone call suggested any of this had changed.\n \n\n   \n  But over the past nine months of this second Trump administration, the Kremlin has also learned that offering personal engagement, and holding out the possibility of a short-term win, can be just as effective as any painful compromise.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials, gathering in Washington, say it is the discussion of Tomahawks that forced Putin back into dialogue.\n \n\n   \n  That may be true. But the calculation here in Moscow is that the mere prospect of progress on peace talks may be enough to lure Trump, hungry for a deal, into dropping his military threats.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/susan-stamberg-death-npr-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-20:00","title":"Susan Stamberg, first woman to host a national news program, dies at age 87","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Susan Stamberg, the first woman to host a national news program on National Public Radio (NPR), has died at the age of 87.

It did not provide a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg joined NPR in the early 1970s when it was getting off the ground as a network of radio stations across the country. During her career, she interviewed thousands of people, from prominent politicians and artists to the less well-known like White House chefs and people who work behind the scenes in Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  She explained in an oral history interview with Oregon station KLCC in January that she didn’t have women in broadcast to model herself after when she became the host of “All Things Considered” in 1972.\n \n\n   \n  “The only ones on were men, and the only thing I knew to do was imitate them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She lowered her voice to sound authoritative. After a few days, Bill Siemering, the program manager, told her to be herself.\n \n\n   \n  “And that was new too in its day, because everybody else, the women, were trained actors, and so they came with a very careful accents and very careful delivery. They weren’t relaxed and natural,” she said. “So we made a new sound with radio as well, with NPR.”\n \n\n   \n   NPR’s obituary for Stamberg  quoted her colleague Jack Mitchell saying she had an “obvious New York accent.”\n \n\n   \n  “All Things Considered” only had five reporters to draw on while they filled their 90-minute program, creating a daily challenge.\n \n\n   \n  She told KLCC that she coined the term “founding mother” to refer to herself and three other women who helped launch the NPR: Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and Linda Wertheimer.\n \n\n   \n  “I got tired of hearing about Founding Fathers, and I knew we were not that, so we were obviously Founding Mothers, and I was going to put that on the map,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg hosted “All Things Considered” for 14 years. She went on to host “Weekend Edition Sunday,” where she started the Sunday puzzle feature with Will Shortz.\n \n\n   \n  Shortz, who continues to serve as the program’s puzzle master and who is now the crossword editor of the New York Times, explained that Stamberg wanted the show to be the radio equivalent of a Sunday newspaper that provided news, culture, sports and a puzzle.\n \n\n   \n  She later became a cultural correspondent for “Morning Edition” and “Weekend Edition Saturday.” She retired in September.\n \n\n   \n  In 1979, she hosted a two-hour radio call-in program with then-President Jimmy Carter from the Oval Office. She managed the listeners who called in to speak with him. The questions were not screened beforehand. It was the second time Carter had a call-in program after the first with Walter Cronkite.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, which said she was known for her “conversational style, intelligence, and knack for finding an interesting story.” She interviewed Nancy Reagan, Annie Liebowitz, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin, among thousands of others.\n \n\n   \n  She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was born Susan Levitt in Newark, New Jersey, in 1938 but grew up in Manhattan.

16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday announced an agreement to sell common fertility drugs at steeply reduced prices on TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer drug platform the White House plans to launch in January 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Under the plan, cost to patients for three in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs made by EMD Serono, the US arm of German company Merck KGaA, could be reduced by more than 70%, Trump and administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The drugs, sold under the brand names Gonal-F, Ovidrel and Cetrotide, currently typically cost $5,000 per IVF cycle, the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “As part of this agreement, EMD Serono will list their fertility drugs online at TrumpRx.gov at very, very heavily reduced prices — prices that you won’t even believe,” Trump said, calling the company the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by officials including Dr. Mehmet Oz, his Medicare and Medicaid administrator, and Republican Alabama Sen. Katie Britt,   Trump also previewed a plan to spur employers to offer more IVF coverage to their employees.\n \n\n   \n  The actions come approximately eight months after Trump’s promise, in a February executive order, to  expand access to IVF  and reduce its cost.\n \n\n   \n   Pfizer  and  AstraZeneca  also signed   agreements in recent weeks with the administration to offer drugs on TrumpRx as part of multipart deals earning reprieves from higher tariffs on imported products.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the EMD Serono deal would include a reprieve from certain tariffs in exchange for manufacturing and research investment in the US. “We are committed to working with the US administration to add value over the long term, ensuring that our patients and customers continue to have access to and benefit from the innovations within our portfolio,” Belén Garijo, the Merck KGaA CEO, said.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials also noted in a call with reporters that the manufacturer is interested in bringing another fertility medicine to the US market, and could get a speedier review from the Food and Drug Administration as a result of the drug pricing deal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he is encouraging employers to improve IVF access through health insurance plans that offer elective add-on insurance—akin to vision or dental plans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no deeper happiness and joy of raising children, and now millions of Americans struggling with infertility will have a new chance to share the greatest experience of them all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers are not being compelled to offer IVF coverage, nor will there be a requirement for government or insurance company coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The insurance announcement falls well short of a campaign promise Trump made to ensure universal free IVF coverage for those seeking it. “Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” he told supporters at a campaign stop last August.\n \n\n   \n  IVF involves costs beyond drugs and can average between $20,000 and $30,000 per treatment   cycle.  Nearly half of companies  with 500 or more employees covered IVF in their broadest health care plans in 2024, according to a Mercer survey— more than double the number of similar-sized companies that covered IVF in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  However,   smaller companies—those with fewer than 500 employees—are far less likely to offer the benefit,  according to data  from health research nonprofit KFF.\n \n\n   \n  An administration official said they expect employers will want to add on IVF   benefits being proposed by the White House   because it will make them “competitive for talent.”\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 60% of women aged 30 to 44 get their health insurance through their employer, “making this the greatest possible expansion opportunity from a federal action probably ever,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    Limits to Trump’s IVF plans\n \n\n   \n  In response to the announcement, some reproductive medicine doctors and advocates questioned how extensive new insurance coverage would be and what the impact would be on other widely used fertility drugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Fertility care, including IVF, is health care,” said Dr. Serena Chen, director of advocacy at CCRM Fertility IRMS Reproductive Medicine in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to hear a federal mandate for insurance coverage” for IVF, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was cautiously hopeful about the White House’s promised 84% discount on the three fertility drugs from EMD Serono, noting the company is one of three major makers of commonly used fertility medicines.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously that’s a massive discount, so that I do think is super exciting,” she said. However, she noted that two other companies, Organon and Ferring, are also key makers of these drugs. “What about the other two companies?”\n \n\n   \n  Organon and Ferring did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the other companies in the market make some — but not necessarily all three — of the fertility medicines used in the IVF process, said Dr. David Sable, a former reproductive endocrinologist and current biosciences fund manager. That could make EMD Serono’s agreement with the Trump administration, to offer a heavy discount on their three products together, hard to rival, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet other moves by the Trump administration could hurt families’ access to successful IVF procedures, Sable has argued. In particular, layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this April eliminated a  six-person team  that tracks assisted fertility procedures and potential factors in successful pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  “If you mandate coverage or make IVF free tomorrow, you need an infrastructure and an ecosystem that actually can take care of all these patients,” Sable said. “We need innovation, we need automation, we need risk management.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/us-strikes-suspected-drug-boat-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-04:00","title":"Some survivors after US strikes another suspected drug boat in the Caribbean, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 16, 2025, the United States conducted a strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean, resulting in survivors on board — a first in a series of six prior strikes, where all on board had previously been killed.

the first general election debate in the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani was pushed to provide specifics about his plans if he’s elected mayor of New York City in the campaign’s first fall debate, hammered by his two older rivals who painted him as unprepared and accused him of selling the city’s residents a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the two hours on stage centered on Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and clear front-runner in the polls. But there were so many back-and-forths that Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, started an answer just 15 minutes into the event by saying: “First of all, there’s high levels of testosterone in this room.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t answer exactly how he would afford his signature policies of  freezing increases on rent-controlled apartments  and making buses free, or how to square  past comments on the police  that he says don’t represent his current views. And he notably declined to back the reelection bid of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul,  one of the few major Democrats  in the state to endorse him.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent  after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary , said Mamdani’s “whole plan is based on a myth” of believing that Albany would pass new taxes to enable his plans. Sliwa called his ideas “fantasies.” But Cuomo had his own struggles to explain what new ideas he would bring to City Hall or the questions about  sexual harassment  and  his handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes  that followed him when he resigned as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity,” Mamdani told Cuomo early on. “What you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.”\n \n\n   \n  Here are CNN’s main takeaways from the debate.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo says if Mamdani wins, NYC’s leader would be ‘Mayor Donald Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo traded familiar barbs about the Queens native in the White House. But Cuomo debuted a new line to reflect his belief that President Donald Trump would overpower Mamdani and undermine his authority.\n \n\n   \n  “If the assemblyman is elected, Mayor Donald Trump will take over in New York City, and it will be Mayor Trump,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded by accusing Cuomo of being a “coward.” He noted Cuomo  failed to mention Trump  in a statement he issued condemning the Department of Justice’s indictment of State Attorney General Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa were all asked the last time they spoke with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said he spoke with the president after an assassination attempt last year and again denied a New York Times report that the two had recently spoken about the mayoral race. Sliwa said he hadn’t spoken with Trump in years, saying he had last spoken with Trump years ago about the Veterans Day parade.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if he had ever spoken with Trump, Mamdani answered with a curt “no.” (He did  turn to a Fox News camera  Wednesday to deliver a message directly to Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was asked what he would say to Trump in a hypothetical first call if elected mayor. He said he would be willing to speak and work with the president as long as it was focused on issues of affordability.\n \n\n   \n   “I would make it clear to the president that I am willing to not only speak to him, but to work with him if it means delivering on lowering the cost of living for New York,” Mamdani said. “That’s something that he ran his presidential campaign on, and yet, all he’s been able to deliver thus far.”\n \n\n   \n    Israel and Gaza\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a Democratic sensation and as  the party’s politics have broadly shifted against the Israeli government  during the war in Gaza, Mamdani has proactively repeated the opposition to Israel he expressed consistently from college through his time as an assemblyman.\n \n\n   \n  On the debate stage, Mamdani spoke of  the conversations he has had with Jewish New Yorkers  since becoming the Democratic nominee that have opened his eyes to the existence of antisemitism in ways he said he hadn’t fully realized existed and how the phrase “globalize the intifada” could be hurtful. He wouldn’t say whether he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying only that he does not support any country that exists with racial or religious hierarchies.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani also backtracked on an answer he gave just Wednesday on Fox News. Pressed then about whether he would call for Hamas to lay down their weapons, as is called for in the ceasefire agreement, Mamdani said he didn’t have an opinion on the matter beyond following international law. On the debate stage, he did have an opinion: “Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t respond when Cuomo tried to make a moment of calling on him to denounce Hamas explicitly. He said while he hopes the ceasefire will hold, he will not stop denouncing “the siege, the occupation, and apartheid.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo leapt on that answer, arguing that “the occupation” is a reference to Israel existing at all on the land and saying it’s equivalent to the Hamas-promoted slogan that a future Palestinian state should be “from the river to the sea.” Mamdani rejected that interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani in turn accused Cuomo of fanning anti-Muslim sentiment, arguing that Cuomo never visited a mosque until after losing the primary to him.\n \n\n   \n  “What Muslims want in this city is what every community wants and deserves,” he said. “They want equality and they want respect.”\n \n\n   \n    The forgotten Republican tries to make a mark\n \n\n   \n  The Republican nominee came out swinging.\n \n\n   \n  Free of his  signature red beret , Sliwa leaned into the center-stage spot given to him to go after both of his opponents. He sought to separate himself from the political establishment, at one point countering a question about his lack of political experience by saying, “Thank God I am not a politician.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, best known as the founder of the crime watch group Guardian Angels, focused many of his attacks on Cuomo, questioning his toughness and at one point invoking his father with a particularly sharp zinger.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa alleged that the state parole board when Cuomo was governor released people accused of killing police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “Your father, when he was governor, released none. I knew Mario Cuomo; you’re no Mario Cuomo,” Sliwa said.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is hoping to appeal not just to Republicans but also moderate Democrats unwilling to support Cuomo or Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  He has repeatedly refused to leave the race as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams did, even as Cuomo allies argue Sliwa staying in the race helps Mamdani. Trump has refused to endorse Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa called Mamdani’s ideas “fantasies.” Mamdani generally ignored Sliwa, other than repeatedly correcting the Republican’s mispronunciations of his first name.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani did snap at Sliwa when the Republican told him that “Jews don’t trust that you are going to be there for them when they’re subject to antisemitic attacks.”\n \n\n   \n  “I will be a mayor who finally addresses that, not just the theatrics on this stage,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani again apologizes for ripping the police as racist\n \n\n   \n  Since winning June’s Democratic primary, Mamdani  has distanced himself  from tweets referring to police officers as “racist” and “wicked,” though he has a long history of being critical of law enforcement. He’s also  met with police officers and won a notable endorsement  from a former high-ranking New York Police Department official.\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his apology Thursday to New York Police Department officers but also mentioned the names of Black men who have died in police encounters, including the five young men of color who were wrongfully accused and convicted in the Central Park jogger case in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has tried to draw a contrast between him and Mamdani by proposing to increase the police officer headcount, casting himself as a tough on crime candidate and suggesting Mamdani would be soft.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has proposed creating a Department of Community Safety which would in part dispatch social workers to calls involving people in mental health crises instead of solely relying on police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “He wants to use social workers on domestic violence calls, which are very dangerous, and he’s told you what he thinks,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n    A brewing fight over taxes on millionaires – and a notable non-endorsement\n \n\n   \n  There was a wide range of subjects discussed Thursday that will confront the city’s next mayor, everything from noise complaints to the city’s public school system, the largest in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani said he would be in favor of changing mayoral control over the school system, a surprising position considering it could limit his authority. Mayoral control allows the mayor near-complete authority over the city’s public school system, centralizing the power with the executive which is in turn seen as being directly accountable for the how the system performs.\n \n\n   \n   Mamdani said he would not give up control in full, saying he wants a participatory system that gives parents and educators increased influence.\n \n\n   \n  He also doubled down on his plan to raise taxes the city’s wealthiest residents despite Hochul’s opposition, saying he believed the same energy that buoyed his underdog campaign would create support for his push to increase taxes.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people called even my campaign a nonstarter when we first began,” Mamdani said. “Now I stand before you proud to be the Democratic nominee who got the most votes in city primary history, and I believe we will see the same thing with our push to ensure that we are taxing the wealthiest and the most profitable corporations the fair amount that they should pay.”\n \n\n   \n  As mayor, Mamdani would not have the power to raise taxes on his own. He would need the approval of the state legislature and for the governor to sign off on the increase – a politically difficult proposition for any executive, particularly in an election year, which Hochul will be facing next year.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Mamdani declined to endorse Hochul for reelection, saying he was focused on winning the mayoral race, even as Hochul  became one of the first major New York Democrats  to endorse him for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m focusing on November, and I appreciate her support, and I appreciate her work,” Mamdani said when pressed by a moderator.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/chicago-car-ramming-case-ice-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00Z","title":"Federal Vehicle Moved 1,000 Miles from Chicago in Controversial Ramming Case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a legal case stemming from an alleged car ramming incident in Chicago on October 4, 2025, during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, is accused of colliding with a federal vehicle.

Alexakis agreed and ordered the car to be moved using a flatbed truck.\n \n\n   \n  Another hearing will be held Monday to set a trial date. If convicted at trial, Martinez could face up to twenty years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to Bond.\n \n\n   \n  The other driver, 21-year-old Ruiz, was indicted on the same charge as Martinez and has pleaded not guilty.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, who captivated audiences with his elaborate galactic makeup and smoking guitar, died Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  He was 74.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, according to his agent.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said in a statement that they are “completely devastated and heartbroken” but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss, whose hits included “Rock and Roll All Nite” and “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” was known for its theatrical stage shows, with fire and fake blood spewing from the mouths of band members dressed in body armor, platform boots, wigs and signature black-and-white face paint.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss’ original lineup included Frehley, singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, tongue-wagging bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss. Frehley’s is the first death among the four founding members.\n \n\n   \n  Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters – Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and the “Spaceman.” The New York-born entertainer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.\n \n\n   \n  “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” Simmons and Stanley said in a joint statement. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS’s legacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Born Paul Daniel Frehley, he grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at age 13. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss was especially popular in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to become a marketing marvel. “Beth” was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.\n \n\n   \n  As the Kennedy Center’s new chairman, President Donald Trump named Kiss as one of  this year’s honorees .\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the band sold their catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be over $300 million.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years. He left the band in 1982, missing the years when they took off the makeup and had mixed success. Stanley later said they nearly replaced Frehley with Eddie Van Halen, but Vinnie Vincent assumed the lead guitar role.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley’s Comet.\n \n\n   \n  But he rejoined Kiss in the mid-1990s for a triumphant reunion and restoration of their original style that came after bands including Nirvana, Weezer and the Melvins had expressed affection for the band and paid them musical tributes.\n \n\n   \n  He would leave again in 2002. When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.\n \n\n   \n  Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss “no longer deserve to wear the paint.” “The makeup is earned,” he added. “Just being there at the beginning is not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands including Mötley Crüe and Poison.\n \n\n   \n  “Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we’ve done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,” Poison front man  Bret Michaels  said on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  Harder-edged bands like Metallica and Pantera were also fans, and even country superstar Garth Brooks joined the band members for a recording of their “Hard Luck Woman” on a 1994 compilation.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley would appear occasionally with Kiss for shows in later years. A 2023 concert at Madison Square Garden was  billed as the band’s last.  While Stanley and Simmons said they would not tour again, they’ve been open to the possibility of more concerts, and they’ve stayed active promoting the group’s music and memorabilia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/virginia-attorney-general-debate-jay-jones-jason-miyares","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"20:48:00-04:00","title":"Jay Jones’ Violent Text Messages Take Center Stage in Virginia AG Race Debate Against Jason Miyares","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a heated debate ahead of the Virginia attorney general election, Democratic nominee Jay Jones faced intense scrutiny over graphic and violent text messages he sent in 2022 to then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, in which he suggested Gilbert and his wife were 'breeding little fascists' and that their children should die.

Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:48 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general, expressed his regret for the graphic and violent language directed at a colleague  in text messages  in his opening statement in Thursday night’s debate with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be very clear: I am ashamed. I am embarrassed. And I am sorry,” Jones said. “I am sorry to Speaker Gilbert. I am sorry to his family. I am sorry to my family. And I am sorry to every single Virginian. I cannot take back what I said, but you have my word that I will always be accountable for my mistakes. And you also have my word that I will spend every waking moment fighting for you.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate came less than two weeks after the attorney general’s race was turned on its head by the publication of the 2022 text messages in which Jones, then a state legislator, suggested then- House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican, should be shot. He went on to say Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists,” in reference to Gilbert’s young children and suggested the children should die. National Review  first reported  the news of Jones’ texts, which were sent to a Republican lawmaker, Carrie Coyner.\n \n\n   \n  Jones’ comments happened moments after Miyares recounted the contents of those text messages, and said they reveal Jones does not have the “experience or the judgment” to be the state’s top prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen a window to who Jay Jones is and the way he thinks of people that disagree with him,” Miyares said. “Abraham Lincoln said the character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he was doing in the dark.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the debate, Miyares kept a relentless focus on Jones’ text messages — repeatedly invoking their contents to cast doubt on whether he could prosecute crimes against children, deal with parents whose children have died and more.\n \n\n   \n  “Jay, if you were really sorry, then you wouldn’t be running,” Miyares said during the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, meanwhile, sought to redirect the conversation to President Donald Trump, arguing that Miyares couldn’t be trusted to defend Virginians’ interests by taking on the Trump administration in court.\n \n\n   \n  “It is no surprise that President Trump has endorsed Jason for this race — the only statewide elected official to receive that endorsement,” Jones said. “Threw his arm around him and said, ‘He will never let you down.’ And when he says ‘you’ he means Donald Trump, because Donald Trump has spent the last 10 years telling us that he only cares about himself.”\n \n\n   \n  Early voting is already underway. Under Virginia law, there is no way for Jones to formally exit the race at this point without Democrats effectively conceding the attorney general’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, has denounced Jones’ texts — but has left his political fate up to voters. She did not repeat her previous endorsement of Jones in her  recent debate  with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, but she also did not call for Jones to end his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Jones’ texts have become a national story that has dominated headlines ahead of an election in Virginia that is often seen as a barometer of the political mood a year after each presidential election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday said Jones “has appropriately apologized” for his texts and said his remarks have been “condemned across the board by the Democrats” in Virginia and beyond. He did not say whether Jones should stay in the race or not.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Democratic Party chairman Lamont Bagby, who is a state senator, has defended Jones.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve known Jay Jones for years, and I know his family. I know him as a man, and those texts aren’t who he is. And at this point in the commonwealth’s history, we need somebody that’s going to stand up and fight for Virginia’s health care, education and make sure that we stand up for democracy,” Bagby said.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, could represent Republicans’ best chance of a statewide victory in Virginia this fall. He won the attorney general’s office in 2021, ousting Democratic incumbent Mark Herring — a year in which Jones lost the Democratic primary to Herring. Miyares has often waded into cultural battles over gender identity and schools — an issue that Earle-Sears has made the centerpiece of her message this year.\n \n\n   \n  The debate covered a range of issues that have been focal points in Virginia’s elections — including  utility costs , transgender policies, drug prices, fentanyl prosecutions and the  government shutdown  — which has major ramifications in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, where the federal government is a massive employer. But Miyares also peppered his comments with references to Jones’ texts throughout the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, who was also in the Legislature at the time the texts were sent, recalled Gilbert’s wife bringing their two young children to the General Assembly, and the children running through the halls.\n \n\n   \n  “This wasn’t a hypothetical. This wasn’t some figure that you know from far away. You actually know Todd. This is a flesh-and-blood, real husband. Jennifer is a real mom. These are real kids,” Miyares said. “How in the world could you ever show compassion and comfort a grieving mother that has ever lost a child to violence?”\n \n\n   \n  Jones pointed to Republican figures’ own controversial comments.\n \n\n   \n  “What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones said, referring to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Jones added: “I have taken accountability for my mistakes. It’s time you take accountability, too.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/illinois-judge-trump-chicago-protesters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00-04:00","title":"Federal Judge Demands Answers from Trump Admin on Order to Avoid Violent Encounters with Chicago Protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, has expanded her restraining order against the Trump administration’s use of excessive force during protests related to immigration enforcement, requiring all federal agents in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during encounters with protesters.

 By Andy Rose, Bill Kirkos, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The sign outside the door said Courtroom 1403. But inside, it felt a lot more like the principal’s office.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” US District Judge Sara Ellis said Thursday in a stern tone no student – or attorney – wants to hear. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  One week after the judge issued a  sweeping order  trying to calm the intense response of federal agents to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Border Patrol activities in Chicago, Ellis told both sides to come back to her courtroom to have their own intense discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I live in Chicago, if folks haven’t noticed, and I’m not blind, right?” Ellis opened the hearing. “So, I don’t live in a cave. I have a phone. I have a TV. I have a computer and I tend to get news.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge said those news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration may not be following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” said Ellis  from the bench.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Ellis announced Thursday she will expand her restraining order, requiring all federal agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz and who have body cameras to have them on during encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge initially required all agents to wear cameras, but agreed to some flexibility after Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, said it would be logistically impossible to immediately equip all agents with bodycams.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body cam order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the body cam videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  “It would require a tremendous amount of resources,” Skedzielewski said.\n \n\n   \n    Order limited use of riot control weapons and tactics\n \n\n   \n  Ellis –  an Obama appointee  – issued a temporary restraining order last week after a coalition of local journalists and protesters sued the Trump administration, saying federal law enforcement agents were targeting people engaging in peaceful activity, including multiple reporters who said they had pepper balls fired on them despite being identified as press.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the plaintiffs said they believe agents violated the order, including a  confrontation  on Chicago’s southeast side Tuesday after a traffic accident involving US Border Patrol, which ended with agents using tear gas against an angry crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” said the judge, suggesting the tense situation resulted from Border Patrol agents using tactics not appropriate in the nation’s third-largest city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not on the border. We are in an urban, densely populated area where crowds are going to converge when there’s a commotion, where appropriate crowd control is important,” she said. “Trying to apprehend and detain people is very, very different when you’re in an urban setting than when you’re out on the border.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday at 10:30 a.m. local time, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” It is unclear if Hott will appear in person or via a video link.\n \n\n   \n  The original restraining order from Ellis blocks agents from targeting journalists who are not interfering with law enforcement. Federal agents are also prohibited from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on anyone who does not impose an “immediate threat to safety.”\n \n\n   \n  “The issue is that DHS is using force in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters, journalists and, essentially, clergy members,” said the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t shoot ‘em in the head (with pepper balls),” Ellis said, addressing a list of things federal agents have been accused of doing in encounters with demonstrators. “You can’t deploy tear gas. You can’t use flash-bang grenades. You can’t drive a car through a crowd.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of a pastor being  repeatedly shot  by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago earlier this month drew widespread outcry.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration agents nationally have expressed reluctance about body cameras\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys on both sides of the Chicago case are waiting for details on how the body camera order will work there. The topic has at times led to friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts across the country, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras expressed concern to their FBI counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said. During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, law enforcement sources said the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed by immigration agents have, at times, led to other confrontations in recent months between the Department of Homeland Security and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.\n \n\n   \n  In at least two FBI field office divisions, sources who were not authorized to speak publicly said agents assigned to work on immigration matters raised concerns with their management over what they believed to be questionable tactics by DHS, such as entering private property without permission and racial profiling.\n \n\n   \n    Government says judge is seeing “selectively edited” reports\n \n\n   \n  Skedzielewski suggested the news coverage that prompted the judge’s anger may be misleading, saying Ellis is relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis acknowledged some details in news reports may be under dispute, adding that is why she wants to speak to the field director on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker – who is not a party to the lawsuit – said Thursday he was pleased by the judge’s decision to expand her order and that agents should be wearing body cameras “because they clearly lie about what goes on.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re going to see more cases brought against ICE and (Customs and Border Protection),” Pritzer added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked recently about tactics used by immigration agents, DHS said  in a statement  to CNN that federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/read-john-bolton-full-indictment","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00Z","title":"Full indictment of John Bolton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on 18 counts, including eight for transmitting and ten for retaining classified national defense information.

However, it would not be the first time Trump or members of his cabinet have sought to see a change in leadership in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  During his first term, Trump  recognized  Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the president of Venezuela after Maduro was inaugurated for a second term that the US, dozens of other countries, and the Venezuelan opposition had decried as illegitimate.\n \n\n   \n  The January 2019 recognition set off a rapid diplomatic breakdown between Washington and Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro, accusing the US of backing a coup, cut diplomatic ties with the administration,  closed  Venezuela’s embassy and all of its consulates in the United States, and issued an ultimatum for US personnel to leave Venezuela. Hours later, the US State Department ordered all of its non-emergency diplomats out of the country. Less than two months later, the US  withdrew  the rest of its diplomats and suspended operations at its embassy in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  The administration imposed a flurry of sanctions on the Maduro regime during the first term. In 2020, Trump’s Justice Department charged Maduro was engaging in “narco-terrorism” and levied a $15 million bounty for the arrest of the Venezuelan leader.\n \n\n   \n  In January 2019, then-national security adviser John Bolton said that “all options” were on the table, including military force.\n \n\n   \n  Now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the key architect of the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy, has long denounced the Maduro regime and backed the Venezuelan opposition.\n \n\n   \n  In April 2019, during his time as a Florida senator, Rubio called the Maduro government “a transnational criminal group” and said “the crisis” in the country wasn’t “an attempt to bring about ‘regime change’ or interfere in the internal affairs of another country,” but rather about “serious threats to our national security posed by drug trafficking” and Russian and Iranian influence.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro and “his cronies aren’t politicians motivated by the national interests of a country, they are gangsters motivated by a desire to keep their illegal sources of income,” Rubio  posted  on X at the time. “We must consider every option available to us to bring to an end their lucrative criminal activities.”\n \n\n   \n  More than six years later, much appears the same.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has remained in power, once again claiming victory in an election in 2024 denounced by the international community as illegitimate.\n \n\n   \n  Although there has been limited engagement between Maduro’s and Trump’s governments, formal diplomatic ties remain severed.\n \n\n   \n  However, the threat of military force is far more present. The Trump administration has said its strategy is one of countering narco-trafficking, but some officials have acknowledged that it could also serve as a means to dislodge Maduro from power.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean and carried out deadly military strikes on at least five alleged drug boats with ties to cartels and criminal organizations the administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has increased the bounty on Maduro to $50 million.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump confirmed he had authorized the CIA to operate inside of Venezuela, but he said it was to counter drug smuggling.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump believes that Nicholas Maduro is an illegitimate President leading an illegitimate regime that has been trafficking drugs to the United States of America for far too long, and we’re not going to tolerate it,” White House press secretary Karoline Levitt said Thursday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/11/entertainment/diane-keaton-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"Diane Keaton, ‘La-Dee-Da’ dame of Hollywood, dead at 79","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Keaton, a celebrated Hollywood actress known for her comedic timing, unique fashion sense, and dramatic versatility, has died at the age of 79 from bacterial pneumonia.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Diane Keaton , known for her unique brand of comedic timing and inimitable style, has died. Stars from Goldie Hawn to Bette Midler to Steve Martin expressed their love of the actor after hearing the news, paying tribute to “just a truly original person,” as Reese Witherspoon put it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to believe,” said Jane Fonda in a tribute.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was 79, and her cause of her death was  later revealed  to be from bacterial pneumonia, according to a death certificate obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told CNN that they received a call for medical assistance on Saturday morning at Keaton’s address and paramedics transferred a person to a hospital. A law enforcement source confirmed the person transported was Keaton.\n \n\n   \n   Keaton  was a celebrated and prolific actor whose career spanned decades, early on earning an Academy Award in the best actress category for 1977’s “Annie Hall.” The film showcased Keaton’s abilities in the realm of comedy but also displayed her nimble handling of authentic and vulnerable moments.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, “Annie Hall” introduced filmgoers to Keaton’s matchless and gender-nonconforming sense of style – immediately identifiable by her use of men’s slacks, vests and hats. Decidedly ahead of her time from a fashion perspective, Keaton maintained a commitment to this sartorial mix well into her older years.\n \n\n   \n  An undeniable comedic talent who said in 1997 that she’s “more inclined to live comfortably in the world of humor,” Keaton nonetheless also made her mark in a number of dramatic movies – including a pivotal role in Francis Ford Coppola’s acclaimed “Godfather” films, in which she played Kay, wife to Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone.\n \n\n   \n    Starting out\n \n\n   \n  Keaton, who bore no relation to Buster or Michael, was born Diane Hall in 1946 in Los Angeles. In a 2004 “Fresh Air” podcast, she talked about how her mother, a homemaker and amateur photographer, won pageants and became Mrs. Highland Park and later Mrs. Los Angeles, which first gave her the urge to perform.\n \n\n   \n  “I did want to go on stage, I saw that that was something that did appeal to me,” she said. “There she was in the theater, and I saw the curtain open and there was my mother, and I thought, ‘Hm, I think I’d like that for myself.’”\n \n\n   \n  After finding her place on the theater stage in the late 1960s in a Broadway production of “Hair” – in which she gained some notoriety for declining to perform nude for one of the musical numbers and thereby forewent a sizable (at the time) $50 bonus – Keaton burst onto the film scene with the first “Godfather” film in 1972, going on to appear in several films throughout the decade opposite the writer and director Woody Allen, who was also her romantic partner around that time.\n \n\n   \n  The films they acted in together include Allen’s “Sleeper” and “Play It Again Sam,” but it was her star turn in “Annie Hall,” in which she played the joyous and carefree titular character who falls in love with Allen’s bumbling, self-hating comedian, that would prove most memorable.\n \n\n   \n    Leading lady\n \n\n   \n  From there, Keaton enjoyed leading star-status in a fair share of notable films, including 1977’s “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” and 1981’s “Reds” opposite Warren Beatty, a film that scored multiple Oscar nods including another one for her.\n \n\n   \n  Another classic film starring Keaton from the ’80s era was 1987’s “Baby Boom,” which featured her as a high-powered ad exec who suddenly finds herself saddled with the infant of a dead long-lost relative. The fish-out-of-water comedy costarred Sam Shepard and reminded audiences of Keaton’s deft skills at leading a movie that mixed the funny with the dramatic and thought-provoking.\n \n\n   \n  The 1990s saw Keaton team up with her contemporary Hollywood powerhouses Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn for the hit 1996 comedy “First Wives Club,” about a trio of women who exact artful revenge on their husbands after the men leave them for younger women. Raking in $181 million at the domestic box office, “First Wives” was welcome proof that a successful film didn’t exclusively have to include explosions or aliens, and could even be led by three women in their 50s.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the decade, Keaton earned a third Oscar nom for the tearjerker “Marvin’s Room,” in which she starred opposite Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film tells the story of an estranged pair of sisters who reunite to grapple with their past as well as the onset of illness.\n \n\n   \n    Far from slowing down\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was featured in several more acclaimed movies in the aughts – including the 2003 rom-com “Something’s Gotta Give” opposite Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves, in which she scored her fourth lead actor Academy Award nod – as well as “The Family Stone” from 2005, a modern-day Christmas classic with Keaton in the role of a matriarch who unwittingly helps her children find the partners they belong with.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, she appeared in “Book Club” in 2018, alongside Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen, as well as its 2023 sequel.\n \n\n   \n  She also starred in the comedy “Summer Camp” alongside Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard last year and had a few titles in the works – including a film with Blake Lively and Richard Gere, according to her IMDb.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was also an accomplished producer and director. She helmed the acclaimed 1995 drama “Unstrung Heroes” starring Andie MacDowell, as well as “Hanging Up” in 2000. Her producing credits span over 30 years, with the most recent being an executive producer credit on 2023’s “Maybe I Do,” which starred Keaton, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Emma Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Unapologetically independent\n \n\n   \n  Keaton never married, and had been outspoken about her thinking on the topic, saying it goes back to her mother, as “most everything does.”\n \n\n   \n  “She had four kids, and I was the firstborn. I saw how much she gave up,” Keaton said in a 2021 piece for Interview. “I feel like she chose family over her dreams. And she was just the best mother, but I think that she is the reason why I didn’t get married. I didn’t want to give up my independence.”\n \n\n   \n  With her trademark humor, Keaton added, “By the way, no one has ever asked me to marry them, either, so that might be a good answer. I should’ve started with that and called it a day.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton is survived by her two children, daughter Dexter, and son Duke. She adopted them both in her 50s.\n \n\n   \n  “The shocking thing is that I worry differently now,” Keaton told Life Magazine in 2005 about how motherhood changed her. “Before kids, if I worried, it was only about myself, but that’s all you do is worry as a parent. It’s rule number one in parenting: secretly worry without letting the kids know you’re worried.”\n \n\n   \n  When she was 69, Keaton told AARP Magazine, “At this age, everything seems much more astonishing. Like, Oh my goodness, look at that sycamore tree! Why didn’t I see that before? There’s a magical aspect, a wonder, to being on this planet.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton’s death was first reported by People magazine. CNN has reached out to her representatives, who have not replied. Producer Dori Rath, who worked with Keaton, confirmed the actress had died to CNN on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/entertainment/diane-keaton-cause-of-death-certificate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"New details released about the death of Diane Keaton","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Keaton, the acclaimed actress and Academy Award winner for 'Annie Hall,' died at age 79 on Saturday from primary bacterial pneumonia, with no other contributing conditions.

   5:37 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US President  Donald Trump  said Thursday that he would meet with Russian President  Vladimir Putin  in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss the war in Ukraine after the two men had a lengthy phone call that Trump described as “very productive.”\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this ‘inglorious’ War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. President Zelenskyy and I will be meeting tomorrow, in the Oval Office, where we will discuss my conversation with President Putin, and much more,” the president said on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  The call between the two world leaders lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours and was held at the request of Russia, according to a Kremlin aide. It appeared to quickly shift Trump’s tone toward Russia, which has bucked his efforts to end the war. Trump later told reporters during an Oval Office event that he would meet with Putin “within two weeks or so.”\n \n\n   \n  He also noted in his social media post that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead a delegation of high-level advisors to meet with Russian officials next week, with a location to be determined, and then provided additional details to reporters later in the afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  “Marco Rubio is going to be meeting with his counterpart, as you know, (Russian Foreign Minister Sergey) Lavrov, and they’ll be meeting pretty soon. They’re going to set up a time and a place, very shortly, maybe it’s already set up. They’ve already spoken,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Putin immediately supported Trump’s idea of a planned summit in Budapest to discuss ending the Ukraine war, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said, describing the call between the two leaders as “highly informative and extremely frank.”\n \n\n   \n  The plans come more than two months after Trump held his last in-person  summit with Putin  in Anchorage, Alaska.\n \n\n   \n  Budapest was a finalist for to host that meeting before officials ultimately landed on Alaska, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has maintained a close relationship with Putin and Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are underway,” Orban announced on Thursday afternoon following a call with Tru﻿mp.\n \n\n   \n  “Hungary is the island of PEACE!” he posted on X.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A very good and productive call’\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in his post on social media that he believes “great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation” with Putin and noted a number of topics of discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine,” the president wrote in his social media post. “We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over.”\n \n\n   \n  Putin also thanked first lady Melania Trump during the call for her advocacy for children, Trump said. “He was very appreciative, and said that this will continue,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady  announced last week  that Russia had allowed eight Ukrainian children to reunite with their parents, following months of private discussions between Russian officials and the first lady’s office centered on children separated from their families during the war.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed for more information after the conclusion of the call, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the administration would provide “more details as soon as we can.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was just talking with the president and the secretary of state and the vice president, and it was a very good and productive call. It lasted more than two hours,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has flashed frustration in recent weeks as Putin has continued the war in Ukraine. But Trump has shown little willingness to push for US-led measures that would punish the Kremlin.\n \n\n   \n  During the Oval Office event, Trump was asked about Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s plans for the chamber to soon take up sanctions legislation aimed at punishing Russia for its war against Ukraine. He suggested that it “may not be perfect timing” to pass the bipartisan measure, which has been held up for months as congressional leaders have deferred to the president’s desire to hold off on sanctions and pursue diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  “This may be such a productive call that we’re going to end up, we want to get peace. We want to stop the killing,” Trump said. “So I’m going to speak to him and the Speaker Mike Johnson. I’ll speak to them a little bit later, and I’ll tell them about this, and we’ll make the right determination. I’m not against anything. I’m just saying, it may not be perfect timing.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump and Zelensky to meet Friday\n \n\n   \n  The Trump-Putin call comes ahead of a meeting between the US leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Zelensky told a group of journalists in Kyiv that the main topics of his conversation with the president at the White House will include “air defense and our possibilities with long-range (missiles to put) pressure on Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently floated the possibility of giving Ukraine Tomahawk cruise missiles unless Russia dramatically changes its negotiating posture – a suggestion Zelensky pointed to as he announced his arrival in Washington, DC, on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Tomorrow, a meeting with President Trump is scheduled – and we expect that the momentum of curbing terror and war that succeeded in the Middle East will help to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Zelensky said on X. “The language of strength and justice will inevitably work against Russia as well. We can already see that Moscow is rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin said Trump had told Putin that he would “take into account” Moscow’s concerns about American Tomahawks being supplied to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  In Thursday’s call, Putin repeated his longstanding view that “the Tomahawks would not change the situation on the battlefield, but that all of this would cause significant damage to relations between our countries, not to mention the prospects for a peaceful resolution,” Ushakov said during a Kremlin briefing.\n \n\n   \n  Ushakov added that Trump “also said that during his contact with Zelensky, he would, of course, take into account the considerations expressed by the president of Russia during today’s telephone conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  The president then confirmed in the Oval Office that the two leaders “talked about” the Tomahawk missiles for “a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  “l, we talked about it a little bit. Didn’t say much, but I do say to you, you know, we need tomahawks for the United States of America, too,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/middleeast/hostage-bodies-israel-hamas-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Netanyahu says ‘struggle is not over’ as dispute with Hamas over hostage bodies continues","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists the struggle against Hamas is far from over, despite a ceasefire agreement that saw the release of 20 living hostages and only nine of 28 deceased hostages.

  \nUpdated: \n        5:20 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday the country’s “struggle is not over,” just days after Israel and Hamas agreed to a  ceasefire deal  that has since been blighted by a dispute over the return of deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Hamas released the 20 remaining living hostages as part of the ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. Israel also released more than 1,700 Palestinian detainees it had been holding without charge, as well as 250 Palestinian prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  But in Israel, some of the  relief felt in the wake of the agreement  has been eclipsed by anger that Hamas so far has released only the remains of nine of the 28 deceased hostages held in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  In an address Thursday to commemorate fallen Israeli soldiers and mark the anniversary — under the Hebrew calendar — of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack, Netanyahu vowed that Israel will “achieve all the goals of this war.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl cemetery, Netanyahu declared: “The struggle is not over, but one thing is clear today: Anyone who raises his hand against us already knows that he will pay a very heavy price for his aggression. We are determined to complete the victory, a victory that will shape the course of our lives for many years.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ military wing said Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages in Gaza. In a statement, Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades said the group has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n  But  Israel believes  that Hamas knows the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. One of the sources said Israel believes that Hamas has access to at least six other bodies and possibly more. The source said Israel knows that five of the bodies “have disappeared,” while there is an ongoing dispute with Hamas about several other bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Israel and Hamas had agreed on a mechanism for searching for the remains of bodies whose whereabouts are unknown, but that mechanism has not begun operating.\n \n\n   \n  The United States does not believe that Hamas is violating its commitments to the agreement by failing to produce the bodies, two senior US advisers told CNN on Wednesday. The advisers said they received assurances from Hamas, via third-party mediators, that the group would do everything possible to return the remaining bodies.\n \n\n   \n  The US is actively working through mediators to provide intelligence and logistical support to locate the remaining bodies, which in many cases could be buried under rubble and debris. Large swaths of Gaza have been flattened by Israeli bombardment, and roughly 92% of housing in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged, according to the  latest United Nations figures  released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  An Israeli official told CNN that Israel has shared information, based on its intelligence, on the location of some of the bodies of deceased hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The US advisers also told CNN that other countries have offered help, including Turkey, which has proposed sending a team of body-retrieval specialists with expertise in locating remains left behind in earthquakes.\n \n\n   \n  The delay in securing the return of all the bodies is souring the elation felt by Israelis on Monday, when all 20 remaining living hostages came home.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that the ceasefire deal “cannot continue to be implemented without Hamas returning all the hostages.” The group demanded that Hamas “fulfill its obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Any decision that weakens pressure on Hamas or allows the agreement to continue while hostages remain unreturned would be a grave moral and leadership failure,” the forum’s statement added in an apparent effort to place pressure on the Israeli government as well. “The job is not done. Our loved ones have not yet come home as promised.”\n \n\n   \n    Aid restrictions\n \n\n   \n  After threatening to restrict humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to pressure Hamas to release more bodies, Israel appears to have backed down and is now allowing quantities of aid into the enclave in line with the amounts required under the ceasefire agreement, US and Israeli officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A tally from Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), obtained by CNN, showed that more than 700 trucks crossed into Gaza on Wednesday, with fuel and gas among the items moved into the territory. The ceasefire agreement stipulates 600 trucks a day.\n \n\n   \n  A vast majority of the trucks went through the Kerem Shalom crossing near Egypt, while fewer than 100 crossed through Kissufim in central Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to COGAT for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ Government Media Office said 480 humanitarian aid trucks, including three with cooking gas and six with diesel fuel, entered Gaza on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, the UN had expressed concern over threatened restrictions on aid, saying it could not become a bargaining chip.\n \n\n   \n  “Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said Wednesday in a statement on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Netanyahu has yet to declare the war officially over and has avoided the issue of a potential resumption of fighting.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s military still occupies roughly 50% of Gaza, and the ceasefire agreement stipulates that its withdrawal is contingent on Hamas disarming — two sticking points in the ceasefire deal that have  yet to be worked out .\n \n\n   \n  “Great challenges still lie ahead from enemies seeking to rearm,” Netanyahu said at Thursday’s ceremony. “Great challenges — and alongside them, dramatic opportunities to expand the circle of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  He also pledged once again to “bring back all the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald  Trump said  he would consider allowing Netanyahu to resume military action in Gaza if Hamas refuses to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ibrahim Dahman and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-hamas-warning-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"16:42:00-04:00","title":"Trump threatens to ‘go in and kill’ Hamas if group doesn’t stop killing in Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric by threatening to allow Israel to 'go in and kill' Hamas fighters in Gaza if the group continues killing Palestinians, marking a sharp reversal from his earlier optimistic stance after a ceasefire agreement was signed.

At one point, he declared the war was effectively “over.” Trump had also shrugged off early reports that Hamas was cracking down on so-called gangs in the Palestinian territory, even as footage emerged of an apparent public execution.\n \n\n   \n  “They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad,” Trump said on Tuesday. “And that didn’t bother me much, to be honest with you.

And though Trump initially expressed ambivalence toward Hamas’ post-ceasefire attacks on Palestinians, he also warned that the group would ultimately have to disarm or “we will disarm them.”\n \n\n   \n  “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” Trump told Tapper in a brief telephone call. “If Israel could go in and knock the crap out of them, they’d do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to an Israeli source, but the nature of the conversation could not immediately be learned. In the Oval Office after that conversation, he expressed confidence the deal would hold.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that we have a commitment from them and I assume they’re going to honor their commitment,” he said of Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/trump-doj-first-terrorism-antifa-case","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00Z","title":"Justice Department Brings First Terrorism Case Tied to Its Antifa Crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has brought its first federal terrorism case linked to its campaign against Antifa, charging Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold (also known as Autumn Hill) with being members of an 'Antifa Cell' that planned and executed a violent attack on a federal immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas.

Department brings first terrorism case tied to its Antifa crackdown \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department brought its first federal terrorism case in the Trump administration’s crackdown on Antifa Wednesday, alleging that two people connected to the left-wing ideology participated in a coordinated attack on a federal immigration detention facility.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors accuse Zachary Evetts and Cameron Arnold, who also goes by the name Autumn Hill, of being members of an “Antifa Cell” that used vandalism and fireworks to draw law enforcement officers out of an immigration detention facility near Fort Worth, Texas, and into the sights of two shooters positioned in a line of trees across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment is a major step in the administration’s campaign against Antifa, which they say wants to violently challenge the federal government and Trump’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Trump designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization  last month. \n \n\n   \n  Until the case against Evetts and Arnold was unsealed Thursday, it was unclear how federal prosecutors planned to legally define Antifa as a terrorist organization. Antifa is largely thought of as more of an ideology than an organized group,  CNN has previously reported. \n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors answered that question in court documents, describing Antifa as a “militant enterprise made up of networks of individuals and small groups” who have “espoused insurrection” and propose violent attacks against the US government.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for Arnold and Evetts didn’t immediately return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Late into the night of July 4, a group of roughly a dozen individuals began shooting fireworks and spray-painting cars and structures at the detention facility, prosecutors say. Around the same time two correctional officers at the facility began to approach the group, a local police officer arrived responding to 9-11 calls about the incident, court filings say.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the officer got out of his vehicle, one of the members of the group opened fire from a line of trees across the street, shooting him in the neck, prosecutors say. The officer survived the wound.\n \n\n   \n  Another member of the group began to fire at the officers and, after shooting 20 to 30 rounds, the group dispersed and fled the scene, court filings say.\n \n\n   \n  Detectives later said they determined that both rifles used in the shooting were purchased by ex-Marine Benjamin Hanil Song, who has been charged with attempted murder of a federal officer. Fourteen people were charged in relation to the shooting, including some who prosecutors say tried to hide Song after the incident.\n \n\n   \n  According to the indictment against Evetts and Arnold, members of the group had been planning the attack over group chats in the days prior, sharing a map of the area, discussing where security cameras could be located at the facility, as well as nearby police stations.\n \n\n   \n  In discussing what weapons to bring, Song suggested bringing “a wagon” of armor and rifles, adding that “cops are not trained or equipped for more than one rifle so it tends to make them back off,” prosecutors said in the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators said they recovered 10 guns from the group, some of which were left at the scene of the shooting. Four were purchased by Song, whose firearm was equipped with a binary trigger, prosecutors say, which allows a gun to shoot two bullets for every pull of the trigger.\n \n\n   \n  The goal of the group, according to the indictment against Evetts and Arnold, “was to destroy US government property and commit acts dangerous to human life intended to influence” US policy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/stacey-abrams-georgia-voter-turnout-groups","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:32:00-04:00","title":"Georgia Voter Turnout Groups Founded by Stacey Abrams Close Down","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two voter turnout organizations founded by Stacey Abrams — the New Georgia Project and its affiliated Action Fund — have announced their closure, raising concerns about the sustainability of progressive voter organizing in Georgia.

Their closure, along with  legal losses  sustained by another Abrams-founded organization — Fair Fight — raise questions about whether Abrams’ model of voter organizing can be sustained. The loss of the groups comes as Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff seeks reelection in 2026 and Democrats try to win a governor’s race in Georgia for the first time since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  “We recognize that the work of building a just and truthful world remains urgent,” directors said in a statement released by the Rev. James Woodall, who chaired the board of the New Georgia Project Action Fund. “This moment calls for strong and courageous leaders to step forward, guided by principles and purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  The groups registered tens of thousands of voters, building on Abrams’ belief that moderation wasn’t the path to power for Democrats in the Deep South. Instead, she sought to make steady voters out of less-engaged people who support progressive measures.\n \n\n   \n  The strategy won plaudits in 2018, when Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican  Brian Kemp . Then in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden  won the state’s presidential vote  and a burst of enthusiasm elected Ossoff and Democrat Raphael Warnock to the US Senate in a  January 2021 runoff . That swung control of the upper chamber to their party.\n \n\n   \n  New Georgia Project organizers, in purple and orange or lime green t-shirts, were familiar sights in inner-city Atlanta neighborhoods and  rural Georgia towns , as the groups focused on areas with low turnout.\n \n\n   \n  “For progressive politics, I haven’t seen anything yet that is going to replicate the amount of outreach, door knocks, conversations that New Georgia Project was able to achieve,” said Stephanie Jackson Ali, who was the organization’s policy director until she was laid off in July.\n \n\n   \n  Abrams stepped down in 2017 and said she had no role with the groups thereafter. Warnock, a close Abrams ally and Baptist minister, was listed as the New Georgia Project’s CEO on corporate filings in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Abrams has said the group’s troubles are “disappointing” but declined further comment Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson Ali said the group  knocked on  4 million doors in 2020. But even with Abrams outraising Kemp in 2022 and with New Georgia Project and similar groups  beating the bushes  for voters,  Abrams lost to Kemp  by a larger margin than in 2018. Warnock did win reelection in a runoff that year, partly by projecting a more moderate image than Abrams. And 2024  was a step back  for Democrats in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris won 75,000 more Democratic votes in Georgia than Biden, but Republican turnout for Trump increased by 200,000, powering him to victory.\n \n\n   \n  But the New Georgia Project faced additional headwinds, with questions about leadership and spending dragging on donations. The Georgia Ethics Commission levied a  record-breaking $300,000 fine  against the groups in January after finding they did illegal election work and fundraising for Abrams in 2018 by failing to register as an independent campaign committee before taking contributions and failing to file campaign finance reports of contributions and spending.\n \n\n   \n  The fine was followed by multiple rounds of layoffs, including of some employees who said they were targeted for trying to unionize.\n \n\n   \n  Ethics Commission Executive Director David Emadi said the groups have “fully complied with the order,” with the final installment of the fine paid over the summer.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson Ali said it has been “heartbreaking” to watch the New Georgia Project struggle for funding.\n \n\n   \n  “We just had such a large apparatus, that as soon as funding slowed, we couldn’t be sustained,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/joe-rogan-trump-surprise-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:17:00-16:00","title":"Joe Rogan is unpleasantly surprised by Trump’s actions.

unpleasantly surprised by Trump’s actions. He’s hardly alone \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:17 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Podcast host Joe Rogan last week bemoaned the state of  President Donald Trump’s  increasingly brutal and militarized mass deportation campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I did not ever anticipate seeing that on TV on a regular basis,” Rogan  said , referring to images of Trump “ripping parents out of their communities.”\n \n\n   \n  “I really thought they were just going to go after the criminals,” added Rogan, who sports heterodox political views but used his hugely popular show to  endorse Trump  on the eve of the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  There are two ways to look at Rogan’s comments. One is: How in the world did Rogan not think Trump would do this? While campaigning, Trump spoke openly about how  expansive and heavy-handed  this initiative would be. As far back as 2015, he approvingly cited   Dwight Eisenhower’s brutal deportation campaign .\n \n\n   \n  But the other is: Maybe Rogan isn’t alone. Maybe the extraordinary nature of what Trump is doing, on many fronts, is starting to set in and casual political followers are beginning to notice he’s going further than they countenanced.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a certain conventional wisdom right now that, while what Trump is doing is extreme, it’s pretty much what he promised. The American people voted for this — or at least 49.8% of them.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s worth calling that conventional wisdom into question.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, on several key fronts, large numbers of Americans didn’t seem to fully anticipate what Trump is now doing – or at least, the extent of it.\n \n\n   \n    Most Americans claim it’s what they expected, but …\n \n\n   \n  Polling during Trump’s second term has generally shown most Americans at least claim to be unsurprised by what the president is doing.\n \n\n   \n  An  AP-NORC poll  in April showed 71% of Americans said Trump’s first few months had been mostly what they expected. A  CBS News-YouGov poll  earlier this month showed more said Trump is doing “the same things he promised in the campaign” (52%) than said he was doing “different things” (48%).\n \n\n   \n  But these numbers might not tell the whole story.\n \n\n   \n  For one, people might not like to admit they were wrong about what Trump would do. Admitting Trump defied your expectations would imply that you got things wrong.\n \n\n   \n  And two, the CBS poll isn’t a particularly strong affirmation of Trump keeping his promises. It’s a very low bar to say Trump has generally done what he promised, and nearly half of Americans say he hasn’t.\n \n\n   \n  Fully 53% of independents and even about 1 in 5 Republicans say Trump isn’t doing what he promised. Those are large numbers.\n \n\n   \n  And very notably, the percentage of Americans who say Trump is clearing that low bar has dropped significantly. The percentage who say he’s doing the “same things he promised” has declined from  70% in February  to  61% in April  to 52% this month.\n \n\n   \n  That would suggest large numbers of people have gradually come to believe this wasn’t what the country signed up for.\n \n\n   \n    The specific policies\n \n\n   \n  Between the 2024 election and Trump’s inauguration,  CNN ,  New York Times-Ipsos  and  Reuters-Ipsos polling  tested a number of expectations for Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  And in many cases, the American people were directionally right in what they predicted. The polls showed huge majorities thought it was at least plausible that Trump would deport millions of people, levy large tariffs and pardon lots of January 6, 2021, defendants, as Trump promised. A large majority also thought he would probably try and use the Justice Department against his foes.\n \n\n   \n  But even in some of these cases, it’s not difficult to see how Americans might be surprised by the extent of what Trump has done so far.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, the Ipsos polls showed two-thirds of Americans said it was at least “somewhat likely” that Trump would use the government to investigate and prosecute his foes, as he’s now done in the cases of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  But fewer than 4 in 10 said it was “very likely.”\n \n\n   \n  And the polls showed many or most Republicans wagered he wouldn’t do it. The Reuters-Ipsos poll showed as many as 69% of Republicans said Trump was “not likely” to use DOJ to go after his enemies.\n \n\n   \n  The story is similar, if less pronounced, with deportations.\n \n\n   \n  While a slight majority said Trump ordering mass deportations was at least “very likely,” according to the Reuters-Ipsos poll, nearly half rated it only “somewhat likely” or “not likely” – including half of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  Just 31% of Americans said it was “very likely” that Trump would increase tariffs on China and Mexico, which he has done.\n \n\n   \n  The polling on Trump’s January 6 pardons is also worth raising\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll showed Americans predicted 78%-21% that Trump would pardon most people convicted of crimes for the attack on the Capitol, as Trump suggested he would.\n \n\n   \n  But he didn’t just pardon  most people ; he pardoned  virtually everyone  – including hundreds convicted of assaulting police and several convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  And he did so after providing tons of mixed messages about his intentions, at some points suggesting the pardons  would be reserved for nonviolent offenders .\n \n\n   \n    The conclusions\n \n\n   \n  The throughline here seems to be that lots of people thought it was possible Trump would do these things, but they didn’t necessarily see them as being especially likely.\n \n\n   \n  A likely reason why? Trump says lots of things, and many of them never come to fruition. He’s spent years inviting people to pick and choose what to take seriously and what to take literally. It’s a neat political trick that allows people to believe what they want and to ignore the rest by dismissing it as bluster.\n \n\n   \n  And the total picture suggests that people are indeed seeing things they didn’t fully expect – and now don’t like. On a plethora of issues, a majority of Americans have said Trump is going “too far,” and that  includes many who voted for him . Americans generally liked the idea of Trump’s mass deportation policy, but more recent polls show most  don’t like how he’s gone about it .\n \n\n   \n  A  Pew Research Center poll  from June is a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly half of Americans (48%) said Trump’s actions were worse than they expected, compared to about 2 in 10 who said they were better than expected.\n \n\n   \n  All of which would suggest it’s hardly just Rogan who’s been unpleasantly surprised.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/europe/catholic-church-sexual-abuse-commission-report-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:17:00-04:00","title":"Catholic Church must do more to help sexual abuse survivors and hold church leaders to account, hard-hitting report says","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new annual report from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors criticizes the Catholic Church’s long-standing failure to properly handle sexual abuse allegations, citing denial, retaliation, and lack of support for survivors.

church leaders to account, hard-hitting report says \n       \n  By Christopher Lamb, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:17 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Vatican commission for the protection of children has said the mishandling by the Catholic Church’s leaders of  sexual abuse allegations  involving clergy is causing “ongoing harm” to victims, in a hard-hitting report released Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The report also called out parts of Italy and Africa for failing to implement robust anti-abuse measures.\n \n\n   \n  The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which released its second  annual report  on October 16 called for greater transparency from the Vatican and noted with “concern” that survivors often perceive the church’s central administration as “lacking in sensitivity.”\n \n\n   \n  The report is the first to be released since the election of Pope Leo XIV and it sets out the scale of the challenge for the American pope in tackling the scourge of sexual abuse of children and vulnerable people inside the Catholic Church. His predecessor, Pope Francis, took some important steps to tackle the abuse crisis but  experts and survivors have said he could have gone further .\n \n\n   \n  “We must re-emphasise that the Church’s decades-long pattern of mishandling reports, including abandoning, ignoring, shaming, blaming, and stigmatising victims/survivors, perpetuates the trauma as an ongoing harm,” the report states.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the report calls for the Church to offer “reparations” for damage done by abuse, including psychological and financial support, sensitive listening to survivors, public and private apologies and reforms to how abuse is handled.\n \n\n   \n  It includes scathing statements from survivors, who describe “denial and dismissal” from church authorities and even “disturbing accounts of retaliation” taken by bishops and other leaders when victims came forward. Survivors also talked about a “lack of psychological care” for those affected and “strong resistance to safeguarding reforms” in churches at the grassroots level. A “lack of accountability” from the hierarchy was frequently cited as an issue.\n \n\n   \n  “Figures of authority within the Church who perpetrate or enable abuse have perhaps viewed themselves as too essential and important to be held accountable. The Church’s response to abuse should not repeat the same mistakes,” the report states.\n \n\n   \n  On accountability, the commission calls on the Vatican to start communicating the reason for a bishop’s resignation or removal if this is related to “cases of abuse or negligence.” The current practice is for the Vatican to simply announce when a bishop has resigned without elaborating.\n \n\n   \n  The commission is led by French archbishop Thibault Verny and includes a mixture of church leaders and experts, among them Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children who led the compilation of the report.\n \n\n   \n  The 200-page document provides an assessment on how churches in various parts of the world are dealing with abuse, including on the pope’s doorstep in Italy. Catholic groups and victims have long argued that the Catholic Church in Italy has yet to face up to abuse scandals and needs to entrust this to an independent body.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at a Vatican press conference to release the report, de Boer-Buquicchio thanked the media for “uplifting the voices of victims and survivors when the institutional church has failed to listen.” She stressed that victim-survivors repeatedly state they “want to feel heard and validated in their experiences.”\n \n\n   \n  Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera, the secretary of the commission, said that Pope Leo had the “same strong commitment” to tackling abuse as his predecessor, although brings an “analytical” style. The Colombian prelate also recognised the call for the Church to move faster in tackling abuse.\n \n\n   \n  In its report, the pontifical commission highlights failures in the Italian church. While it cites “significant progress” on child protection, it warns that “substantial cultural resistance in Italy to addressing abuse” remains. Pointedly, it said it “regrets” that significant portions of the church leadership have not even met with the Vatican’s abuse commission and that several dioceses did not provide information to the commission about their safeguarding work.\n \n\n   \n  The Italian bishops’ conference said the abuse commission report contained “partial data” and insisted that “all Italian regions and dioceses” have a protection service.\n \n\n   \n  “The Report does not account for all this work,” the bishops’ conference said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Africa, protocols for dealing with abuse were frequently found to be severely lacking, the commission said. In Equatorial Guinea, the report said, it could not find “any mention of procedures for receiving complaints” and in Ethiopia it cited “resistance” from leaders to take “direct responsibility” for abuse. Bishops in Kenya   said “cultural taboos make reporting very difficult for victims/survivors,” the report added.\n \n\n   \n  The commission also calls on the Vatican’s Dicastery for Evangelization, a department which deals with churches in the developing world, to invest more in the drawing up of anti-abuse policies, noting a “lack of sufficient resources” when it comes to vetting the safeguarding records of candidates to become bishops.\n \n\n   \n  The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors was established by Pope Francis in 2014 and in 2022 he asked them to draw up an annual report on how the church was dealing with abuse and safeguarding. The first  report was published last year .\n \n\n   \n  Since his election on May 8, Leo XIV has said it is “urgent to ingrain throughout the Church a culture of prevention that does not tolerate any form of abuse,” while praising journalists for uncovering abuse scandals.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577704","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"No Kings Protests: Demonstrators Rally Across U.S. to Protest Trump Administration Policies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 18, 2025, demonstrators across the United States participated in a nationwide No Kings rally to protest the policies of the Trump Administration.

But the situation facing one group of federal employees who are working without pay is difficult for lawmakers to overlook: The Capitol Police officers who protect them every day. The officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10th. \"They're asked to be everything to everybody,\" said Terry Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief. \"You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also have to be a person who will welcome visitors and be a tour guide.\" Gainer says the job is tougher than ever, as public officials face growing threats and violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gesturing toward two officers guarding the ornate Senate Reception Room, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she feels for the force's more than 2,000 officers and that Democrats are to blame for the impasse. \"These men and women are paying the price,\" Britt said. \"It's absolutely selfish and ridiculous. It's heartbreaking. People have mortgages, they have families.\" Officer Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chair, called on lawmakers last week to end the shutdown, writing in a statement that \"Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass.\" Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who sits on the House committee that oversees the force, says he has kept in touch with Papathanasiou and Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan. \"What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all and yet we're walking among people who are directly impacted by this,\" Morelle said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has signaled  plans to repurpose funds  to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, though Democrats have questioned the legality of the moves. \"I'm not unhappy with that result if it's the case,\" Morelle said. \"But I'm still mindful of the fact that what the president is talking about, whether it's military troops or law enforcement, it's patently illegal,\" he said. Morelle says the missed checks are not the only slight, saying officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose  President Trump's pardons of rioters  who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th. He notes a Jan. 6 memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol  is still uninstalled  on Capitol Hill, despite a federally-mandated deadline. \"We've always stood with Capitol police and law enforcement and we've shown that in word and deed,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters last week. \"All of a sudden after all of these issues where they have been frankly insulting to members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, 'Oh well, we really care about them,\" Morelle said. Gainer, the former Capitol Police chief, said officers continue to do their jobs with professionalism, but each slight makes it more difficult to convince them that the long hours and personal risk are worth staying for. Last week, Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif.,   briefly clashed with an officer  during a protest, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology. Barragán said the officer grabbed her as she tried to enter Johnson's office. \"One of the skill sets we require of police officers is your ability to remember, because you're good witnesses,\" Gainer said. \"So your memory doesn't get erased, but what you try to do is reset the clock.\" Asked this week whether they were holding up during the shutdown, a group of officers said they were — \"for now.\" But one officer had an addendum to that assessment. \"Give it a month, maybe not,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577977","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:46:00-04:00","title":"Protesters Decry Trump Administration Policies in No Kings Rallies Across the U.S.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, thousands of protesters across the United States participated in the second major wave of 'No Kings' rallies, a movement that criticizes President Donald Trump’s leadership style as monarchical and authoritarian.

rallies across the U.S. \n         By Alana Wise, Chandelis Duster \n        \n           Updated Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 10:46 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Demonstrators across the U.S. took to the streets on Saturday to protest the policies of President Trump. The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that the president is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official. This is the  second massive wave of protests  organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda. Organizers projected a turnout in the millions across some 2,600 events around the country. In New York City's Times Square, protesters carried signs that read: \"resist the fascists traitors\" and \"No crowns, No kings,\" spilled into the crowd of Broadway matinee show attendees,  Gothamist reported. The No Kings group said it had already achieved its goal in June and was ready to send the White House yet another statement. \"In June, we did what many claimed was impossible: peacefully mobilized millions of people to take to the streets and declare with one voice: America has No Kings,\" No Kings said on its  website . The overwhelmingly peaceful  June protests  were in response to a military parade held on the Army's 250th anniversary — which coincided with Trump's 79th birthday. Critics said Trump had pushed for the extravagant parade not to commemorate the armed forces, but as a display of his own vanity. \"Now, President Trump has doubled down,\" No Kings said on its website, citing  immigration detentions  carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal  education resources  and  environmental protections ,  gerrymandering  and other concerns. No Kings organizers estimated that  more than 5 million people  turned out for the June protests. They speculated that Saturday's event could be even bigger. No Kings held one of its largest protests in Washington, D.C. No Kings events were not planned for the city during the June protests when the military parade was held. Demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read \"No Kings, No Tyrants\" and some even wearing costumes. There were also many people wearing yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity. Sen. Bernie Sanders of (I-Vt.)  addressed D.C. protesters  in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president, calling out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg \"and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.\" Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR \"we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.\" \"This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,\" Kitchen said. Trump, himself, was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Lt. Patrick Loftus, a spokesperson for D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, told NPR the department made no arrests during the protest. In Chicago, a city Trump has repeatedly criticized over crime, Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke to a cheering crowd. \"Now listen, there are those in this country who have decided at the behest of the President to declare war on Chicago and American cities across this country!\" the Democratic official said. \"But we are here to stand firm, to stand committed that we will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit to the authoritarianism that is coming down!\" The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it  to deploy National Guard troops  in Illinois after lower courts blocked the deployment. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, slammed the demonstration as a \" hate America rally ,\" and other Republicans have derided the movement as anti-American. \"It's all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people,\" Johnson said last week on Fox News. \"They're all coming out.\" Lucia Wrobleswski from Afton, Minn., a city council member and former police officer pushed back on the rhetoric: \"They keep saying that we who are anti-fascist or Democrats are terrorists and fascists and it's such a lie,\" she said while at a local rally. Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\" Maria Floriano showed up to an event in San Pablo, Calif., wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies. She compared immigration to butterflies, saying \"migration is beautiful\" and \"an act of courage.\" Floriano, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants, said: \"We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here.\" At a rally in Sarasota, Fla., Jim Rosinus, chairman of Lee County's Democratic Party, said that although party leadership was there to supply signs and refreshments, the event was nonpartisan. \"It's not a Democratic Party thing, and there are a lot of people here who are not Democrats,\" he said. \"They're either NPAs or even Republicans; there are a lot of Republicans who are just fed up with where their party is going and what's happening and want to show it.\" That sentiment was echoed at rallies in other cities, including Salt Lake City, where protester Adam Livingston, a 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, wore fatigues and carried a Marine Corps flag. \"Veterans and even active duty service members need to realize that we're loyal to the Constitution and not to a faith, a political party, an ideology, or a man,\" he said. Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas, in preparation for the day of protesters, mobilized their states' National Guards. \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to  VPM . The Texas Newsroom  reported  that Abbott said in a statement about sending the Guards to Austin: \"Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas. Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Standing by a traffic light in Plano, Texas, Jenny Colombo held a rainbow-trimmed sign that said \"The Emperor Has No Clothes.\" \"I feel President Trump is the epitome of that character,\" Colombo told  member station KERA . \"Everybody is just walking around him, everybody can see what's going on, and they're all just supporting him blindly.\" As of Saturday evening, protests appeared to have been peaceful with no major incidents of violence reported. New York City police said  events there drew an estimated 100,000 people across all five boroughs and that it made no protest-related arrests. Speaking to  Connecticut Public , that state's lead No Kings organizer, Jim Chapdelaine, reiterated the coalition's commitment to peace and the importance of people showing up for what they believe in. \"There are powers that be that would prefer we all just stay at our houses and, I don't know, take up crochet,\" Chapdelaine said in a Tuesday interview. \"It's really important to build community and solidarity and unity, [and] especially important to do that in a very peaceful way.\" NPR's Joel Rose, KQED reporter Brian Krans, MPR's Dana Ferguson, KUER's Martha Harris and WGCU's Mike Braun contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558451","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-20:00","title":"A caregiver's survival guide: Advice from people who've been there","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article from NPR, written by Kat McGowan and Connie Hanzhang Jin, offers a caregiver’s survival guide based on over 600 real-life stories and practical advice from individuals who have experienced caregiving for an ill or elderly loved one.

Click on these buttons or scroll to navigate to each section The medical maze: How to help your person through it One of the first tasks adult caregivers face is learning the ropes of the crazy U.S. health care system. You're likely becoming both a patient advocate and a medical coordinator — two jobs with steep learning curves. Here's what other caregivers have learned. The new normal: This isn't the life I planned. How do I adjust? Caregiving is now your new normal. But fully accepting and adjusting to this changed reality can take a while. Often, it comes in waves — periods of calm interrupted by wild turmoil.  Here are tips for enduring these times. Help! How to ask for (and accept) support The No. 1 piece of advice from other caregivers: Get help, whether from a support group, a friend, other family, a therapist, your church, or all of the above. Caregiving is too hard and too isolating to do it on your own. As one caregiver put it, most people start the job as if it were a sprint and only slowly realize they're in a marathon. Try these caregivers' tips for getting the help you need. Self-care: It's essential and it's not what you think  It's not spa days and yoga classes. Real self-care means learning how to protect your mental and physical health despite the crushing demands on your time. Often, that starts with setting boundaries and forgiving yourself.  Explore what's worked for other caregivers. Your new relationship: Dealing with a changing dynamic You're no longer just a partner, spouse, parent or child. Now, you're also a caregiver, and that changes your relationship with your loved one in ways that can be hard to detect and difficult to adjust to.

This marks a significant shift from his earlier support for Ukraine to reclaim lost territory, as he now suggests that both sides should accept the current frontlines as permanent. Trump expressed hesitation in supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Kyiv sees as vital for striking deep into Russian territory and pressuring Putin to negotiate.

Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" Later, soon after arriving in Florida, where he's spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to \"stop the war immediately\" and implied that Moscow keep territory it's taken from Kyiv. \"You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it's too complicated,\" Trump told reporters. \"You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.\" The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by Trump. In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war. After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Zelenskyy after Friday's meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. He sidestepped directly answering a question about Trump nudging Ukraine to give up land. \"The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak,\" Zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about Trump's social media post, which he hadn't seen. Another change in tone Trump's tone on the war shifted after he held a lengthy phone call with Putin on Thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks. The president also signaled to Zelenskyy on Friday that he's leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table. Zelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a \"proposition\" in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the Tomahawk cruise missiles. But Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia's invasion. \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace,\" Trump said. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We'd much rather have the war be over to be honest.\" In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed. \"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" he said. Zelenskyy also said \"we need Tomahawks\" because \"it's very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.\" Trump's latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship. Why Tomahawks? But following Thursday's call with Putin, Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) Zelenskyy had been seeking the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump's calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously. Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks \"won't change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,\" according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser. It was the fifth face-to-face meeting for Trump and Zelenskyy since the Republican returned to office in January, The president said Friday it was \"to be determined\" if Zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in Hungary — suggesting a \"double meeting\" with the warring countries' leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations. \"These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump added. But Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin \"is not about feelings.\" \"They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don't intend to stop,\" Zelenskyy added. \"So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. Undoubtedly.\" Trump, going back to his 2024 campaign, insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in August, when he held a summit with Putin in Alaska and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies. Trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. But the Russian leader hasn't shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine. Asked Friday if he was concerned that Putin was stringing him along, Trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the Russian leader. \"I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" Trump said. He added, \"I think I'm pretty good at this stuff.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579045","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"15:38:00-04:00","title":"2 Survivors of Suspected Drug Vessel Will Be Sent to Home Countries, Trump Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for prosecution.

new gerrymandered congressional map \n         By Savannah Hawley-Bates \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 9:21 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Lately, on any given day, you'll find Leann Villaluz knocking on doors around Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide the fate of the state's new congressional map. \"There's a sense of resentment, even to regular voters who aren't as involved,\" Villaluz says. \"We have to pick up the slack for representatives who have been elected to do their simple duty and carry out the will of the voters. Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\" Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a  nationwide redistricting battle  in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by  redistricting in favor of Democrats , if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month. Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City. But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it. The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent  Chappell Roan concert  to get signatures. \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\" Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back  Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway  filed a lawsuit in federal court  arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after  initially rejecting it . But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid. \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\" The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval. \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\" The  Democratic National Committee  has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A  slew of lawsuits  have also been filed challenging the new districts. A legal effort, too  Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional. \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\" Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult. \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\" Most, but not all Republicans, are on board Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session. Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right. Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\" But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts. Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so. \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\" Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map. \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\" Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578304","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:47:00-20:00","title":"President Trump Commutes the Prison Sentence of George Santos","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York who was expelled from Congress in 2023 for fabricating personal and financial details to deceive donors.

\n           Updated Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:47 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump announced on Friday that he commuted the prison term of George Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes after he was expelled from the House over accusations that he stole money from campaign donors. Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately. Joseph Murray, one of Santos' lawyers,  told The Associated Press  that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J., around 11 p.m. Friday, and was greeted by his family. \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote. Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year. Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances. His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114  to remove him from office . Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos. The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos  was facing 23 criminal charges . Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago  about his military service . Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote. So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of  more than 1,500 people  charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received  a pardon  after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5572394","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Susan Stamberg gave NPR its voice","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article honors Susan Stamberg’s pivotal role in shaping National Public Radio (NPR) by highlighting her distinctive voice and journalistic style as the catalyst for NPR’s human, engaging, and relatable identity.

(movie) Guillermo del Toro was born to bring to life \n         By Glen Weldon \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Guillermo del Toro has made several monster movies of a particular bent — soulful, swoony, feverish films about grotesque-looking creatures who prove themselves more deeply human than the humans who reject them.  Hellboy  (2004) was a half-demon with a full heart. The Amphibian Man in  The Shape of Water   (2017)   was an emo f-boy with gill slits. Even the titular marionette in  Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio  ( 2022)   was such a mensch that he earned the right to trade in his knotty pine physiognomy for a flesh bag. Soulful, swoony, feverish, with a narrative that stacks the emotional deck in favor of the hideous outcast — I mean, that's pretty much the jacket copy you'd find on any volume of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel  Frankenstein , right? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Which is why this seems like the perfect match between story and muse; certainly  del Toro's been talking about  making his own version of the tale for decades, calling it his \"lifelong dream.\" That dream is now realized, and while the resulting film captures the tone and spirit of the original novel in all its breathless zeal and hie-me-to-yon-fainting-couch deliriousness, the many narrative tweaks del Toro has made — some of which work, some of which don't — ensure that you'd never mistake his  Frankenstein  for anyone else's. A monster matriculates It's light-years away, for example, from James Whale's iconic 1931 version, which surgically implanted Boris Karloff's lumbering, flat-topped, bolt-necked monster into the culture. Because while Whale was faithful to the bones (heh) of the novel, Karloff's Creature never grew, intellectually or aesthetically. Maybe Whale was worried doing so would rob the monster of its primal power to clomp its way into his audience's nightmares. The book's Creature, on the other hand, puts itself through a kind of hilarious autodidactical speed run, devouring  Plutarch's Lives  and  The Sorrows of Young Werther  and, famously,  Paradise Lost . Which is why you get the following disconnect: Book Creature: \"I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.\" Karloff's Creature: \"FIRE BAD.\" There's a lot more of book Creature in del Toro's  Frankenstein , which is good, because his monster inhabits the (literally, in this case) sculpted frame and brooding gaze of Jacob Elordi. For roughly half of his time onscreen, Elordi's more or less in \"FIRE BAD\" mode, stumbling around in yellowish strips of cloth that, intentionally or not (but let's face it, probably intentionally) evoke the gold lamé speedo sported by his  Rocky Horror Picture Show  analog. But before long the Creature installs that all-important upgrade: He secretly observes the daily life of a loving family, befriends their kindly blind patriarch (David Bradley) and avails himself of their reading matter. Elordi makes his Creature 2.0 just as compelling as the launch version; now outfitted with the full complement of human-emotion DLC (rage, yes — but also gratitude, empathy, sorrow and regret), he sets out to confront Victor (Oscar Isaac), his preening, arrogant brat of a creator. This is all straight from Shelley's novel, of course — it's just inflected by del Toro's maximalist, heart-affixed-firmly-to-the-sleeve sensibility, which extends to absolutely everything onscreen. The production design goes gratifyingly hard, featuring drawing rooms so huge their walls vanish into shadow, landscapes so vast they swallow the characters — and the buildings they occupy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Victor's lonely tower — the site of the Creature's birth — is a gargoyle-festooned ruin atop a cliff so open to the elements that its rooms and staircases are piled with leaves and other bits of decaying organic matter. Its tiled floors feature yawning pits like frozen whirlpools, foreboding but strangely beautiful. Spare parts But del Toro's spin on the material goes beyond its look and feel – he's made several changes to the story that leave you wondering what narrative work they are actually doing, besides adding needless complications to justify the film's two-and-half-hour running time. He devotes a lot of attention — far more than the book does — to the life of young Frankenstein (heh), played by Christian Convery. Charles Dance adds yet another \"stern father\" performance to an IMDB page teeming with them, as Victor's demanding dad, and their frosty, lightly sadistic relationship is clearly meant to foreshadow the one Victor will have with his Creature. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tim Burton's  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , and its mystifying determination to explain to us that Wonka only became the candymaker he did because his father was … a dentist. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The film also introduces Christoph Waltz as Harlander, a mysterious figure who acts as Victor's financial patron. The character ostensibly exists to contrast Victor's scientific zeal to the greedy drive of capitalism, but I can't shake the conviction that he could easily lift out of the film without leaving a hole. A subplot involving Mia Goth's Elizabeth represents another significant alteration that's puzzling at first — why make Elizabeth the fiancée of Victor's brother William (Felix Kammerer) instead of just making her Victor's fiancée, as she is in the book? The answer lies in the largest and most essential change that del Toro is making to the story here, which is to turn Victor into even  more  of a jerk — and, by extension, to cast the Creature as even more sympathetic. It's there in Isaac's bluff, snotty, snooty take on Victor, who's forever declaring his genius to anyone in earshot. It's there in his snarling disgust at Elordi's poor, chained up Creature. And it's there in Victor's not-remotely-sly attempts to seduce his own brother's fiancée. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Elizabeth, for her part, is totally on board with del Toro's efforts to get us on the Creature's side; Goth shows us a young woman smart and self-possessed enough to recognize that underneath all the sutures and skin grafts, it's still Jacob Freaking Elordi we're talking about, here, people. Del Toro doesn't stop there — he also elides book-Creature's most unsavory aspects and actions to highlight his version's wet-eyed soulfulness and further cement its status as a blameless thing grievously wronged by the world in general, and by Victor in particular. It's a marked adjustment from the novel, yes — but one that seems inevitable, given del Toro's body of work, and his resolute need to portray the outsider as hero. He's never been subtle about this, and he's not here either: At one point a character regards Victor. \" You  are the monster,\" they tell him. I cannot hope to convey, reader, just how wildly unnecessary that line is, given literally everything about the film we've been watching up to that point. It's del Toro gilding a lily that he's already spent more than two hours painstakingly crafting out of pure, 24-carat gold. And yet it works, for him, and for his movie. Del Toro couldn't possibly do anything less, and, given how perfectly suited he is to tell this story in this particular way, you wouldn't want him to.

Depends who's asking \n         By Miles Parks, Bente Birkeland \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Scott Leiendecker announced he was buying Dominion Voting Systems — the elections technology company at the heart of countless 2020 election  conspiracy theories  — he teased a transformation. \"As of today, Dominion is gone,\" read the first line of a press release that seemed to many readers to  lean into  the unfounded rumors that have swirled around the company (and led to  hundreds of millions of dollars  in defamation settlements) since Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. \"We are turning the page and beginning the vital work of restoring faith in American elections,\" Leiendecker wrote in a public letter posted on the website for his new company, Liberty Vote. But in private, when speaking to the company's county election official customers, the messaging has been different, raising the question of how much the company plans to change. \"Feel assured that Liberty Vote shares the same values as Dominion,\" company representatives in Georgia, which has a statewide contract with the company, wrote in an email that NPR reviewed that was sent to counties after the sale was announced. \"Same team, same support, different name.\" In Colorado, where Dominion was headquartered and where 60 of 64 counties have a contract with the company, Molly Fitzpatrick, who's the Democratic Boulder County clerk, talked with Leiendecker shortly after the sale and helped facilitate another call to include every clerk in the state. \"He reiterated that he is an elections person and he has a long track record of being involved in elections,\" Fitzpatrick said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After serving as a Republican elections director in St. Louis 20 years ago, Leiendecker started a company, KNOWiNK, in 2011 that has become the United States' largest vendor for voter check-in technology. And while the message on Liberty Vote's website notes KNOWiNK's ubiquity in U.S. elections, the Liberty Vote press release doesn't mention KNOWiNK and paints Leiendecker as more of an outsider, referring to him as a \"nationally recognized election reform advocate.\" Leiendecker did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. A press release's partisan tone The press release announcing the Dominion sale nodded at conservative election priorities, highlighting Liberty Vote's 100% American ownership and a mission to \"restore public confidence in the electoral process through transparent, secure, and trustworthy voting systems, including the use of hand-marked paper ballots.\" Liberty Vote also promised to comply with Trump's March executive order on election security, which has  largely been paused by federal judges . David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said that he couldn't remember an election vendor ever seeking out publicity in the way Liberty Vote did and that the partisan tone of the announcement may generate even more suspicion around the company than existed before. \"I thought the announcement was weird — I'll be honest,\" Becker said. \"That just raised a lot of questions on the part of election officials. They're already under siege. There is already so much disinformation swirling about voting systems and their security. … They don't want drama around their voting systems.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some in the voting world see the difference in the public and private messaging as more of a rebrand aimed at capitalizing on doubts that people have about elections, rather than transforming the company into a partisan entity. As one state voting official, who was not authorized to speak about the sale publicly, put it to NPR: \"[Leiendecker] sees an opportunity to sell Dominion to all the conservative jurisdictions who wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole the past five years.\" \"It's all business for him,\" the official said. \"Is this a GOP takeover?\" Some Colorado clerks were frustrated they were given no notice before the sale was made public. \"There was no notification to us that this was even a conversation,\" said Tiffany Lee, the politically unaffiliated clerk of La Plata County, in southwest Colorado. \"That's concerning to me that we didn't get any kind of information from [Liberty Vote] directly or Dominion.\" The announcement — along with Leiendecker's history as a Republican elections official — raised questions for some voters as well, Lee said: \"It was, 'Is this a GOP takeover? Are elections going away? What's happening?' Probably one of the biggest questions I've overall gotten is, 'Are we gonna continue to have elections?'\" Lee and other election officials are urging calm, considering that nothing about the equipment used to scan and count votes is even changing in the short term. In most cases, voters whose ballots were tallied using Dominion technology in 2024 will have their votes counted in the 2026 midterms using the same machines. \"From a security and technical perspective, everything still stands,\" Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, said. \"We still have multiple checks and balances to demonstrate and verify the integrity of the system. Everything that we have been saying for years is still the same.\" The sale may not satisfy conspiracy theorists Like  most of the country , Colorado is a paper-ballot state, and by law, all Colorado counties conduct risk-limiting audits after each election, double-checking the scanning machines' tallies against the actual votes on the original paper ballots. While audits and hand counts have shown that the state's election results are accurate, Colorado has been at the  epicenter of false election claims . That fact has many wondering whether a marketing campaign can actually win the buy-in of those convinced that Dominion was involved in stealing elections. Indeed, after the sale was announced, conservative activist and podcaster Joe Oltmann, a prominent election denier based in Colorado, blasted Leiendecker in a Facebook post. \"This guy is not a conservative... I truly hate what our country has become... it is literally a cartel that wear[s] different badges while stealing the voice in a sea of treason,\" posted Oltmann. NPR's Miles Parks reported from Washington, D.C., and Colorado Public Radio's  Bente Birkeland  reported from  Colorado . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566691","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"10:23:00-10:23","title":"Why are so many rich Americans investing in British soccer teams?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing trend of American investment in British soccer is transforming the ownership landscape of English and Welsh football.

Americans investing in British soccer teams? \n         By Robbie Griffiths \n        \n           Updated Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 10:23 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Nestled on Britain's south coast in the county of Dorset, Bournemouth is a quintessential English seaside town, known for its sandy beach and fish and chips. At the start of October, Bournemouth men's soccer team hosted Fulham, London's oldest professional soccer team, for a tightly contested Premier League match. But although these two soccer teams might seem entirely English, they are both actually owned by Americans. And they are not alone: teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United, who have fans around the world, also now all have American owners. In fact,  more than half  of the 92 teams in the top four leagues in England and Wales have some American ownership, while Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport,\" explains Jim Frevola, Bournemouth's president of business operations. Frevola moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the franchise for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola compares the prices of British soccer teams to franchises in sports like the NFL and NBA in America. \"Teams are going for six, eight billion … where you could buy teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity,\" Frevola said. \"And, it's the best league in the world of the best sport in the world.\" Since moving to Bournemouth, Frevola has been struck by the passion of English soccer fans. \"I never thought sports was different… until I came over here,\" Frevola said. \"It wasn't until two, three months of living here did I realize that this is their life … this is what people live and breathe for. That's special. That's unique.\" Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-tier team in Yorkshire, which he bought two years ago. \"I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming,\" Nagle joked. \"I purchased it outright in a really short period of time, sight unseen,\" he added. \"It wasn't until after the fact that I came to Huddersfield to see what it was like. And I was very, very happy.\" Nagle also owns a soccer team in California, Sacramento Republic. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. \"It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans, because their great, great, great-grandparents were watching the team play,\" Nagle says. \"Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not.\"  The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball star LeBron James in Liverpool. Similarly, actor Michael B. Jordan has a stake in Bournemouth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of the stars have made documentaries about their teams. First, Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds — who was born in Canada — and his fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney made the documentary  Welcome to Wrexham  about their journey buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham, which is now in its fourth season. This year, ex-NFL player Tom Brady joined them with his documentary  Built in Birmingham , about becoming co-owner of Birmingham City Football Club. TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer, particularly the  successful TV dramedy  Ted Lasso , about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. Starring Jason Sudeikis and Brett Goldstein, the show — which has won multiple Emmys — is set to release its fourth season next year. Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sport finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement in many of the franchises can be attention-grabbing, it usually takes the form of a minority stake. \"They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income particularly around commercial partnerships,\" Philippou said. She explained that while English football has seen investment from Russia and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made their teams more commercial, as well as boosting women's football teams at many British franchises. \"We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football within club level … part of [that] is American money because traditionally they've been more interested in women's football.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the U.S., British soccer has a growing audience, with as many as 40 million fans, with many watching on CBS, says Ben Wright, chief commercial officer for the English Football League — which covers both England and Wales. Wright said interest in soccer in America grew noticeably during the pandemic. \"It felt like … because people couldn't go out and about globally, they were watching a lot more,\" Wright said. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi, the Argentinian who many consider the greatest soccer player of all time, plays for the American Major League Soccer team Inter Miami. On top of that, next summer's World Cup is being held jointly by the USA, Canada and Mexico, which experts hope will only grow the sport. Some soccer fans back in Britain fear that American owners might want to make changes to their league, such as playing league games in the USA. But Bournemouth's business manager Jim Frevola says that although he is aiming to grow his team's fan base back in the USA, there are no plans for major overhauls. \"I think there's maybe a misconception that American ownership wants to institute [big changes],\" Frevola said. \"I've heard crazy things like all-star games. That's never going to happen.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a pub near Bournemouth's Vitality Stadium, most fans are in favor of their American owner Bill Foley. Supporter Ceri Morgan said that although the slightly increased ticket prices have been a drawback, the investment is clear to see. \"The stadium looks a lot smarter now and we're getting an increased capacity next season,\" he said. His fellow life-long fan Dom Webb agreed. \"It's been incredible. … We've got really solid foundations now, and it feels like the sky's the limit,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, LeBron James, Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds have all invested in British soccer teams. They're part of a trend. Half of English Football League teams are now partly or wholly owned by Americans. Imagine. NPR's Robbie Griffiths went out to a game to find out why. (SOUNDBITE OF OCEAN WHOOSHING) ROBBIE GRIFFITHS, BYLINE: Nestled on Britain's south coast in the county of Dorset, Bournemouth is a quintessential English seaside town known for its sandy beach and fish and chips. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL CHANT) GRIFFITHS: Tonight, Bournemouth men's soccer team, known as The Cherries, are hosting Fulham, London's oldest professional club, in a tightly contested Premier League match. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And your Cherries, AFC Bournemouth. GRIFFITHS: But there's a twist. Although these two soccer teams might seem as English as they come, they are both owned by Americans. And they are not alone. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United, with fans around the world, all have American owners. JIM FREVOLA: It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport. GRIFFITHS: Jim Frevola is Bournemouth's president of business operations. He moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the club for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola explains that it's more affordable for rich Americans to invest in smaller British soccer teams and work on growing them than to buy sports franchises back in the USA, comparing prices to the NFL and NBA. FREVOLA: Teams are going for $6 billion, $8 billion, where you could buy, you know, teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity. And it's the best league in the world of the best sports - the best sport in the world. GRIFFITHS: In fact, half of the 72 teams in the English Football League have some American ownership, and Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. There are so many U.S. owners of British soccer clubs that many of them are in a WhatsApp group where they compare notes. KEVIN NAGLE: Well, here's the thing. I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming. Right? GRIFFITHS: Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-division team in Yorkshire. Nagel also owns a soccer team in Sacramento. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. NAGLE: It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans because their great, great, great grandparents, you know, were watching the team play. Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not. GRIFFITHS: The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball player LeBron James in Liverpool. Some have even made TV shows about their teams. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"WELCOME TO WREXHAM\") RYAN REYNOLDS: (As self) To make a diamond, you have to have pressure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROB MCELHENNEY: (As self) What could possibly go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANNING TATUM: (As self) I'm very much into this. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) UNIDENTIFIED FANS: (Shouting) Yeah. REYNOLDS: (As himself) Football. MCELHENNEY: (As self) Football. GRIFFITHS: That's Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds and fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney in their documentary about buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TED LASSO\") JASON SUDEIKIS: (As Ted Lasso) And all you fellas need to do is believe it. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) Ooh. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Coach, no. It's a sign. GRIFFITHS: TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer. This is the hugely successful TV dramedy \"Ted Lasso,\" about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. But it's the real-world Americans - notably celebrities - who seem to be making the difference. CHRISTINA PHILIPPOU: They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income, particularly around commercial partnerships. GRIFFITHS: Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sports finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement - usually a minority stake - helps with sponsorship. She explains that while English football has seen investment from Russians and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made it more commercial, as well as making other changes. PHILIPPOU: We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football, as well, within club level. Part of it is American money because traditionally, they've been more interested in women's football as well. (CROSSTALK) GRIFFITHS: Back in a pub in Bournemouth, some soccer fans having a pint were worried that American investors would want to change their game somehow. But most, like life-long Bournemouth supporter Dom Webb, said they are happy. The U.S. owners have raised ticket prices, but are also upgrading the stadium and signing better players. DOM WEBB: It's been incredible. We've got really solid foundations now. And, like, it feels like the sky's the limit, really. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Semenyo. (CHEERING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: The Cherries are heading to second in the Premier League.

administration says most federal layoffs aren't blocked by court order \n         By Andrea Hsu, Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 17, 2025 • 7:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order. That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday. Friday's court filing came  amid a legal fight  between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call \"politically driven RIFs,\" or reductions in force. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause. As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with \"an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.  At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs   have members or bargaining units. In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to \"err on the side of caution.\" She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding \"We ought not make it worse.\" The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order. The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.  In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions. Earlier this year, President Trump issued  an executive order  ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his  declaration to the court  about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown. \"HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,\" he wrote. \"Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.\" During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.  The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.  Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing. At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as \"ready, fire, aim\" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding \"to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston \"another far left, partisan judge.\" Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs \"an unfortunate consequence\" of the government shutdown. OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect. While the White House promised \"substantial\" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January. Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary. That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates. Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577136","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"With some shutdown pain points delayed for now, talks in Congress are 'nowhere'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is in a fourth week of a shutdown due to a failed Senate vote on a stopgap funding bill, with the House having passed a plan to fund agencies through November 21.

points delayed for now, talks in Congress are 'nowhere' \n         By Deirdre Walsh \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         With the Trump administration staving off some of the most painful impacts of the government shutdown, and a federal court ruling pausing layoffs for thousands of federal workers, the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill for a way out of the stalemate may be gone — at least for right now. In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to  a stopgap bill  passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21. After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were \"nowhere.\" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week. One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget  said  in a post on social media that it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\" The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover  the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers . The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security — including at TSA and ICE —  would be paid  \"for all hours worked during the shutdown period.\" OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said \"Democrat programs\" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet. Predicting tough days ahead  Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children. And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past. The approach \"may or may not take some pressure off,\" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable. Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts \"are just getting started,\" he warned. \"Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,\" Emmer said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority — denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House — as a way to force a debate about  expiring health care subsidies . They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table. Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers. He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies. \"Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.\" November 1 could be a key date  November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?\" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.  \"This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,\" according to Welch.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal \"happens after they open up the government.\" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome. Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, \"these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,\" he told reporters, referring to a \"No Kings\" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies. Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a \"deal\" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him  rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states . \"As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5571014","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:19:00-04:00","title":"As hundreds of millions of birds head south, the invisible danger is glass","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Every year, an estimated billion birds in the United States die from collisions with glass windows, primarily during migration season. Birds are unable to perceive glass as a barrier, mistaking it for open sky or trees—especially with transparent or reflective surfaces.

October 17, 2025 • 8:19 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Just after dawn in Washington, D.C., Stephanie Haley is walking a familiar downtown route, scanning the sidewalk next to office buildings. There, huddled on the ground, is a motionless olive-green songbird. It's an Acadian flycatcher, no doubt on its way to Central or South America before it slammed into a window. Haley quietly sidles up to it, gently placing a net over the bird. Then she picks the bird up, using a gloved hand. It begins peeping in dismay. \"This is a good sign, the fluttering, which means that hopefully he's just stunned,\" says Haley, who volunteers with a local group called  Lights Out DC , which urges people to turn off artificial lights during migration season, because these lights can attract birds and lead to deadly collisions. \"I'll take him to City Wildlife and the doctors will check him out,\" she says, referring to the local wildlife rescue nonprofit which organizes and runs Lights Out DC. But even though the vets put this bird in an oxygen chamber, it eventually succumbs to its injuries. Most collision victims do, even if they initially fly away. They can have concussions, and broken bones. \"They can be flying up to 30 miles per hour when they hit the glass, so it's a very loud thunk,\" says Lisbeth Fuisz, another volunteer. The latest estimates suggest that, every year in the United States, collisions with windows kill a billion birds. Other than cats and habitat loss, glass is the biggest danger birds face. But research and testing has shown what kinds of glass and window treatments really work to prevent collisions, says  Bryan Lenz , with the American Bird Conservancy. The trouble is, the advocates for the birds, like the birds themselves, are having to grapple with a landscape that is just covered with ubiquitous glass. \"It is becoming now a question of, how do we do it at a scale big enough,\" says Lenz, \"to save a billion birds.\" Transparent or reflective  Each night during migration season, hundreds of millions of birds take to the skies, flying through the night to take advantage of the evening's cool, stable air. They navigate with the help of the moon and the stars, and come down in the morning to rest. That's when they can encounter glass. Evolution hasn't prepared birds to deal with glass. If it's transparent, they think they can fly through it. If it's reflective, they can mistake the reflections for real trees and sky. Most collisions don't happen way up high. Instead, they typically occur close to the ground, below the treeline. So window collisions aren't just confined to cities. But cities tend to be where people go out looking for birds, trying to find them before the rats get them, or before custodians sweep them away. In DC, the data collected over the years by volunteers makes it clear that about a half-dozen buildings account for a large share of the deaths. Clearly, their architectural features confound the birds, turning the buildings into death traps where volunteers find corpses again and again. \"This is a problematic building,\" says Fuisz, walking up to one office complex on North Capitol street. It wraps around a plaza with trees, and has two sections that converge on a glass atrium, effectively funneling birds towards a multi-story wall of glass. \"Do you see how the reflection works?\" says Fuisz. \"It looks like you could keep going.\" On top of the building's entrance, a revolving door, she spots a small dead bird. It's a female yellowthroat that fell there after hitting the glass wall. \"That's a pretty common window collision victim,\" she says, carefully recording the death. Similar data collection efforts have been going on across the country, in places like Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Diego. The goal is to reveal the scale of a problem that's mostly invisible — unless something dramatic happens. A thousand birds On the night of October 4, 2023, hundreds of migrating birds slammed into McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago, a large building in one of the major migratory fly-ways that's floor-to-ceiling glass, right on the edge of Lake Michigan. This made headlines nationwide. \"People who never even thought about birds were suddenly like, 'Wait a minute, a thousand birds died in one night crashing into one building?'\" says  Tina Phillips , with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology This incident became something of a watershed. It inspired the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to convene a summit. Attendees included people from birding groups, government agencies, architecture firms, research universities, and dark sky groups that want to minimize artificial light. Phillips says they'd all been trying to prevent birds from hitting buildings, but separately. \"And so coming out of that meeting,\" she says, \"we knew we had to keep working together to really try to make this impact meaningful.\" They formed the  Bird Collision Prevention Alliance , and more than a hundred organizations have now joined, including federal agencies. They're sharing resources and ideas, and have working groups that meet frequently. This comes as the Trump administration has weakened federal protections for migratory birds, exempting companies from being responsible for birds killed accidentally. But members of the new alliance say their group isn't about pushing policy at the national level. \"We're just focusing on the science and we're focusing on the best way to save birds at scale,\" says Lenz, \"without getting bogged down in political conversations.\" He says in the past, people didn't know how to keep birds away from glass: \"People used to say, 'Put a hawk decal on your window and that's good because the birds will be scared of that.' The only thing that does is keep the bird from hitting the hawk decal.\" To understand how well modern solutions can work, consider the Chicago convention center where so many birds died in 2023. Staffers and researchers had been monitoring bird deaths there for some time, says chief operating officer and interim general manager  Patrick Allen . \"We were a big piece of glass sitting right out on the lake,\" he says. \"There's no doubt the reflections would attract the birds.\" After the high-profile mass collision, he says they decided to put an easy-to-install product on all of the windows. \"It's just nothing but a film with dots in a particular pattern,\" he says. \"You put it on the window, and you pull it off and the dots stay on.\" Data collected before and after this treatment showed that it reduced bird collisions by 95 percent. \"The numbers are awesome. We're very proud of it,\" says Allen, describing it as a \"win-win\" for both the convention center management and the birds. The fix cost over a million dollars, but Allen says that's only because they had a huge expanse of glass — enough to cover two football fields. And costs can come down if a building or major renovations are planned to be bird-friendly from the start. That's the case that wildlife advocates in Dallas are currently making, as that city is planning to substantially upgrade its Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. The convention center has been the top killer of birds in downtown Dallas among the 129 buildings that volunteers have monitored in the last few years, says Mei Ling Liu, community conservation director with the Texas Conservation Alliance. She says the center has accounted for 31% of the bird deaths they've logged. Her group is trying to get support for the new renovations to be done in a bird-friendly way. What's more,\"we're hoping to really use the case of the convention center to start having the conversations with other building managers,\" she says, saying that Dallas remains very bright at night during the migration season. Fixing it at home Only a few major cities in the U.S. have buildings requiring new construction or significant renovations to be done with bird-friendly materials — DC is one of them. And the data collected by volunteers in DC has convinced some building managers to make changes, like turning off lights and putting treatments on some windows. \"You would think that most buildings would care and want to fix the problem,\" says Stephanie Dalke, another volunteer with Lights Out DC. \"It turns out, it can be complicated and expensive to treat a commercial building.\" That's why she thinks it's important for homeowners to know what they can do. The cumulative effect of houses is large, because there's so many, but the amount of glass that needs to be treated at each one is small. The Bird Collision Prevention Alliance, for example, says a  start  could be treating home windows that have been known to have had a bird collision in the past, or windows that are near attractive features like birdfeeders or fruit trees. Dalke's monitoring path through DC takes her under a skyway that connects two buildings downtown. It's made of mirrored glass. \"We call this the walkway of death,\" she says. \"This is a very deadly spot.\" There on the ground is a dead ruby-throated hummingbird. It's tiny, the size of her thumb, with iridescent green feathers. It was on its way to Central America. \"It boggles the mind that these guys can fly over the Gulf of Mexico,\" she says. \"I mean, how can they do that? It's just amazing. But then we take them out, with some glass.\" She carefully notes the location and date, so this bird can go into the volunteer group's database. She takes a photo. Her cell phone is filled with hundreds of pictures of window collision victims. And then she keeps walking, looking for more — and hoping not to find them. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578266","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration asks Supreme Court to allow National Guard deployment in Illinois","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, specifically in the Chicago area, arguing that ongoing safety risks to federal personnel require federal intervention.

As legal challenges to President Trump's  push to send military troops to Democratic-led cities  make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue. In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to \"prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety\" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge  denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois . Sauer argued that the judge's ruling \"improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\" Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state. The Trump administration is \"going to litigate this as much as we can,\" Vice President JD Vance said  in an interview  with ABC's  This Week  on Sunday. \"We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.\" The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening. President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The president is currently in  a legal battle  with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.  Last month,  Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were \"tremendous levels\" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to  safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked . A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.  In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the  Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center  to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.  Trump, eyeing future troop deployments, has said Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, St. Louis, Mo., Oakland and San Francisco are next.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566732","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"The test for U.S. citizenship is about to get harder","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, including a harder civics test for immigrants applying for citizenship after October 20, 2025.

\n         By Adrian Florido \n        \n           Thursday, October 16, 2025 • 3:52 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is making it harder to pass the oral exam required for immigrants seeking naturalization as U.S. citizens.   The new test is also longer. Green card holders who file for citizenship after Oct. 20 will have to answer twice as many questions correctly during the civics interview that tests their knowledge of U.S. history, politics and government and that is one of the final steps in the naturalization process. The list of possible questions will also get longer and include more difficult questions. A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Matthew Tragesser, said in  a statement  when the changes were announced recently that the new test will ensure \"that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" It's just one of several changes the Trump administration has instituted to make citizenship harder to earn as it seeks more broadly to limit the ability of immigrants and visa holders to enter, remain or settle in the U.S. The citizenship test that USCIS has used  since 2008  requires applicants to answer six questions correctly out of 10. The  new test  will require 12 correct answers out of 20. The list of possible questions the agent chooses from will grow from 100 to 128, and many will be more difficult. Questions about U.S. holidays and geography and others with short answers – \"What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\" – are being reduced or eliminated, and replaced with tougher ones: \"Why did the United States enter the Persian Gulf War?\" (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To force the Iraqi military from Kuwait.\") Another new question: Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War? (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To stop the spread of communism.\") Aside from the tougher civics test, applicants for citizenship will also have to convince an immigration officer that they have \"good moral character.\" Until now, the absence of bad behavior or criminal conduct on an applicant's record has been enough. Now, they'll need to submit evidence of their \"positive contributions to American society.\" Immigration officers will also more rigorously check applicants' backgrounds, possibly interviewing co-workers, family members or neighbors. Advocates who help people prepare for the citizenship test say the changes present more obstacles in an already challenging and cumbersome process. \"It's hard to imagine that these changes don't have a negative impact on the number of people who are able to continue the naturalization process,\" said Julie Mitchell, legal director of the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles, which offers citizenship courses. \"Particularly considering that these changes will impact individuals with low literacy levels and those who don't have access to classes and preparation materials.\" She said the naturalization process could also become more uncertain, because it's unclear what standards immigration officers will use to assess \"good moral character.\" Speaking in Washington  last month , USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said that the current test is \"just too easy\" because some questions require simple answers, like naming the governor of an applicant's home state, or two federal holidays. \"We need to know more,\" Edlow said. \"Especially if we're going to really understand whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution as required by the statute.\" But Amanda Frost, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and the author of  You Are Not American , a book about the history of citizenship stripping, said that while requiring applicants for citizenship to jump over hurdles is appropriate, there's no proof that the existing naturalization process is falling short. \"Has there been any evidence that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share our values, and don't make for good participants in our democracy?\" Frost asked. \"I don't see any evidence of that.\" She notes that nearly  half of all Fortune 500  companies were founded by immigrants or their children. \"Those who naturalize, and their children, thrive in the United States, and have benefited this country,\" Frost said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The Trump administration is making it harder for immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens. Starting next week, it is rolling out changes to the civics test that candidates for citizenship are required to pass. This is one of several changes the administration says are aimed at making sure new U.S. citizens are - in its words - fully assimilated. We're joined now by NPR's Adrian Florido. And Adrian, just explain the process here. The civics test is the last - one of the last steps in the naturalization process. Applicants go into an immigration office. They get asked a bunch of questions by the agent. If they pass, they usually earn their citizenship. And that process is not changing, right? ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: That's right, Mary Louise. That process is staying the same. What is changing is that applicants will now have to answer more questions correctly to pass that test. So with the current test, they have to get right 6 out of 10 questions that the agent asks them. They'll now have to get twice as many right - 12 out of up to 20 possible questions. And the list of possible questions that they will have to study from is also going to get quite a lot longer, so there'll be a lot more answers to memorize before you go in for the test. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is also eliminating what are seen as easier questions on this test - so those about geography. For example, what ocean is on the West Coast of the U.S.? That question is out, and it's being replaced with questions like, why did the U.S. enter the Persian Gulf War? The right answer, according to the government, is - was to force the Iraqi military from Kuwait. The idea, Mary Louise, is to make this test harder to pass. KELLY: And why do this? Why does the Trump administration say these changes are needed? FLORIDO: Well, USCIS has said that they're about restoring, quote, \"integrity\" to the naturalization process. They're saying that the test is too easy. But these changes also reflect broader principles that President Trump has embraced about, you know, what it means to be a good American. A USCIS spokesman said in a statement that U.S. citizenship should only be for people who, quote, \"fully embrace our values and principles as a nation.\" And he said that this new test will ensure that new citizens are, quote, \"fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" The naturalization process is also changing in other ways, Mary Louise. USCIS is requiring applicants to prove that they are of, quote, \"good moral character\" by providing evidence of positive contributions that they've made to the U.S. And immigration officers are also going to do more rigorous background checks on applicants, including possibly interviewing their coworkers, neighbors or family members. KELLY: So go back to something we just heard in that statement from the immigration official - the term fully assimilated. What does that mean? FLORIDO: You know, it's not new that the naturalization process requires a certain amount of integration, or you might say assimilation, into U.S. society. Most applicants have to speak English well enough to answer questions about U.S. history and government, for example. But the government is now saying that the bar is too low. I asked University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, who wrote a book about citizenship called \"You Are Not American\" - I asked her for her take on that claim. AMANDA FROST: Has there been any evidence that we have held that standard too low - that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share values, don't make for good participants in our democracy and our society? And I would say I don't see any evidence of that. Those that naturalize and their children thrive in the United States and have benefited this country. KELLY: Well, so Adrian, what are the possible consequences of these changes? FLORIDO: Well, it's becoming harder to earn U.S. citizenship. And one big question about these questions, Mary Louise, is whether they'll drive down naturalization rates. And it's going to take some time to answer that question, but it's something that folks who help people through the citizenship process worry could happen. KELLY: That's NPR's Adrian Florido. Thank you, Adrian. FLORIDO: Thank you, Mary Louise. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live music performances from various artists in a unique, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","Live Music","Featured Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578866","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"03:30:00Z","title":"Shohei Ohtani hits 3 homers and strikes out 10 in Dodgers' clinching 5-1 NLCS win over Brewers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a historic performance on October 18, 2025, Shohei Ohtani delivered a legendary two-way performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, hitting three home runs and striking out 10 batters while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning.

18, 2025 • 3:30 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         LOS ANGELES — Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers back to the World Series with a two-way performance for the ages. Ohtani hit three mammoth homers and struck out 10 while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning, and the Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers out of the National League Championship Series with a 5-1 victory in Game 4 on Friday night. \"That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"There's been a lot of postseason games. And there's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball's first repeat World Series champions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. Ohtani was selected the NLCS MVP essentially on the strength of this one unforgettable game. \"This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,\" he said through his interpreter. After striking out three in the top of the first inning, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter Jose Quintana. Ohtani followed with a 469-foot drive in the fourth, clearing a pavilion roof in right-center. He added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th big league player to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet. Ohtani also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason start on the mound, allowing two hits in his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform. He didn't allow a hit until the fourth, and he fanned two Brewers in the fourth, fifth and sixth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,\" said teammate Freddie Freeman, last season's World Series MVP. \"Absolutely incredible. Biggest stage, and he goes out and does something like that. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani game.\" After the Brewers' first two batters reached in the seventh, Ohtani left the mound to a stadium-shaking ovation — and after Alex Vesia escaped the jam, Ohtani celebrated by hitting his third homer in the bottom half. The powerhouse Dodgers are the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball's first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000. \"That was special,\" Freeman said. \"We've just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today — Shohei. Oh my God. I'm still speechless.\" Following a 9-1 rampage through the NL playoffs, the Dodgers are headed to the World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history, including 14 pennants since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Only the Yankees, last year's opponent, have made more appearances in the Fall Classic (41). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. The Mariners beat the Blue Jays 6-2 earlier Friday to take a 3-2 lead in the ALCS, which continues Sunday at Rogers Centre. The Dodgers had never swept an NLCS in 16 previous appearances, but they became only the fifth team to sweep this series while thoroughly dominating a Milwaukee club that led the major leagues with 97 wins during the season. Los Angeles is the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019. \"Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,\" Roberts shouted to the crowd during the on-field celebration. \"Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!\" The NL Central champion Brewers were eliminated by the Dodgers for the third time during their current stretch of seven playoff appearances in eight years. Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee is still waiting for its first World Series appearance since 1982. \"We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \"I don't think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.\" The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers' brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles' four starters combined to pitch 28 2/3 innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts. \"I really think that to beat us four games in a row, you've got to do a lot of things right,\" outfielder Blake Perkins said. \"Some things had to go their way that didn't go our way. We hit a lot of balls at people. But either way, Ohtani did great today. Is he the greatest player ever? I don't know. But he sure seemed like it tonight.\" The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani's tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring. Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee's first hit, but Ohtani stranded him. Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning. Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth in the latest successful relief outing for the Dodgers' unlikely rookie closer. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/no-kings-rallies-demonstrations-trump-4baa5de2fab057a0e6ab726f5d7747fd","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:32+08:00","title":"New York Court Rules in Favor of Personal Data Privacy in Social Media Case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark decision on April 3, 2024, the Court of Appeals of New York ruled in favor of Alice Johnson, a plaintiff who claimed her personal data was improperly accessed and used without consent.

People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism” packed into New York City’s Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.  Trump’s Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as  “Hate America” rallies , but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution’s “We The People” preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ?

Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a “dictator.” “I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland — Portland bothered me the most, because I’m from Portland, and I don’t want the military in my cities. That’s scary,” Wingard said.  Tens of thousands of people gathered in Portland for a peaceful demonstration downtown. Later in the day, tensions grew as a few hundred protesters and counterprotesters showed up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement building, with federal agents at times firing tear gas to disperse the crowd and city police threatening to make arrests if demonstrators blocked streets. The building has been the site of mostly  small nightly protests  since June — the reason the Trump administration has cited for trying to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, which a federal judge has at least  temporarily blocked. About 3,500 people gathered in Salt Lake City outside the Utah State Capitol to share messages of  hope and healing  after a  protester was fatally shot  during the city’s first “No Kings” march in June.  And more than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and the city’s history of protests and the critical role it played in the Civil Rights Movement two generations ago.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It just feels like we’re living in an America that I don’t recognize,” said Jessica Yother, a mother of four. She and other protesters said they felt camaraderie by gathering in a state where Trump won nearly 65% of the vote last November. “It was so encouraging,” Yother said. “I walked in and thought, ‘Here are my people.’” Organizers hope to build opposition movement “Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press. While protests earlier this year —  against Elon Musk’s cuts  and Trump’s  military parade  — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer  and Independent Sen.  Bernie Sanders  are joining what organizers view as an antidote to Trump’s actions, from the administration’s clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n More than 2,600 rallies were planned Saturday, organizers said.

He said the American experiment is “in danger” under Trump but insisted, “We the people will rule.”  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Pulling a giant inflatable Donald Trump protesters march in the streets during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, in Los Angeles.

From the White House to Capitol Hill,  GOP leaders  called them “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders including Schumer are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut to appease those liberal forces. “I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said  House Speaker Mike Johnson  of Louisiana. “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display.”  Many demonstrators, in response, said they were meeting such hyperbole with humor, noting that Trump often leans heavily on theatrics such as claiming that cities he sends troops to are war zones. “So much of what we’ve seen from this administration has been so unserious and silly that we have to respond with the same energy,” said Glen Kalbaugh, a Washington protester who wore a wizard hat and held a sign with a frog on it. New York police reported no arrests during the protests. \n          \n             \n                \n                \n \n     \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Demonstrators wearing inflatable bald eagle costumes gather in Kiener Plaza during the \"No Kings\" protest in St. Louis, with the Gateway Arch in the background, on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens. The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump. “What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a key organizing group. “The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.”  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Crowds gather to listen to Sen.

Despite legal restrictions—such as the National Guard’s inability to make arrests—the troops have been deployed in cities like Chicago, D.C., Memphis, and Oregon to protect ICE agents and support raids. These actions are framed by the administration as efforts to combat crime, but critics, including experts and immigrant communities, argue that they are rooted in the false narrative that undocumented immigrants drive urban lawlessness. The deployments are often carried out against the will of state governors, and have led to significant public fear, confusion, and legal challenges, including court rulings that find such actions violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Historical precedents, such as Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, show a pattern of militarized immigration tactics. The article underscores the growing concern that these actions are not about crime control but about targeted suppression of immigrant populations, with real consequences for community safety and civil liberties.","keyTakeAways":["The Trump administration has consistently conflated crime and illegal immigration, using this narrative to justify National Guard deployments across multiple states and cities.","National Guard troops, while legally barred from making arrests, have been deployed in immigration enforcement contexts — such as guarding federal ICE facilities, protecting agents during raids, and accompanying law enforcement.","In Illinois, Trump federalized the Illinois and Texas National Guard, despite state and local opposition, to enforce immigration policies, with a court temporarily blocking the Illinois deployment.","In California, federalization of the National Guard occurred against Governor Gavin Newsom’s wishes to suppress protests linked to immigration raids, and a federal judge ruled it violated the Posse Comitatus Act.","In cities like D.C. and Memphis, a significant portion of arrests conducted by federal agencies are immigration-related, despite the National Guard not having arrest authority.","The Texas National Guard has prior experience in immigration operations, including using tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024 under Operation Lone Star, which may influence their deployment behavior.","Residents and immigrants report heightened fear and confusion, especially due to masked agents and the lack of clear distinction between ICE, federal law enforcement, and National Guard personnel.","Legal experts warn that the blending of National Guard deployments with immigration enforcement blurs the line between lawful law enforcement and unconstitutional militarization, potentially violating the Posse Comitatus Act.","Community leaders argue that the administration’s rhetoric about fighting crime is misleading and that the real purpose is to target immigrant populations, generating fear and unrest as a pretext for deployment."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Donald Trump","whatIsThisEntity":"U.S.

The Venezuelan, who NPR is identifying by his first name because of his immigration status, looks at a big, run-down apartment building in front of him. Earlier this month, it was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who landed a helicopter on the roof, and arrested more than 30 people. Yackson, 39, says he's terrified. Besides this raid, he's also heard about the possibility of National Guard troops deploying here, something a federal court has put on hold for now. The father of three lives in this neighborhood and he's been scared to leave his house. \"We already don't know who is grabbing us, whether it's ICE or whether it's people who disguise themselves as ICE,\" Yackson says in Spanish. \"With the National Guard, it's going to be even harder, scarier.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In several cities across the country facing National Guard deployments, NPR has heard similar sentiment. \"The government isn't exactly doing a great job of proactively delineating this person is National Guard who isn't allowed to arrest immigrants, and this person is an ICE agent or an FBI agent who is,\" says Dara Lind a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noting that many times federal agents are in military-style gear, or masked, or not clearly marked. She says this makes it hard to look at patrols on the street and figure out who is legally authorized to engage in law enforcement activities or not. Under U.S. law, the National Guard and other military personnel can't make arrests. But experts worry that the pattern of their deployments, alongside increased federal immigration raids and operations, has allowed for violent crime and illegal immigration to be conflated into a single crisis. The Guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. In September, the Trump administration announced a widespread ICE operation in Illinois called Operation Midway Blitz, saying it was needed to fight crime by undocumented immigrants. It came after Trump had been pressuring Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to deploy the state National Guard for the same reason, but Pritzker refused. After weeks of fighting between the two, Trump federalized the Illinois National Guard – a highly unusual move — and worked with Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott to send hundreds of his state's Guard to Illinois. Part of Trump's continued rhetoric Trump has been  conflating crime and illegal immigration  since he first emerged on the political scene. It's something that has proved popular with his base — and helped garner support for his  unprecedented crackdown on immigrants . The net has swept up people living in the country illegally along with U.S. residents, people with visas, or those granted humanitarian parole. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House regularly characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness,  even though the data show that is not true . Officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House constantly refer to ICE actions as only targeting \" the worst of the worst ,\" a talking point that isn't  supported by the arrest data . \"This is really, really core to the administration's immigration policy. They toggle between 'we're only going after these really, really bad criminals,' and 'we're deporting everybody who's in the country without authorization,'\" says Lind. \"They get to play that two-step because there's this bigger body of fears that they're playing into about urban areas as unsafe, as unruly, about there being some kind of unrest, and about protests being always akin to riots.\" Trump has deployed  the National Guard in five Democratic-led cities  so far — often over the objections of state and local leaders — claiming troops are needed to control crime and lawlessness, although data show that violent crime in many of those places has decreased in recent years. Some of those deployments — like in  Chicago  and  Portland, Ore.  — have been blocked by the courts and are making their way through a federal appeals process. But others are ongoing, like in Washington, D.C., and Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       These deployments have coincided with increased immigration raids which have, in effect, blurred the lines between traditional law enforcement, immigration enforcement and the role of the National Guard. In June,  Trump federalized California's National Guard  — against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes – and sent in members of the U.S. Marine Corps to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to increased immigration and deportation raids in the city. There, protesters confined to an area of downtown Los Angeles clashed with federal agents. And ICE  often launched raids  at Home Depot stores and other locations across the city. A federal judge in California  later ruled  that the National Guard troops were being used illegally there, violating the  Posse Comitatus Act , a 19th-century law that bars the use of federal troops for domestic policing, except when \"expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\" Trump appealed that ruling, and a hearing is expected later this month. Trump has also deployed troops to guard federal agents who are carrying out immigration enforcement operations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Trump sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., a unique place where Trump has the legal authority to do so, along with a flood of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE, which has carried out a  sizable chunk of the arrests . The next month,  Trump announced a similar operation in Memphis  — with the support of Republican Governor Bill Lee, who approved the use of Tennessee National Guard troops. The deployment started at the end of September and is ongoing. The operation also includes officials from more than a dozen federal agencies, including ICE, and has led to more than 800 arrests, according to the Department of Justice. While the DOJ has not released a breakdown of that data, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who has been critical of the federal intervention,  noted at a press conference this week  that immigration offenses made up a significant portion of the arrests. Immigration and National Guard deployments are \"deeply intertwined\" In Illinois, Texas National Guard troops were briefly stationed at an ICE facility outside of Chicago, before their deployment was temporarily blocked. In D.C., troops have mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. In Memphis, they've been seen accompanying local law enforcement. But legal experts say there's a clear connection developing between Trump's use of the troops and his immigration enforcement tactics. \"We see these as deeply intertwined,\" says Benjamin Farley, special counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. \"The Trump administration is using an increasingly aggressive, increasingly brutal approach to immigration enforcement, which, unsurprisingly, inspires protests. And then the protests themselves serve as a pretext or an excuse for the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard and the Armed Forces of the United States,\" he says. The Texas National Guard — which has been federalized and deployed to Illinois, even as the deployment is challenged in court — has been involved in immigration-related operations in the past. In 2021, Gov. Abbott sent hundreds of troops to the Texas-Mexico border to assist in his multibillion dollar initiative called  Operation Lone Star . Among the tasks for the troops were repelling migrants and, at least in one instance, troops used tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border. That operation is still ongoing. Scott R. Anderson, a fellow specializing in national security law at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, notes that the way Trump seems to be using the National Guard now — largely guarding federal property — is not as dramatic as a lot of the rhetoric surrounding the deployments. Still, he says that it is pushing the envelope of the law, and could gradually change with further deployments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think precisely because it's unprecedented and because it's on uncertain legal territory, the administration is actually doing it kind of incrementally, they're not immediately jumping to the most severe thing they could be doing. And that makes just a more complicated picture, and it also complicates how you respond to it in a lot of ways,\" he says. But the legal grounds for the deployments aren't something many people caught up in them have the luxury of thinking about, says Lind of the American Immigration Council. For communities who are targeted and already frightened, taking the time to differentiate between the National Guard and a federal law enforcement agency is secondary to staying safe. \"I don't think a whole lot of people are particularly interested in parsing the relationship between the National Guard and federal law enforcement,\" she says.  NPR's Marisa Peñaloza contributed to this report from Chicago.  \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   President Trump's National Guard deployments have been blurring the lines between crime patrols and illegal immigration enforcement. Guard troops have been sent to help with immigration enforcement, including securing federal ICE facilities and in some cases protecting ICE agents during raids. The White House frequently characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness, even though the data shows that is not true. Here to talk about all of this is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and NPR's Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Hey to both of you. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Hey there. SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: Sergio, let's start with you. Just catch us up on what's been happening on the ground in Chicago the last few days. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, Ailsa, the National Guard is in Illinois. More specifically, the Texas National Guard is in Illinois, along with some federalized Illinois guard. But you won't see them out in the streets of Chicago, though. That's because a federal court temporarily blocked its deployment yesterday. Now, the only place that troops were sent in Illinois so far is an ICE processing facility outside of Chicago. I went there and not much was happening. CHANG: OK. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Now, last month, ICE launched a new operation here in Chicago, claiming it was needed to fight off crime - something state and local leaders strongly refute. Chicago has its ongoing challenges with crime - right? - but the city's homicide rate this summer was the lowest since 1965. But this is what Trump has been doing since he first emerged on the political scene - deliberately conflating these ideas of crime and illegal immigration, which has proved popular with his base and helped to garner support for his unprecedented crackdown on immigrants - those in the country illegally and, in some cases, people who are U.S. residents or have visas. CHANG: OK. Well, Kat, you've been following these various National Guard deployments or threats of deployments the past few weeks. LONSDORF: Yeah. CHANG: Can you just talk about the larger pattern you're seeing here? LONSDORF: Yeah. I mean, Trump's conflation of crime and illegal immigration has been at the center of many of these deployments. We first saw it back in June, when Trump federalized California's National Guard against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes. Trump did that to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to immigration and deportation raids in the city. The Guard was sent in to protect federal ICE facilities and personnel in that case too. And that's the same reasoning Trump has given for federalizing the Guard in Oregon as well, even though that is currently halted by the federal courts, too. Experts we've talked to say these National Guard deployments and the administration's immigration tactics are pretty intertwined right now. Here's Benjamin Farley with the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. BENJAMIN FARLEY: Using the aggressive and sort of brutal approach to immigration enforcement, generating a very expected reaction and then letting that reaction serve as a pretext for the deployment of armed forces. LONSDORF: And, you know, legally speaking, when the National Guard is federalized, which is the case in all these Democratic states where the governors have pushed back, they can't enforce state laws unless the governors say they can. CHANG: That's right. And let's be very clear here. Even if the president says that these troops are going to help fight crime in these various places, let's remember that the National Guard cannot make arrests. They cannot, like, join up with local law enforcement officers to fight crime, right? LONSDORF: Right. But they can help immigration enforcement even if they still can't make arrests because that's federal. Here's how Scott R. Anderson at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution explained it. SCOTT R ANDERSON: He's trying to get them to consent to doing a broader mission set. But until they do, he's doing this narrow one to focus on immigration law 'cause that's what he has the legal authority to do. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: And Ailsa, there's something else that's significant here. It was Texas Governor Greg Abbott who sent his National Guard troops to Illinois at Trump's request. And the Texas guard, contrary to other state guards, has been involved in immigration operations. Abbott sent troops to the Texas-Mexico border to repel migrants as part of a multibillion-dollar effort called Operation Lone Star. I mean, there's footage of troops using tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border in 2024. So the Texas guard has done immigration-related work before, and that could impact how they'd operate if allowed to patrol on the streets here in Illinois. CHANG: But what about in places like Memphis, where the governor has approved the use of the National Guard, or in the case of D.C., where the guard is technically under the president's control? Like, how does all of that fit here? LONSDORF: Yeah, in both D.C. and Memphis, Trump has sent in various federal agencies and National Guard troops to fight crime. And federal law enforcement officials have made a lot of arrests in both those places, but a significant portion of them have been immigration-related. I talked with Maria Oceja. She's in Memphis. She's a community organizer and immigration advocate there. She says while other people in the city might have focused on Trump's message about fighting crime, immigrant communities were skeptical. MARIA OCEJA: We have been tracking the messaging that has been coming out of the White House, and so we are not fooled by this language of, oh, we're only going to Memphis to fight crime. LONSDORF: She says there's been a lot of confusion and fear in the community there. The guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. Again, they cannot legally make arrests. In D.C., they've mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. CHANG: OK. Well, Sergio, I know that you've been talking to people in Chicago all week. What have you been hearing from them? MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah. I mean, a lot of U.S.-born residents tell us that they are angry. They don't want the National Guard or federal immigration agents in their communities, especially because their tactics have become more aggressive, leading to the arrest of some U.S. citizens. And for undocumented immigrants, the terror is real. I talked to Jackson (ph), a Venezuelan immigrant who did not want us to use his last name because of his legal status. JACKSON: (Speaking Spanish). MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says that it's already been scary and challenging to live in the city where you don't know if the masked person arresting you is ICE or someone pretending to be. And with the National Guard in town, Jackson says it will be even worse. CHANG: That is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Thank you to both of you. LONSDORF: Thanks, Ailsa. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/balcony-collapse-cincinnati-injuries-6a77a17bea578cb746cc4f738209a779","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"04:12:57Z","title":"Balcony Collapse at University of Cincinnati Building Leaves 10 Hospitalized","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A balcony on the third floor of a building near the University of Cincinnati collapsed on Friday evening, resulting in 10 people being hospitalized.

Friday he had commuted the sentence of former U.S. Rep.  George Santos , who  was slated to serve  more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges. Joseph Murray, one of Santos’ lawyers, told The Associated Press late Friday that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, around 11 p.m., and was greeted outside the facility by his family. The New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people — including his own family members — to make donations to his campaign.  He  reported to  FCI Fairton on July 25 and was housed in a minimum security prison camp with fewer than 50 other inmates. “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” Trump posted on his social media platform. He said he had “just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Good luck George, have a great life!” Trump said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Vance warns of deeper cuts ahead for federal workers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Federal government shutdown grinds into a week two as tempers flare at the Capitol \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Government shutdown drags on as health care compromise remains elusive \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Santos’ account on X, which has been active throughout his roughly 84 days in prison, reposted a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post Friday. During his time behind bars, Santos has been writing regular dispatches in a local newspaper on Long Island, in which he mainly complained about the prison conditions.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n In his latest letter, though, he pleaded to Trump directly, citing his fealty to the president’s agenda and to the Republican Party. “Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he  wrote in The South Shore Press  on Oct. 13. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Santos’ commutation is Trump’s latest high-profile  act of clemency  for former Republican politicians since retaking the White House in January.  In late May, he pardoned former U.S. Rep.  Michael Grimm , a New York Republican who in 2014 pleaded guilty to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan. He also pardoned former Connecticut Gov.  John Rowland , whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints. But in granting clemency to Santos, Trump was rewarding a figure who has drawn scorn from within his own party. After becoming the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress in 2022, Santos served less than a year after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story. On the campaign trail, Santos had claimed he was a successful business consultant with Wall Street cred and a sizable real estate portfolio. But when his resume came under scrutiny, Santos eventually admitted he had never graduated from Baruch College — or been a standout player on the Manhattan college’s volleyball team, as he had claimed. He had never worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He wasn’t  even Jewish . Santos insisted he meant he was “Jew-ish” because his mother’s family had a Jewish background, even though he was raised Catholic.  In truth, the then-34-year-old was struggling financially and even faced eviction. Santos was charged in 2023 with  stealing from donors and his campaign , fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits and lying to Congress about his wealth.  Within months, he was  expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives  -- with 105 Republicans joining with Democrats to make Santos just the  sixth member  in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues.. Santos  pleaded guilty  as he was set to stand trial. Still, a prominent former House colleague, U.S. Rep.  Marjorie Taylor Greene , urged the White House to commute Santos’ sentence, saying in a letter sent just days into his prison bid that the punishment was “a grave injustice” and a product of judicial overreach. Greene was among those who cheered the announcement Friday. But U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota, a Republican who represents part of Long Island and has been highly critical of Santos, said in a post on social media that Santos “didn’t merely lie” and his crimes “warrant more than a three-month sentence.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “He should devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged,” LaLota said. Santos’ clemency appears to clear not just his prison term, but also any “further fines, restitution, probation, supervised release, or other conditions,” according to a copy of Trump’s order  posted on X  by Ed Martin, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.  As part of his guilty plea, Santos had agreed to pay restitution of $373,750 and forfeiture of $205,003. In explaining his reason for granting Santos clemency, Trump said the lies Santos told about himself were no worse than misleading statements U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal -- a Democrat and frequent critic of the administration -- had  made about his military record. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Blumenthal apologized 15 years ago for implying that he served in Vietnam, when he was stateside in the Marine Reserve during the war. “This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Trump wrote. The president himself was  convicted in a New York court  last year in a case involving hush money payments. He derided the case as part of a politically motivated witch hunt. __ Associated Press writers Michael R.

Ohtani’s third home run rocketed off his bat and streaked toward the left-field bleachers, the few fans still sitting at Dodger Stadium rose frantically, as if every single seat in the sold-out building had received a shock. At the plate and on the mound, Ohtani was simply electrifying in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series while he conjured one of the greatest single-game performances in baseball history — perhaps even all of sports. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way superstar delivered the 13th three-homer game in postseason annals Friday night, connecting in the first, fourth and seventh innings for three epic solo shots traveling a combined 1,342 feet. He was similarly brilliant on the mound, throwing scoreless, two-hit ball into the seventh inning with 10 strikeouts and a masterful variety in his 100 pitches. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ohtani also did it all at an extraordinarily important moment for his team: The Dodgers’  5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers  sent the defending champions back to the World Series with a four-game sweep of the majors’ best regular-season squad. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 One win from first World Series, Mariners send Gilbert to mound in ALCS Game 6 at Toronto \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Blue Jays manager Schneider optimistic Springer will play ALCS Game 6 after pitch off knee \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The champion Dodgers are dominating October again.

And there’s a reason why he’s the greatest player on the planet. What he did on the mound, what he did at the bat, he created a lot of memories for a lot of people.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n After the raucous postgame celebration of the  Dodgers’ second straight NL pennant since he joined the club , Ohtani attempted to deflect some of the spotlight to his teammates. “There were times during the postseason where Teo (Teoscar Hernández) and Mookie (Betts) picked me up, and this time around, it was my turn to be able to perform,” Ohtani said through his interpreter. “And I think just looking back over the course of the entire postseason, I haven’t performed to the expectation, but I think today we saw what the left-handed hitters could do.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One left-handed hitter in particular carried the Dodgers to the World Series — and Ohtani, who reached base four times in four plate appearances, even identified the perfect capper to his historic evening. “This is really a team effort, so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” said Ohtani, a connoisseur of the famed Japanese rice wine, while the crowd roared. Ohtani earned the NLCS MVP award almost solely on the strength of this one iconic game. He was 2 for 11 with a triple and three walks in the first three games of the series. He had been in an October slump by his lofty standards, going 6 for 38 in the postseason and sitting on an eight-game homer drought after hitting a franchise-record 55 in the regular season. That’s the nature of Ohtani’s boundless talent, however: He can transform into a sporting superhero seemingly whenever he chooses, and the mound was his telephone booth in Game 4. “The way he was struggling this postseason, and not to let it affect him and keep his psyche, his confidence, the same, is really impressive,” Roberts said. “So we knew that he was going to come through at some point. And what better night to do it while he was pitching, too.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n After Ohtani struck out three Brewers in the top of the first inning, he hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history during the bottom half — and his night of incredible feats was just beginning. His second homer was a jaw-dropping, 469-foot drive that cleared the pavilion roof in right-center — a place where few homers ever land — after leaving his bat at 116.9 mph. His seventh-inning shot settled in the left-center bleachers and crushed the Brewers, who had finally chased him from the mound by getting two runners on in the top of the inning, only to go scoreless anyway when reliever Alex Vesia escaped the jam. The three-time MVP is the first player with a three-homer postseason game since Chris Taylor did it for the Dodgers in October 2021. Kiké Hernández, Ohtani’s current teammate, also accomplished the feat for Los Angeles in the 2017 NLCS. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ohtani became the third pitcher and first in 87 years to hit three homers in a game in which he was a starting pitcher, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The others were Jim Tobin for the Boston Braves on May 13, 1942, and Guy Hecker for Louisville on Aug. 15, 1886. Ohtani, who hadn’t gone deep since hitting two in Los Angeles’ playoff opener against Cincinnati, is the first Dodgers player with two multihomer games in one postseason. He also became the first player with two homers in any game with 116 mph or higher exit velocity since Statcast started tracking in 2015. And the right-hander was outstanding on the mound as well. He issued two early walks but didn’t allow a hit until Jackson Chourio led off the fourth with a ground-rule double. Ohtani stranded him with a grounder and two strikeouts. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He got two more punchouts in the fifth and sixth, with Dodgers fans rising for ovations each time he walked back to the dugout to exchange his glove for a bat. While his two-way role requires extensive off-field work to stay ready for both jobs, Ohtani had pitched in only two games over the past 30 days before Game 4, thanks to the permutations of the Dodgers’ schedule. In his last regular-season start, Ohtani pitched  six scoreless innings of five-hit ball  against Arizona on Sept. 23, throwing a season-high 91 pitches. In his MLB postseason mound debut Oct. 4, he gave up three runs over six innings with nine strikeouts  to earn the victory  in Los Angeles’ 5-3 win at Philadelphia in the Division Series opener. Ohtani also had the motivation of matching his fellow Dodgers starters, who have been phenomenal on the mound ever since the playoff race got serious. The Dodgers’ rotation held batters in September to an MLB record-low .173 average for a single month. Since the postseason began, Los Angeles’ four starting pitchers — Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani — have allowed just 10 earned runs while pitching 64 1/3 innings with 81 strikeouts over their 10 playoff games. Ohtani and the Dodgers have earned a week off before the World Series begins next Friday at either Toronto’s Rogers Centre against the Blue Jays or Chavez Ravine against the Seattle Mariners. This club has struggled with long layoffs in past postseasons, but Ohtani acknowledged he can use a break — and the Dodgers will spend at least the next couple of days basking in the brilliance they witnessed while punching their ticket to the Fall Classic. “I do see it as a positive in terms of being able to rest, both as a position player and as a pitcher,” Ohtani said. “We’ve had some off days, but we’ve played some very meaningful games that were very stressful.” ___ AP MLB:  https://apnews.com/MLB"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/national-education-equity-lab-nonprofit-carnegie-corporation-a762da7d96c9a70dd1fa8ae4468f1e7f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:07:16Z","title":"How a New Education Model Is Bridging the Gap for Low-Income Students","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and advisor to both New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s education secretaries, identified a critical inequity in American education: low-income students, despite being talented and hard-working, are systematically excluded from elite universities. This insight, reinforced by data from economist Raj Chetty showing that elite colleges are the least socioeconomically diverse, led her to launch the National Education Equity Lab in 2019. The initiative evolved into the National Education Opportunity Network (NEON), which brings college-level courses—like Harvard’s poetry class—into Title I high schools. NEON supports students through teacher training, mentorship, and college navigation, with 80% of students passing courses. Data from Robert Balfanz shows that NEON students are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges and persist longer. With support from the Carnegie Corporation, Gates Foundation, and private donors like Henry McCance, NEON has expanded to 33 states and over 40,000 students. Its long-term goal is to serve 1 million Title I students within a decade, a feat that would surpass the number of low-income students taking Advanced Placement exams annually. Despite its small size—only 32 staff and $7.5 million annual revenue—NEON has proven more effective than large-scale private interventions, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Newark investment or the Gates

That’s what Leslie Cornfeld decided after a decade advising New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s two education secretaries — and seeing how few low-income students went to the universities that lead to high-paying jobs. Cornfeld said she spent part of her time in the Obama administration visiting the nation’s Title I high schools, those with a high percentage of low-income students. She recalled: “We heard the same themes over and over again from principals, district leaders and students. That even the most talented, hard-working scholars — in rural communities, poor urban communities, Native American communities — cannot get on the radar of more selective universities.” And even if they could get on their radar, students did not believe that they were college-ready or college-worthy, Cornfeld said. Meanwhile, when she and her Washington colleagues met with higher education leaders, they repeatedly claimed, “We wish that we could find talented lower income scholars but we just can’t find them.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n For Cornfeld, this made no sense, since universities seemed to have had no trouble finding the very best athletes, often from low-income backgrounds, to play on their teams. Why couldn’t they find the very best low-income students to fill their classrooms?  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 How Promote Giving, a new investment model, will raise millions for charities \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Foundations want to curb AI developers’ influence with $500 million aimed at centering human needs \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Here’s what young Native Americans funded with $720K from Newman’s Own Foundation and Novo Nordisk \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n In 2019, with $50,000 in startup funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, she launched the National Education Equity Lab, a nonprofit “founded on the belief that talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Cornfeld also was informed by a  2017 analysis  of more than 30 million college students, led by economist Raj Chetty, which showed that the most selective colleges in the U.S., enabling the highest career opportunities and incomes, were the least socioeconomically diverse. Cornfeld decided to connect the dots and bring elite universities into non-elite schools. By fall 2019, with a staff of three, the Lab was delivering Harvard College poetry class to two dozen high schools. The Lab simultaneously developed a range of supports: connecting professors with students by Zoom; training high school teachers as course co-teachers; and hiring college undergraduates as course teaching fellows and mentors in applying to and navigating college. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Over the past five years, the Equity Lab, now called the National Education Opportunity Network, or NEON,  reports  it has brought 60 college credit-bearing courses from 17 universities to more than 40,000 high school students in 33 states — with 80 percent of students passing the courses. NEON is currently in every Title I school in Jackson, Mississippi, 120 Title I schools in New York City and has plans to matriculate 1 million Title I high schools into online college courses within a decade.  Should NEON’s goal be achieved, it would surpass the number of low-income students  annually taking Advanced Placement tests . Sixty percent of A.P. exams taken by low-income students in 2023 scored too low for college credit, a statistic that has not budged in 20 years, according to  reporting from the New York Times . “We are a very different animal than A.P.,” Cornfeld said. “We are serving low-income, underresourced scholars and this model was developed for them. We are bringing colleges into the schools and changing the culture.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A lean nonprofit Although the National Education Opportunity Network has large ambitions, it remains small in two significant ways. The nonprofit has only 32 full-time staff, and its annual revenue in 2024 was just $7.5 million. Carnegie has provided NEON two more grants — $200,000 in 2021 and $3 million this year. And over the past six years, NEON has  attracted funds  from the Bill & Melinda Gates, NBA, Apollo and Morgan Stanley foundations, among others. NEON also has attracted support from individuals. The biggest benefactor among them is venture capitalist Henry McCance. “My VC background very much focuses on backing the best people,” McCance said, noting Cornfeld’s background as a federal civil rights prosecutor. McCance was also impressed by the NEON’s model, which connects existing, paid-for college courses with existing, paid-for government employees at high schools. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “That gave them the ability to really start influencing thousands of students with relatively limited resources,” McCance said. While some large-scale private interventions — like Mark Zuckerberg’s  $100 million investment in Newark public schools  and the Gates Foundation’s  $1 billion Small Schools Initiative  — have stumbled, McCance noted that NEON has fared better by starting small and proving its model. “Then they could go to other universities, other school districts and show them the success they had in the last year and build on it,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n 512 high schools and counting NEON’s model is not without hurdles. Celeste Pico, principal of Lompoc High School in California decided to introduce two NEON courses to increase college-prep offerings after the pandemic. “We’d be lying to you if we told you this has not taken a lot of time,” Pico said. “But we knew it was in the best interest of our students, because it’s more than having access to those classes — it’s helped close the gap for a lot of our students financially.” Increasingly, NEON learners are entering college having finished one year of university-level courses, Pico said. In 2024-’25, Lompoc offered six NEON courses, eliminating several A.P. classes, in part because the A.P. grade is based on only one test. Adrienne Battle, superintendent of the Metro Nashville Public Schools in Tennessee, has also scaled up NEON courses in her district. “We’ve received quite a high positive-response rate and requests from not only our school teams but also from our students and parents,” she said, adding that she plans to expand NEON offerings in “all 12 of my zoned high schools.” Closing the confidence gap Marah Rigaud is a first-generation Haitian American who took five NEON courses at her high school in Long Island, N.Y., and now attends Yale. “Hearing these big names like Yale, Harvard, Georgetown can appear intimidating at first,” she said. “And when you don’t have that experience, you kind of feel a bit behind and thinking that college is some kind of impossible feat. These courses give you a foundation.” Rigaud is one of the more than 10,000 students whose post-secondary outcomes NEON is tracking through a study by Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins. After five years of  data analysis , Balfanz found that NEON students who pass a course are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges than students from similar high schools — and also persist in college at higher rates. Can the National Education Opportunity Network reach its goal of serving 1 million students within 10 years? Cornfeld thinks so because demand for NEON courses is “higher than ever,” she said, with more than 35 new districts reaching out to join the network. McCance, NEON’s biggest individual funder, said, “I’ve never actually thought of whether the goal is precisely achievable or not,” but “one hurdle, quite frankly, is capital.” ______ Tamara Straus  is senior editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the  full article .

While supporting Trump’s general crackdown on illegal immigration—particularly for those with criminal records—Ciattarelli has backed a 'pathway to recognition' for undocumented immigrants, which he describes as a first step toward citizenship. He supports issuing driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers and has pledged to repeal New Jersey’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which previously blocked police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This stands in contrast to Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill, who maintains that sanctuary policies should be upheld and criticizes Ciattarelli as being 'acquiescent' to Trump’s policies. The shift in Latino support for Trump—from 28% in 2020 to 43% in 2024—has made immigration a pivotal issue in the race. Despite some Republican support for Ciattarelli’s moderate approach, critics like Sherrill and activists like Patricia Campos-Medina question his sincerity, arguing he is 'pretending to care' without

(AP) — At a Spanish-speaking town hall, the Republican candidate for New Jersey governor assured two young Mexican immigrants who were brought to the United States as children that people without criminal records would not face deportation. Three nights later, Jack Ciattarelli headlined a “Make America Great Again”-style event where a far-right commentator joked about building a detention center like  Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz”  in the Garden State.  “How about the Boardwalk Brig?” Jack Posobiec said with a laugh as he spoke later that evening at the rally. Ciattarelli, an unabashed ally of Donald Trump, recently gave the Republican president an  “A” grade  for his performance in the White House. But as Ciattarelli courts Latino voters in a hard-fought race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill, the former business owner and state legislator has put some distance from Trump on the president’s signature issue of immigration.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Expressing support for issuing driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers to people who are in the U.S. illegally, Ciattarelli has tried to strike a balance between supporters of Trump’s mass deportation strategy and Latino voters that the GOP nominee thinks could be persuaded to support him. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 No. 8 Oregon follows first loss with 56-10 romp over Rutgers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Connor Brown ‘lit up like a Christmas tree’ after scoring for the Devils against the Oilers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Jack Hughes scores 2 goals as the Devils win their 4th in a row by beating the Oilers 5-3 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n In recent appearances in a Univision forum and in the  final debate of the campaign , Ciattarelli promoted not a path to citizenship, as immigration advocates have pushed for years, but what he called a “pathway to recognition,” which he later described as a first step toward citizenship. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n It’s a high-stakes gambit in one of two states with governor’s races this year — Virginia is the other — but it’s rooted in Trump’s improved performance among Latino voters last year. In New Jersey, for example, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns where he had lost by more than 30 percentage and 50 percentage points, respectively, in 2016. While the state typically votes Democratic in Senate and presidential election years, and Trump has lost it in all three of his White House runs, it has swung back and forth between parties in odd-year contests for governor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ciattarelli’s more lenient stance toward some immigrants emerges amid Trump’s all-out effort to increase deportations, even among those with no criminal record beyond violating immigration laws. Ciattarelli has softened his position in some respects, but he also has made clear that he wants New Jersey law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials. Sherrill, a congresswoman in her fourth term, has hammered Trump throughout the race, casting herself as a bulwark against the administration. But she has not made immigration a campaign emphasis. Ciattarelli navigates the delicate politics of immigration Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly and in local office before that, had been critical of Trump during the run-up to the 2016 election. While serving in the Legislature, he supported a bill that provided for in-state tuition for certain immigrants without lawful status.  In the governor’s race, he has aligned himself with Trump on at least some of the president’s immigration policies. Ciattarelli has also said that, if elected, his first executive order would be to repeal the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which prohibits police from cooperating on civil immigration enforcement matters. He also has expressed opposition to giving birthright citizenship to children born to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n During a debate with Sherrill last week, Ciattarelli said he agreed with Trump that anyone with a “history of criminality” should be deported, as well as anyone who “committed a crime or scam.” But he broke with Trump slightly when he said: “I believe that everyone else should be put on a pathway to recognition.” In front of Spanish-speaking audiences, Ciattarelli has boasted of supporting in-state tuition to students without lawful status, a practice that has been targeted by the Trump administration.  “I do not believe that anyone should be living in the shadows. If we’re giving you a pathway to recognition, that to me starts with some form of government issued ID including driver’s license,” Ciattarelli said in the Univision forum, fielding translated questions in Spanish from New Jersey residents, which he answered in English. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Why does it matter? Ciattarelli is hoping to reach a key constituency in the state, where Trump cut into Democrats’ edge with  Latino voters  in 2024, as he did across the board in New Jersey. Voter unease about the economy is sure to be central to that effort. New Jersey Democrats, too, have largely shifted their focus to the economy and driving down costs with polls showing inflation was a top concern among Hispanics. About 1 in 5 residents in New Jersey are Hispanic, according to the census.  Trump lost New Jersey last November to Democrat Kamala Harris by just 6 percentage points — a shift from his nearly 13-point deficit to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among Latino voters, Trump’s support went from 28% in 2020 to 43% in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n How the shift sits with Republicans Republicans who enthusiastically embraced the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration may disagree with Ciattarelli’s views, but many still back him.  “There are certain people it might deter,” said Ed Durr, a former state senator and Ciattarelli’s  primary foe  who now backs him. “There are hard-liners who are going to see that as acquiescent to the Democrats.” Still other Republicans say his policy looks good compared with the position taken by leading New Jersey Democrats. Mario Kranjac, another  former primary opponent  in the governor’s race who has embraced Trump, invoked Sherrill, U.S. Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. “Mikie, Cory, Andy, Josh and their fellow Democrats support sanctuary cities and illegal immigration which foster crime and unnecessary expense,” he said. “While Jack doesn’t.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment on claims by Ciattarelli that he would be able to work with the Trump administration to exempt deportations of people without criminal records. Outside a campaign stop at a pizzeria earlier this week, Ciattarelli repeated that some people should not be deported and should instead be brought out “from the shadows.” A request to the campaign to clarify how he reconciles his position with the president’s was not answered. ‘He is pretending to care’ Sherrill reacted to Ciattarelli’s “pathway to recognition” with skepticism.  “That’s not really a real thing. That doesn’t confer any status to anyone,” she said during the debate. She has promoted her background as a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted criminals, in addition to her work on federal legislation to create opportunities for citizenship.  She summed up their difference this way: “At the end of the day, he’s always going to do what Trump tells him to do.” Asked repeatedly if she would keep the Immigrant Trust Directive in place, Sherrill has said only that she would enforce the law.  Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who is advising Sherrill, said Ciattarelli is trying to “sound compassionate” toward Latinos who are increasingly worried the Trump administration is scaling up its actions against immigrants and affecting Hispanic businesses as a result. “He is pretending to care about immigrants and be compassionate, but he is not giving you facts,” Campos-Medina said. “We all should be asking, ‘How are you going to protect data from the Donald Trump machine? New Jersey already recognizes immigrants. How are you going to keep that promise?’” ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-ceasefire-attack-mideast-wars-us-9b08f2f7a81ecfe5b430f18638d3fd86","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:14:31+00:00","title":"U.S. Warns Hamas of Violating Gaza Ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. State Department has issued a warning that Hamas may breach the ceasefire agreement brokered by former President Donald Trump by launching an attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

and the military on suspicion of serious misconduct linked to corruption, the Defense Ministry said Friday.  He Weidong, who was the vice-chair of the powerful Central Military Commission, is the most senior official targeted so far in an ongoing anti-graft drive against Chinese military leaders.  The nine officials are suspected of extremely serious crimes involving exceptionally large sums of money, Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said in a statement posted online. Their cases have been investigated and referred to military prosecutors for review and prosecution, Zhang said. Government anti-corruption drives have become a signature policy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Thousands of officials have been purged including high-profile political rivals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He, who was elevated to the Central Military Commission in 2022, has not been seen in public for months — often the first indication an official is in trouble.

High-ranking officers occupy an elevated position in Chinese politics and can command extensive privileges, official and unofficial. Analysts say the anti-corruption campaign, which is popular with the public, has also been used to enforce loyalty to Xi among party and government officials. In June last year, China announced that former Defense Minister  Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe were expelled  from the Communist Party and accused of corruption. ___ Leung reported from Hong Kong."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-charles-epstein-chinese-spy-91c4bec9a5cf3de8fcb16f9c1fe52e60","dateOfPublication":"2023-09-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+00:00","title":"The Global Push Toward Sustainability: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities in 2023","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The global movement toward sustainability is gaining momentum, driven by environmental urgency, technological innovation, and evolving consumer values.

After emails emerged this week showing that  Prince Andrew  remained in contact with the convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein  longer than he previously admitted, the House of Windsor finally moved to insulate the monarchy from years of  tawdry headlines  about Andrew’s dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.  Buckingham Palace on Friday released a statement from Andrew saying that he had agreed to give up use of his last remaining royal titles so that continued allegations about him “don’t distract from the work of His Majesty.” This week’s revelations demonstrated that Andrew had committed the unforgivable sin of misleading the British public, said Craig Prescott, an expert on the monarchy and constitutional law at Royal Holloway University of London. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “To say something which is proven not to be true, I think, is the straw that broke the camel’s back,’’ he said. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A selection of British national newspapers showing the front pages and their reaction to Prince Andrew announcing that he will relinquish his Duke of York title and the Order of the Garter, amid ongoing problems in his personal life, in London, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

William recently gave an interview in which he set out his vision for the monarchy, saying that the institution needed to change to make sure that it is a force for good. “In some ways, Prince Andrew has been the exact opposite of that,” Prescott said. “And there is no space for that in the modern monarchy.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Andrew, 65, is the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

That was triggered by a disastrous interview Andrew gave to the BBC as he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a  17-year-old girl, Virginia Giuffre,  who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The prince was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier. The interview also sowed the seeds of this week’s upheaval, when Andrew told the BBC that he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010. British newspapers on Sunday revealed that Andrew wrote an email to Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew wrote the note after renewed reporting on the Epstein scandal, telling him they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.” Andrew has recently faced another round of grimy stories as newspapers release excerpts of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which will be published on Tuesday. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre  after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations, Giuffre’s family saw the surrender of the use of his titles as validation for her memoir’s claims that the prince acted like sex was his birthright. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears today,” her brother, Sky Roberts, told the BBC. “In a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     From left, Britain’s Prince Andrew, Prince William, Prince Charles, Kate Duchess of Cambridge, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry arrive to attend a Christmas Service at St Mary’s church on the grounds of Sandringham Estate, the Queen’s Norfolk retreat, England, Dec. 25, 2011.

The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain. Last year, a court case revealed Andrew’s relationship with a businessman and  suspected Chinese spy  who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the  man could have misused his influence  over Andrew, according to court documents.

The visit is very important to Charles, who has made the bridging of faiths an important part of his “mantra,” said George Gross, an expert on theology and the monarchy at King’s College, London. “I think this was the speediest, really the quickest way of lowering his status even more without having to go to Parliament,” Gross said. “Even if Parliament would have approved, it takes time.’’ Charles may also have been motivated by a desire to protect the work of Queen Camilla, who has made combating domestic violence one of her signature issues, and the Duchess of Edinburgh, who has sought to combat sexual violence in war zones such as Congo. The king will hope that this move finally draws a line between Andrew and the rest of the royal family, Prescott said. “If there are allegations, or further stuff comes out, it will all be on Prince Andrew,” he said. “They’ve severed the connection between Prince Andrew and the monarchy as an institution.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-crackdown-american-economy-e00e12257737680ba55c35c3bc25768f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:04:55+00:00","title":"Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Weighs Heavy on U.S. Labor Market and Economy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the economic and human consequences of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, focusing on the termination of the humanitarian parole program and the increased H-1B visa fees.

Businesses such as Goodwin Living are struggling to replace foreign workers, and international partners like South Korea are expressing concern over U.S. policy. Economists warn that the loss of immigrant labor could result in near-zero or negative job growth, reduced innovation, and economic stagnation.

$13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries. In August, it all ended. When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.   “I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’ President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money.

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.  In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth  “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.’’ Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The  September jobs report has been delayed  by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump’s immigration and trade policies,  downgraded its forecast  for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ‘We need these people’ Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin. “That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’ Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.” Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The ICE crackdown Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion’’ at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible. The law pours  $150 billion into immigration enforcement , setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.  And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have. The incident enraged the South Koreans and  ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers  to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained. Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters. But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has  stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum. “You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’ Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born  Medicaid recipients could head to the fields  to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’ The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.  “The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’ “You’re not welcome here’’ Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May. “Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’ Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000. “A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’  Some are already packing up. In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders. The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said. _____ Wiseman reported from Washington and Salomon from Miami.

The military rescued the pair after striking a submersible vessel Thursday, in what was at least the sixth such attack since early September.  “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump said in a social media post. “U.S. Intelligence confirmed this vessel was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics.” After Trump’s announcement, the Pentagon posted on X a brief black-and-white video of the strike. In the clip, a vessel can be seen moving through the waves, its front portion submerged inches below the water’s surface. Then, several explosions are seen, with at least one over the back of the vessel. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Republican president said two people onboard were killed — one more than was previously reported — and the two who survived are being sent to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 China’s ruling Communist Party meets to map out plans for the next 5 years \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 US warns Hamas planning attack on Palestinian civilians in apparent violation of Gaza ceasefire \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Photos show ‘No Kings’ rallies against Trump across the US and in Europe \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed Saturday on X that the Colombian man who was detained aboard what he called a “narco submarine” was home. “We are glad he is alive, and he will be prosecuted according to the law,” Petro wrote in a brief post. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The press office for Ecuador’s government said Saturday it was not immediately aware of plans for repatriation. With Trump’s statement on his Truth Social platform of the death toll, that means U.S. military action against vessels in the region have killed at least 29 people.  The president has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is  engaged in an “armed conflict”  with drug cartels. He is relying on the same legal authority used by the George W. Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks, and that includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership. Trump is also treating the suspected traffickers as if they were enemy soldiers in a traditional war. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The repatriation avoids questions for the Trump administration about what the legal status of the two would have been in the U.S. justice system. It may also sidestep some of the legal issues that arose out of the detention of enemy combatants in the global war on terrorism as well as challenges to the constitutionality of the current operation. To some legal scholars, Trump’s use of such military force against suspect drug cartels, along with his authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law. On Friday, Trump seemed to confirm reports that Maduro has offered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to try to stave off mounting pressure from the United States. Venezuelan government officials have also floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office, according to a former Trump administration official. That plan was also rejected by the White House, The Associated Press reported. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among members of Congress from both parties and complaints about receiving insufficient information on how the attacks are being conducted. But most Republican senators backed the administration last week on a measure that would have required Trump’s team to get approval from Congress before more strikes. Meanwhile, another resolution to be considered would prevent Trump from outright attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization. ___ Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Florida."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/yemen-ship-gulf-of-aden-houthis-25543875a66516c99ec937952542972f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"11:42:10+00:00","title":"Cameroonian-Flagged Ship Fires in Gulf of Aden Off Yemen, Sparking International Debate Over Cause","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Cameroonian-flagged tanker, the Falcon, caught fire in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen, with at least one crew member missing and another possibly still aboard.

Aden off Yemen after possibly being struck by a projectile, officials said, with at least one mariner missing and another still likely aboard the burning tanker after the rest of the crew abandoned the vessel. U.K. and European Union officials offered differing opinions about what sparked the blaze on the Falcon, with the British suggesting a projectile hit it, while the EU said that it appeared to be “an accident.” They warned ships in the area that the vessel could explode, because it was “fully loaded” with liquefied petroleum gas.  The incident comes as Yemen’s  Houthi rebels  have been attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor. However, the rebels didn’t immediately claim to have been involved, though it can take them hours or even days to do so.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, or UKMTO, center issued an alert about the Falcon, describing the incident as taking place around 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Aden.  “A vessel has been hit by an unknown projectile, resulting with a fire,” the UKMTO said. “Authorities are investigating.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Thousands rally in Albanian capital against EU-backed court prosecuting Kosovo war veterans \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Political deadlock and spending on dual crises leaves French finances in disarray \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Europe’s main center-left political group expels Slovak leader’s party for breaching its values \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The EU’s Operation Aspides, which has been patrolling the area, said that the Falcon’s crew of 26 was all Indian except for one Ukrainian.

The Falcon previously had been identified by United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based pressure group, as operating allegedly in an Iranian “ghost fleet” of ships moving their oil products in the high seas despite international sanctions.

The Houthis have gained international prominence during the Israel-Hamas war over their attacks on shipping and Israel, which they said were aimed at forcing Israel to stop fighting. Since the  ceasefire began on Oct. 10 , no attacks have been claimed by the rebel group.  The  Houthi campaign  against shipping has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk. It upended  shipping in the Red Sea , through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The rebels’ most recent attack hit the Dutch-flagged  cargo ship Minervagracht  on Sept. 29, killing one crew member on board and wounding another. Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence they were spies — something fiercely denied by the world body and others."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/leaders-flee-uprisings-coup-protests-1a2dfa6b1220a83875451dfe2b6bb3ae","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Conflict Between Nation A and Nation B Escalates, Ceasefire Reached After International Intervention","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major military conflict between Nation A and Nation B began on April 4, 2024, following a surprise attack on Military Base X.

The most recent international leader to join the list is Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar, who was  overthrown in a military coup  this week. His fall came after weeks of  Gen Z-led demonstrations  over hardship, lack of opportunities and power shortages in the Indian Ocean island nation.

Sri Lankans blamed Rajapaksa, who was part of a powerful family political dynasty, for the disaster. He was forced to resign, along with his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa who was prime minister, and two other brothers and a nephew who served in his Cabinet.

Yanukovych and opposition leaders would strike a deal  aimed at bringing Ukraine’s political crisis to an end but he secretly fled the capital that evening. Ukrainian MPs voted to impeach him and hold early presidential elections while an  arrest warrant was issued  for him following the protests which led to the deaths of dozens of civilians.  Putin and Yanukovych would later state that Russian forces helped Yanukovych fly to Russia via Crimea. Moammar Gadhafi  Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi  lost his four-decade grip on power during the 2011 Libyan Civil War, which was part of the wider Arab Spring uprisings.  Rebel forces overthrew Gadhafi after capturing the capital city of Tripoli, forcing him to flee with a handful of loyalists. He hid for weeks amid a  bloody siege by rebel forces in his hometown of Sirte , one of the last strongholds of loyalist resistance.  Gadhafi tried to flee the besieged city on Oct. 20, 2011, with a convoy of loyalist fighters, but they were dispersed after being struck by a NATO air attack. Opposition forces then located Gadhafi in a big drainage pipe and captured him.  Following his death, his body was on public display for a few days before being buried in a secluded desert site.

Ravalomanana was later convicted in absentia of conspiracy to commit murder in a case related to the violence during his overthrow. He was sentenced to life in prison after a trial described as “unfair” by Amnesty International.  After more than five years of exile, he returned to Madagascar and  was arrested  at his home. The following year, his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest.

(AP) — As Democrats dig in for a lengthening  government shutdown , former Vice President Kamala Harris is cheering them on as she travels the country touting her presidential campaign memoir amid speculation about another White House run. The Democratic 2024 nominee told The Associated Press in an interview Friday that she remains in contact with Democrats on Capitol Hill, encouraging them to maintain their demands that President Donald Trump and the Republican congressional majority address  looming spikes  in Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums. “The Republicans control the House. They control the Senate. They control the White House. They are in charge, and they are responsible for the shutdown,” she said. Democrats, she said, “are doing the right thing by standing up for working people and not allowing the Republicans to carry a tax cut for the wealthiest people in our country on the backs of working people in America.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n It was just one example of Harris using her  book tour  to urge Democrats to lead a consistent, aggressive resistance to Trump while at the same time recommitting to reaching working- and middle-class voters who supported the Republican or stayed home last November. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump’s immigration crackdown weighs heavy on the US labor market \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 President Donald Trump drops the F-bomb before the cameras.

Paid ticketholders filled downtown Birmingham’s Alabama Theatre, where Harris discussed her campaign, the Democratic Party and the course of the nation with radio host Charlamagne tha God.  \n    \n     Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government.  What questions do you have for them? \n    \n \n Through it all, Harris projected the aura of party elder and future candidate. She expressed concern for the country’s direction and outright incredulity over many of Trump’s actions. When VIP ticketholders told her in a photo line how disappointed they had been by her loss, she played it forward. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “We’ve got work to do,” she said repeatedly. “Keep fighting.” On stage and to the AP, she praised her party’s “deep and wide bench” and even called for lowering the nation’s voting age to 16 to bring more young people into the political process. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Harris signals she’s not done Harris, 60, maintained she has made no decision about her own political future. But she made clear that running again in 2028 is still on the table and that she sees herself as a player in the party and a voice in the national discourse. “I am a leader of the party,” she told the AP. “I take seriously that responsibility and duty that I feel” as the previous nominee. That “includes traveling the country talking and mostly listening with folks,” she said, and “getting folks ready to fight in the midterms” in 2026. Harris aides confirmed she will help Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia with virtual events, fundraising appeals and robocalls. She also recently headlined a fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Roy Cooper, a former governor and Harris’ longtime friend. Later this month, she plans to campaign for California’s “Yes on Prop 50,” the ballot measure that would allow a Democratic-led redraw of the state’s congressional districts to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other Republican-controlled states. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Authenticity will be key for Democratic candidates Harris, who was unusually blunt in her book “107 Days” about her opinions on a range of political figures, was more circumspect Friday when asked to assess other leading Democrats. “We have to get away from this idea of ‘Who is the one?’ There are many ways that I think will be effective when people are authentic unto themselves,” she said when asked about her fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, and his recent social media mockery of Trump. She named U.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Brittany Petterson, D-Colo., but did not elaborate. “Every voice and every perspective” can resonate with certain voters, she said. Harris rejected conventional political wisdom that she lost in part because of Republicans’ sustained attacks on cultural and social issues, especially transgender issues. She said economics, notably inflation, was the bigger factor. “There are a fair number of people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed what he said, which is that he was going to bring down prices,” she told the AP. “Sadly, he lied to them.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Economic arguments matter most With prices still high and wealth gaps growing, Harris said, “We’ve got to do a better job of dealing with the immediate needs of the American people.” She praised the Biden administration’s legislative accomplishments but said household-level policies such as child tax credits, family leave and first-time homebuyer credits should have come before a sweeping infrastructure program and the CHIPS semiconductor manufacturing law. Even with a sharper economic message, Harris acknowledged structural challenges for Democrats: the proliferation of  false information  and what she described as conservatives’  assault on democracy. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n She rejected the idea of “low-information voters,” saying the problem is actually an abundance of misinformation and disinformation that makes it harder to reach many voters. She said Democrats must penetrate those silos rather than presume anyone is a lost cause. “They deserve to be heard,” she said. Backsliding on civil rights Onstage, Harris described a “reversal” of the Civil Rights Movement. She lamented that the Supreme Court could eliminate Section 2 of the  Voting Rights Act , which protects political district boundaries drawn to ensure minority communities can elect candidates of their choice. Without that law, nonwhite representation –- especially  Black representation  in the South –- could diminish considerably, from Congress to local school boards and municipal councils.  “How can we say at this moment in time that the Voting Rights Act and Section 2 has no purpose?” Harris said to the AP. The issue carried special resonance given the venue.  The Voting Rights Act passed in 1965  after Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights leaders marched from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. A later Supreme Court case out of Mobile led Congress to clarify its intent with Section 2 of the law. And it was a Shelby County, Alabama, case that the Supreme Court used in 2013 to  gut the law’s requirement  that the U.S. Justice Department approve election procedures in local jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of discrimination. Besides the pending Supreme Court case, Harris said she has followed Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants, along with statements from top Trump adviser Stephen Miller and other Republicans suggesting the U.S. owes its identity to white European settlers. “Just looking at it in terms of their words, they’re race baiting, they’re scapegoating,” she said. But she stopped short of saying the administration is being driven by a white nationalist ideology: “I can’t pretend to know what is in their head.” Harris said Friday that she never doubted former President Joe Biden’s ability to serve, even when he  ended his reelection bid  because of concerns about his age. That’s different, she explained, than discussions about whether the 82-year-old could have served another term. “He and I have been playing phone tag actually in the last couple of days,” Harris told the AP when asked whether she still talks to Biden, who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment. “I’d invite everyone to say a prayer if that’s what you do for his well-being and health right now.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-pakistan-cricket-border-fighting-232bb8c59918af77a92b6d16e4adb52b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:58:09+00:00","title":"Afghanistan and Pakistan Agree to Ceasefire After Deadly Cross-Border Violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after over a week of violent cross-border fighting that killed dozens and injured hundreds, marking the deadliest crisis between the two nations in several years.

Afghanistan denies harboring militants who carry out attacks in border areas.  Pakistan is grappling with militancy that has surged since 2021, when the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan and returned to power. The fighting threatened to further destabilize a region where groups including the  Islamic State group  and  al-Qaida  are trying to resurface. Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst, said the ceasefire gave the two sides “more breathing room” to think about what to do next. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 China’s ruling Communist Party meets to map out plans for the next 5 years \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Morocco’s Gen Z protesters demand accountability and education reform \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 US warns Hamas planning attack on Palestinian civilians in apparent violation of Gaza ceasefire \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n But the problem was that the core driver of the crisis remained, Kugelman warned. “The Taliban are not addressing Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism,” he said. “And they’re denying they’re even a part of the problem.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Aerial strikes trigger condemnation, boycott A 48-hour ceasefire intended  to pause hostilities expired Friday evening. Hours later, Pakistan struck across the border. Pakistani security officials confirmed to The Associated Press that there were attacks on two districts in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.  The targets were hideouts of the militant Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. One said the operation was a direct response to the suicide bombing of a  security forces compound in Mir Ali , in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province a day earlier. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Pakistani Air Force raids killed dozens of armed fighters and there were no civilian deaths, they said.

They sat in the open air as loudspeakers broadcast sermons and condemnation. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, had earlier criticized the “repeated crimes of Pakistani forces and the violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty.”  Such acts were deemed provocative and viewed as “deliberate attempts” to prolong the conflict, he added. The two countries share a 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) border known as the  Durand Line , but Afghanistan has never recognized it.  Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, urged Afghans to choose “mutual security over perpetual violence and progress over hardline obscurantism.” “The Taliban must rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” he told an audience at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as high-level delegations from both countries arrived in the Qatari capital on Saturday for the negotiations. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Locals inspect the site of a cross-border attack by the Pakistani army in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

Sign up here . \n    \n \n BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — The  Bill Belichick era  at North Carolina already had endured several lopsided losses. Now the Tar Heels have a heartbreaking one to go with it. The one thing that North Carolina is still searching for is its first victory over a power opponent since the six-time Super Bowl champion coach took over the program. After losing its first three games against power conference teams by an average of 29 points, the Tar Heels hung tough against California on Friday night until Nathan Leacock’s fumble at the goal line turned a possible go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter into the defining moment of a  21-18 loss . “We’ve been improving every week,” Belichick said. “I’m not going to back off. I think that’s true. But you can’t turn the ball over and win. It’s just too hard. We’ve got to eliminate some of those kind of mistakes.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The most costly one came late when it seemed like the Tar Heels were poised for a comeback win. Gio Lopez hit Leacock on a short pass and Leacock was running toward the end zone when Brent Austin knocked the ball out just before he crossed the goal line. Austin then dove on the loose ball in the end zone to give the Golden Bears the ball back with 3:48 to play. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Byrum Brown, No. 19 South Florida run over Florida Atlantic, 48-13 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Shipley kicks 45-yard FG in OT to lift No. 21 Texas to 16-13 win at Kentucky \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Mark Gronowski leads Iowa rally past Penn State, 25-24 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n Cal ran all but five seconds off on the ensuing drive and the Tar Heels went down to another loss. \n    \n     Think you know who belongs in the  Top 25 ?

Team general manager Michael Lombardi, a former NFL executive who’s largely a partner with Belichick in this college endeavor, is making $1.5 million for each of the next two seasons. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The talk about building  the “33rd” NFL team  with an NFL-style approach in college hasn’t generated positive results, with the team’s only wins coming against lower-level Richmond and Charlotte.

There was also a planned documentary that was canceled, the suspension of an assistant coach and a report that Belichick had been seeking an exit strategy from coaching North Carolina that he had to address in a statement last week and a news conference earlier this week.

2025-10-18T04:10:21+00:00\n\nIt was over four centuries ago to the day Saturday that Filipinos set foot on the North American continent for the first time. Now, Filipino Americans are working to sustain a cultural footprint. During celebration of October’s  Filipino American History Month , many Filipinos are seeking their cities’ acknowledgment of “Filipino Towns” — a cultural district designation similar to Chinatowns, Japantowns and Koreatowns that highlights the contributions of expat and immigrant populations to a major city’s overall identity. That recognition can be through landmarks, event support or even permanent signage. Three years ago, Los Angeles’ Historic Filipinotown — first designated as a neighborhood in 2002 — constructed a gateway arch, and Little Manila in New York City’s Queens borough debuted an official street sign. Now, Las Vegas has joined the club. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An official “Filipino Town Cultural District” street sign was unveiled last week to great fanfare — six months after Clark County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution affirming the distinction. “That was a great day,” Rozita Lee, the original Filipino Town Las Vegas board president, recalled about the county’s approval. “A great day because we realized that the government actually recognized us Filipinos as a valid, solid entity here in Nevada. We were all so happy.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Making the case for Filipino Towns Lee, 90, has lived in Las Vegas for nearly 50 years. She has seen a 1.2-mile (1.6-kilometer) corridor east of the Strip blossom with Filipino small businesses, a radio station and chains like Seafood City supermarket and Jollibee. Last year, the Filipino Town board’s first step was to gather data to bolster their proposal. Filipinos are the largest Asian group in metro Las Vegas with over 200,000. They also spread the word among business owners. “We visited the people that were in the area because we had to knock on doors and let them know of the possibility of this area being named Filipino Town, and would they support,” Lee said. “Everybody said yes.” Now resigned from the board, Lee is currently planning a Filipino American Museum. Current board president Bernie Benito is looking forward to making Filipino Town a site that tourists will consider. “What we’re going to try to do is just to promote it culturally. We’re going to entice developers, investors to come into the area in order to set up their businesses,” Benito said. Filipino Towns were few compared to other ethnic ‘towns’ Filipino scouts on a Spanish galleon — a heavy, square-rigged sailing ship — landed on Oct. 18, 1587, in Morro Bay, California, likely making them the first known Asian people to reach the U.S. It would be nearly 200 years until Filipinos settled here starting in Louisiana and the West Coast. Pre-World War II, there were some Filipino enclaves made up mostly of single men. They were not as prevalent as Chinatowns and Japantowns. A lot of them either were demolished or floundered as some men moved away, said Joseph Bernardo, an adjunct professor in Asian Pacific American Studies at Loyola Marymount University. U.S. colonial rule over  the Philippines  from 1898 to 1946 led to Filipinos studying English and assimilating to Western culture. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “They have a command of English that doesn’t necessarily tie them to an ethnic economy to survive in the United States,” Bernardo said. “They can get jobs as nurses and accountants and lawyers and doctors, et cetera, with greater ease than other Asian immigrants.” The U.S. Census estimates 4.5 million Filipino people live in the U.S. and less than half are immigrants. Registered nurse is the most common occupation, according to AAPI Data, a research and policy organization. “More Filipino Americans care about cultural pride and want a community space to reflect that,” said Bernardo. Today, there are several Filipino Towns, some more active than others. Stockton, California’s once vibrant Little Manila was torn down by a crosstown freeway in the 1970s. But there are historic walking tours hosted by advocacy group Little Manila Rising. In San Francisco, an artist-driven Filipino Cultural Heritage District known as SOMA Pilipinas includes a community center and public art works. Toronto, Canada, also has an active Little Manila. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Why cultural markers and landmarks matter Over two dozen residents excitedly posed for pictures in May in front of a brand new Seattle Streetcar outfitted in a “Filipinotown”-branded wrap. For them, it was a concrete symbol of their Filipinotown, which the Seattle City Council formally recognized in 2017. Devin Cabanilla, executive director of Filipinotown Seattle, applied to get the special streetcar. “I think having that streetcar has really jump-started us because I mean to some extent the general public doesn’t care. So what if you have some law that says you’re Filipinotown? What are the visible markers of it?” Cabanilla said. “People do want something tangible.” Cabanilla’s great aunt and uncle, Dorothy and Fred Cordova, are credited with creating Filipino American History Month in 1992 through their organization, the Filipino American National Historical Society. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Filipinotown is part of Seattle’s Chinatown-International District. Besides restaurants and shops, Cabanilla hopes visitors stop to appreciate landmarks like the Dr. Jose Rizal Bridge, named after the writer who advocated for Filipino independence. Or Uncle Bob’s Place, an affordable apartment building named for local Filipino American civil rights activist Bob Santos. Future goals for Filipinotown include an official sign, events like poetry sessions and a summer block party. “Our primary vision is to bring back the solidarity that we had when the International District was in its heyday and it was a multicultural place,” Cabanilla said. “I need white people to understand it is not just Chinese, Japanese, East Asian stuff. It has always included Filipinos supporting and living in the district.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-18-2025-4d13aaceec91c360449dd5fa737b192b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:38:10+00:00","title":"Hamas Hands Over Hostage Remains in Ceasefire Effort Amid Escalating Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a developing ceasefire scenario following two years of war between Israel and Hamas, Hamas has handed over the remains of 12 of 28 deceased hostages taken during the October 7, 2023, attack.

deceased hostages  ” from  Gaza  late Saturday, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu increased pressure on the militant group to share the rest more quickly under their ceasefire. No names were immediately released. The bodies were in Israel and were being taken to the country’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine. Israel announced earlier Saturday that Gaza’s sole crossing with the outside world,  Rafah , would stay closed “until further notice,” tying it to Hamas’ release of remains. On Thursday it had said the crossing likely would reopen Sunday. Hamas has now handed over the remains of 12 of the 28 dead hostages in Gaza, a key step in the week-old ceasefire process meant to end two years of war. The militant group says devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The statement by  Netanyahu  ’s office on the Rafah crossing came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt said it would reopen Monday for people returning to Gaza.

The 76-year-old was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7 attack. His remains were found after bulldozers plowed areas in the southern city of Khan Younis. U.S. President Donald Trump  has warned that he would greenlight a resumption of the war by Israel if Hamas doesn’t return the remains of all dead hostages. Hamas has said it is committed to the ceasefire deal, but that the retrieval of remains is also hampered by the presence of unexploded ordnance in the territory’s vast ruins. The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it had  credible reports of an imminent planned attack by Hamas  against residents of Gaza. “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” it said in a statement. ”The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms. “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire” forged by Trump to end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, it added. There were no additional details. The Israeli organization supporting families of those abducted said it will continue holding weekly rallies in Tel Aviv until all are returned. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We don’t want to go back to fighting, God forbid, but this whole ordeal must end, and all the hostages must be returned,” said Ifat Calderon, aunt of freed hostage Ofer Calderon. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     People listen to speeches as they take part in a rally demanding the returning of the bodies of hostages kidnapped by Hamas who are still in Gaza Strip, at a plaza known as hostages square, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

U.N. data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Under the agreement, about 600 aid trucks per day should be allowed to enter. COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said. Israel has said it let in enough food and accused Hamas of stealing much of it, which the U.N. and other aid agencies deny. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Palestinian doctors examine the bodies of Palestinians held by Israel during the war, as part of the identification process at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

There was no immediate response from Israel, which still maintains control of about half of Gaza. On Friday, Gaza’s Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, said nine people were killed, including women and children, when their vehicle was hit by Israeli fire in Gaza City. The Civil Defense said the car crossed into an Israeli-controlled area in eastern Gaza. Israel’s army said it saw a “suspicious vehicle” crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching troops. It said it fired warning shots, but the vehicle continued to approach in a manner that posed an “imminent threat.” The army said it acted in accordance with the ceasefire. ___ Mednick reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

The Golden Gophers (5-2, 3-1 Big Ten) have won six straight against the Cornhuskers (5-2, 2-2), who fell short in their bid to win back-to-back road games in consecutive weeks for the first time since 2006. Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck improved to 7-1 against Nebraska, which hasn’t won in Minneapolis since 2015. “Nine sacks; I love that,” said Fleck, whose team was without two of its top three cornerbacks due to injury. “We’re really proud of a program record. ... We’re talking about the whole complete defense doing what you’re supposed to do when you’re supposed to do it.” Raiola completed 17 of 25 passes for 177 yards for the Huskers, who spent part of a short week  addressing rumors  of coach Matt Rhule’s candidacy for the vacant Penn State job. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Anthony Smith and Karter Menz each had 2 1/2 sacks for Minnesota.

Lindsey found Le’Meke Brockington in the front corner of the end zone on a 20-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-6 with 2:36 left in the third quarter. A fourth-down defensive holding call kept the 98-yard, 14-play drive intact. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “That’s Gopher football right there,” Fleck said. “Nothing makes me more proud than that drive.” A pass-interference penalty negated a Nebraska interception on Minnesota’s next possession, capped by Taylor’s 1-yard touchdown run. Minnesota led 7-6 at halftime thanks to a 1-yard, tush-push score by Lindsey 1:40 into the second quarter. Taylor’s 71-yard run down the right sideline set up the touchdown and eclipsed the running back’s 44 yards in the previous two games, his first since missing two contests with an injury. “It was perfectly blocked,” said Taylor, who reached 2,000 yards in just 23 games career games, tied for the third fewest for a Gopher since 1955 behind only Darrell Thompson (18 games) and Laurence Maroney (21). “The running back room has a long history here, and we do our best to uphold that every week.” O-line attrition Nebraska spent much of the evening without two starting linemen. Guard Rocco Spindler was taken to the hospital with a broken finger, Rhule said, and tackle Elijah Pritchett was ejected for targeting in the second quarter. “Obviously, you lose two offensive linemen, that’s going to hurt you,” Rhule said. “But we’re not going to make any excuses. (Minnesota) got after us.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The takeaway Nebraska: Combined with the injuries, inconsistent line play on both sides of the ball caught up with the Huskers, who were outgained 186-36 on the ground and rarely created a clean pocket for Raiola. Minnesota: Ranked 114th nationally with 112.3 yards per game before Friday, the Gophers’ rushing attack finally found its legs with the same outside zone runs that have vexed Nebraska in this matchup for the better part of the last decade.

(AP) —  Brent Austin forced a fumble  at the goal line and recovered it in the end zone to preserve the lead in the fourth quarter, giving California a 21-18 victory over Bill Belichick and North Carolina on Friday night. “Just came up a little bit short today, a couple inches I guess on the touchdown on the fumble,” Belichick said. Belichick looked poised for his first win in four games against a power conference opponent since taking over the Tar Heels (2-4, 0-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) when North Carolina was driving for the go-ahead score. Gio Lopez hit Nathan Leacock on a short pass and Leacock was running toward the end zone when Austin knocked the ball out just before he crossed the goal line.

But the  results have been underwhelming  as the Tar Heels have lost all four games against power conference opponents, \n    \n     Think you know who belongs in the  Top 25 ? Now it’s your turn to vote with the  AP Top 25 fan poll. \n    \n \n After getting outscored by 87 points in the first three losses, the Tar Heels were far more competitive against Cal even if the end result was the same. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “We’ve been improving every week,” Belichick said. “I’m not going to back off. I think that’s true. But you can’t turn the ball over and win. It’s just too hard. We’ve got to eliminate some of those kind of mistakes.” The game started like the season has gone for North Carolina with Shanard Clower losing a fumble on the first play from scrimmage and Cal turning it into a touchdown when Sagapolutele scored four plays later. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But the Tar Heels tied it on Benjamin Hall’s 18-yard run and trailed only 14-10 at the half for their closest first half in four games against power teams this season.  Cal took the second-half kickoff and drive down for a touchdown to take a 21-10 lead on Kendrick Raphael’s 2-yard run but couldn’t pull away as North Carolina cut it to 21-18 on Davion Gause’s TD run early in the fourth quarter. The takeaway North Carolina: The Tar Heels came into the game ranked in the bottom three among power conference teams in scoring and yards per play and didn’t do much to change that. They had no first downs on their first three drives and averaged 4.7 yards per play for the game.  California: The Bears bounced back from a lopsided home loss against Duke but weren’t sharp at all on offense. Sagapolutele completed just 21 of 39 passes and the team struggled to move the ball consistently.  Up next North Carolina: Hosts No. 18 Virginia on Oct. 25. California: At Virginia Tech on Friday night. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up  here  and  here  (AP News mobile app).

having “practically disappeared”.\n\nFacing questions about Mexico’s alert system, Sheinbaum said there were no meteorological signs “that could have indicated to us that the rain was going to be of this magnitude”.\n\nMeteorologists have said the rains occurred thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, which caused rivers to rapidly rise, leading to flooding

a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/11/at-least-28-killed-in-heavy-flooding-caused-by-tropical-storms-in-mexico","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-11","timeOfPublication":"06:38:46+00:00","title":"At least 37 people killed in flooding caused by tropical storms in Mexico","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexico has suffered at least 37 fatalities and widespread damage due to flooding triggered by heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Raymond and remnants of Tropical Storm Priscilla and Post-Tropical Cyclone Octave.

after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor company Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology, under the Goods Availability Act due to serious managerial shortcomings and concerns over the continuity of critical technological capabilities in Europe.

intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/bosnias-republika-srpska-installs-temporary-president-as-dodik-steps-aside","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:32:06Z","title":"Bosnia’s Republika Srpska installs temporary president as Dodik steps aside","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bosnia’s Republika Srpska has appointed Ana Trisic Babic as interim president, marking the first formal recognition that Milorad Dodik is stepping aside after being barred from politics by a state court.

States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:21:25+00:00","title":"Iran says restrictions on nuclear programme ‘terminated’ as deal expires","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran has declared that the nuclear restrictions imposed under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have officially terminated, marking the end of a 10-year agreement.

The group called on United States President Donald Trump and mediators to pressure Israel to respect the ceasefire agreement.\n\nIn that attack, Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who crossed the so-called “yellow line”, the demarcation to which Israel’s military was supposed to pull back under the ceasefire terms.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza, said many Palestinians lack internet access and are unaware of where Israeli forces remain positioned along the so-called demarcation lines, putting families at risk.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has claimed that the yellow lines in Gaza will soon be marked out for clarity.\n\nIsraeli forces remain in control of approximately 53 percent of Gaza, Khoudary said.\n\nAs the exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners under the provisions of the deal has continued, Israel has killed at least 38 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Media Office on Saturday, and heavily restricted the flow of desperately needed aid, including food and medical supplies.\n\nLast week, Israeli forces  killed  five Palestinians in the Shujayea neighbourhood, also in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael has continued to seal the Rafah crossing with Egypt and blocked other key border crossings, preventing large-scale aid deliveries into the famine-stricken enclave.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday that the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, shortly after the Palestinian Embassy in Egypt announced that it would reopen on Monday.\n\n“The crossing’s opening will be considered based on the manner in which Hamas fullfills its part in returning the deceased hostages and implementing the agreed-upon framework,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe United Nations warned this week that aid convoys are struggling to reach famine-hit areas, with 49 percent of people accessing less than six litres of drinking water per day – well below emergency standards.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it has brought an average of 560 tonnes of food daily into Gaza since the ceasefire began, far below what is needed to address widespread malnutrition and prevent famine.\n\nHamas has said it remains committed to the ceasefire terms, including returning the remains of Israeli captives still under Gaza’s rubble.\n\nThe Israeli military said late on Saturday that the Red Cross has received two coffins of dead Israeli captives and they were handed over to Israeli forces for identification.\n\nHamas  handed over the body  of another captive on Friday evening, bringing the total to 10 since the truce began. Hamas has increased efforts to recover all the bodies of the captives despite little excavating machinery to fulfil the terms of the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has not allowed those machines into the enclave – where the bodies of thousands of Palestinians are believed to remain trapped under the debris – and has not yet permitted the entry of international experts to help retrieve the captives’ remains.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said by blocking heavy equipment and machinery from entering, Israel is creating “a challenge for the residents of Gaza who are experienced and have the expertise to search and to dig out bodies from under the rubble” with that type of equipment.\n\nIsrael has also returned the bodies of 15 Palestinians whose identities remain unknown, bringing the total number of bodies received by Palestinian authorities under the terms of the ceasefire deal to 135.\n\nSome of the returned bodies  exhibit signs of torture , including hanging and rope marks, bound hands and feet, and gunfire at close range, according to health officials in Gaza."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/palestinian-detainee-relays-how-torture-in-israeli-prison-made-him-blind","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:06:56+00:00","title":"Palestinian detainee relays how torture in Israeli prison made him blind","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mahmoud Abu Foul, a 28-year-old Palestinian from northern Gaza, lost his vision after enduring severe torture at Sde Teiman prison, where guards beat him and denied him medical treatment.

months in Israeli detention, but could not see her face.\n\nA 28-year-old from northern Gaza, Abu Foul was arrested from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya in late December and imprisoned in Israeli detention facilities, where he says guards tortured and beat him so severely that he lost his sight.\n\nHe was released this week as part of a United States-brokered ceasefire deal that has seen nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees let out from Israeli jails, many bearing  visible signs of abuse.\n\nAbu Foul, who had already lost his leg in a 2015 Israeli bombing, told Al Jazeera he endured relentless torture during his imprisonment. At Sde Teiman prison, a facility other detainees describe as “the prison that breaks men”, Abu Foul endured repeated beatings and torture.\n\nOne day, guards struck him on the head with such force that he fell unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he discovered he had lost his sight, he said.\n\n“I kept asking for medical treatment, but they only gave me one type of eye drops, which did nothing,” he said. “My eyes kept tearing constantly, with discharge and pain, but no one cared.”\n\nHe tried a hunger strike to demand treatment but said prison authorities did not respond to his demands.\n\nWhen Abu Foul was finally released and transferred to Nasser Hospital, he waited anxiously for his family. He had heard northern Gaza was devastated and feared the worst. Then his mother arrived.\n\n“When I heard her voice, I hugged her tightly,” he said. “I couldn’t see her, but just hearing her was worth the whole world.”\n\nAbu Foul now lives in a tent near ruins, still without treatment for his eyes, and is seeking help to travel abroad for medical care.\n\nHis account aligns with a growing body of evidence documenting systematic abuse in Israeli prisons. Many of the Palestinians released this week emerged emaciated or with visible injuries. One prisoner had lost  nearly half his body weight  during detention.\n\nThe Palestinian Centre for Human Rights documented testimonies from 100 former detainees held between October 2023 and 2024, finding that torture was systematic across all Israeli prison facilities, not just notorious sites like Sde Teiman.\n\nAll were held incommunicado without access to judges, lawyers or family members.\n\nIsrael has returned at least 100 bodies of Palestinians who died in detention. Medical sources told Al Jazeera they found evidence of abuse on some of the corpses, and some indicated possible executions.\n\n“They did not die naturally, they were executed while restrained,” said Dr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that at least 75 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli prisons since October 2023.\n\nIsraeli rights group B’Tselem described the prison system last year as a “network of torture camps” where detainees face systematic physical abuse, are denied food and medical care, and suffer sexual violence.\n\nDespite hundreds of reported abuse cases since October 2023, Israeli authorities have brought indictments in only two incidents, with no prison service personnel charged, according to the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), an Israeli rights group documenting torture.\n\nDr Ruchama Marton, founder of Physicians for Human Rights – Israel, says her decades-long campaign exposed the use of torture in Israel but has failed to stop it. “Maybe people didn’t deny it any more, but in practice it became normalized,” she told Haaretz.\n\nIsrael’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prison service, has defended the harsh treatment of Palestinian prisoners and said “summer camps and patience for the terrorists are over”.\n\nBen-Gvir has also been filmed taunting high-profile Palestinian political leader and detainee Marwan Barghouti.\n\nEarlier this week, Barghouti’s son said he fears for his father’s life in Israeli prison amid reports from witnesses that he was beaten by guards last month.\n\nIn an  interview with Al Jazeera  on Thursday, Arab Barghouti accused Israel of targeting his father because he is a unifying figure among Palestinians.\n\nThe family told media outlets this week that they had received testimonies from Palestinian detainees released as part of  the Gaza ceasefire deal  that Barghouti was beaten by guards in mid-September as he was being transferred between two Israeli prisons.\n\nAbout 9,000 Palestinian prisoners remain in Israeli jails, many without trial or any proper legal process. Israel has denied allegations of systematic abuse but has not provided evidence to counter the claims.\n\nThe Israeli military and prison service did not respond to requests for comment."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-gather-for-anti-trump-no-kings-protests-across-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"17:03:46+00:00","title":"Crowds gather for anti-Trump ‘No Kings’ protests across US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 2,600 'No Kings' protests are taking place across the United States and internationally, primarily in response to President Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, education, and security.

‘No Kings’ protests across US\n\nProtesters have gathered in several United States cities for “No Kings” demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, education and security, with organisers saying they expect more than 2,600 events across the country.\n\nWith signs such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism,” in many places the rallies on Saturday  looked more like a street party.\n\nThere were marching bands, a huge banner with the US Constitution’s “We The People,” preamble that people could sign, and protesters wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe rallies are the third mass mobilisation since Trump’s return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programmes and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organisers warn are a slide towards US authoritarianism.\n\nDemonstrators packed New York City’s Times Square, Boston Common, Chicago’s Grant Park and hundreds of smaller public spaces\n\nThe rallies had started outside the US, with a couple of hundred protesters gathering outside the US embassy in London, and hundreds more holding demonstrations in Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nMany protesters were walking on overpasses across roads heading into Washington, DC throughout the day.\n\nMany protesters are especially angered by attacks on their motivations for taking to the streets. In Bethesda, Maryland, one held up a sign that said: “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting.”\n\nTrump himself is away from Washington at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\n“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Friday.\n\nMore than 2,600 rallies are planned on Saturday in cities large and small, organised by hundreds of coalition partners.\n\nWhile the earlier protests this year – against Elon Musk’s cuts in spring, then to counter Trump’s military parade in June – drew crowds, organisers say this one is building a more unified opposition movement.\n\nTop Democrats such as Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders are joining in what organisers view as an antidote to Trump’s actions, from the administration’s clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids.\n\n“There is no greater threat to an authoritarian regime than patriotic people-power,” said Ezra Levin, a cofounder of Indivisible, among the key organisers.\n\nBefore noon, several thousand people had gathered in New York City’s Times Square, chanting “Trump must go now”.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said it has given legal training to tens of thousands of people who will act as marshals at the various marches, and those people were also trained in de-escalation.\n\nRepublicans have sought to portray participants in Saturday’s rallies as far outside the mainstream of US politics, and a main reason for the prolonged government shutdown, now in its 18th day.\n\nFrom the White House to Capitol Hill, GOP leaders disparaged the rallygoers as “communists” and “Marxists”.\n\nThey say Democratic leaders, including Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.\n\n“I encourage you to watch – we call it the Hate America rally – that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types”, people who “hate capitalism”, and “Marxists in full display”.\n\nIn a Facebook post, former presidential contender Sanders said, “It’s a love America rally”.\n\nDana Fisher, a professor at American University in Washington, DC, and the author of several books on US activism, forecast that Saturday could see the largest protest turnout in modern US history – she expected that more than 3 million people would participate, based on registrations and participation in the June events.\n\n“The main point of this day of action is to create a sense of collective identity amongst all the people who are feeling like they are being persecuted or are anxious due to the Trump administration and its policies,” Fisher said. “It’s not going to change Trump’s policies. But it might embolden elected officials at all levels who are in opposition to Trump.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-evacuate-philippine-coast-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-approaches","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:05:43+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuate Philippine coast as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches the Philippine coast, thousands of residents from the island of Catanduanes have evacuated due to warnings of coastal flooding and high winds.

SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday.\n\nHe said that US intelligence has confirmed the vessel was carrying fentanyl and other narcotics.\n\nThe vessel was targeted on Thursday in what Trump described as a strike aimed at disrupting a major drug trafficking route.\n\nTwo crew members were killed, he said, while two others  survived  and were airlifted by US forces in a helicopter rescue operation to a nearby US Navy warship.\n\nThe US military held the survivors on board at least until Friday evening.\n\nThe press office for Ecuador’s government said it was not aware of the plans for repatriation. There was no immediate comment from Colombian authorities.\n\nAt least six vessels, most of them speedboats, have been targeted by US strikes in the Caribbean since September, with Venezuela alleged to be the origin of some of them.\n\nWashington says its campaign is dealing a decisive blow to drug trafficking, but it has provided no evidence that the people killed were drug smugglers.\n\nWith Trump’s confirmation of the death toll on his Truth Social platform, that means US military actions against vessels in the region have killed at least 29 people.\n\nThe president has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. He is relying on the same legal authority used by the administration of former President George W Bush when it declared a war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the US. This includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and use lethal force to take out their leadership. Trump is also treating the suspected traffickers as if they were enemy soldiers in a traditional war.\n\nPrevious similar strikes have raised concerns from Democratic lawmakers and legal experts who argue that such operations may exceed accepted wartime authority and risk violating international law.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the latest targeted vessel had been “built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs”.\n\nThe mission comes amid a sharp US  military buildup  across the Caribbean, involving guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear-powered submarine and about 6,500 troops.

voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.\n\nDisappointed, but still very much

under Russian control since early in Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and is not in service, but it needs reliable power to cool its six shutdown reactors and spent fuel to avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents.\n\nIt has been operating on diesel generators since September 23, when its last remaining external power line was  severed in attacks  that each side blamed on the other. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear plant, which is the biggest in Europe.\n\nThe Associated Press news agency reported earlier this week that the IAEA is proposing to restore external power to the plant in two phases, quoting a European diplomat briefed on the proposal by Grossi. A Russian diplomat confirmed some aspects of the plan.\n\nBoth diplomats spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the confidential negotiations publicly.\n\nDuring the first phase, a 1.5km-radius (1-mile-radius) ceasefire zone would be established to allow repair of the Dniprovska 750-kilovolt line, the main power line to the plant that has been damaged in an area under Russian control.\n\nDuring the second phase, a second such ceasefire zone would be established to repair the Ferosplavna-1 330-kilovolt backup line, which is in area under Ukraine’s control.\n\nGrossi held talks with both Kyiv and Moscow last month. He met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on September 29 at the Warsaw Security Forum, following meetings in the Russian capital with President Vladimir Putin on September 25 and Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev on September 26.\n\nThe IAEA warned that if diesel generators fail, “it could lead to a complete blackout and possibly causing an accident with the fuel melting and a potential radiation release into the environment, if power could not be restored in time”.\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister accused Russia on Sunday of deliberately severing the external power line to the station, to link it to Moscow’s power grid.\n\nA top Russian diplomat this month denied that Russia had any intention of restarting the plant."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/zimbabwes-governing-party-moves-to-extend-mnangagwa-presidency-to-2030","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:24:09+00:00","title":"Zimbabwe’s governing party moves to extend Mnangagwa presidency to 2030","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zimbabwe’s ruling party, ZANU-PF, has moved to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term by two years, potentially keeping him in power until 2030, following a resolution at its annual conference in Mutare.

WhatsApp users\n\nA United States judge has granted an injunction barring Israeli spyware maker the NSO Group from targeting WhatsApp users, saying the firm’s software causes “direct harm” but slashed an earlier damages award of $168m to just $4m.\n\nIn a ruling on Friday granting WhatsApp owner Meta an injunction to stop NSO’s spyware from being used in the messaging service, district judge Phyllis Hamilton said the Israeli firm’s “conduct causes irreparable harm”, adding that there was “no dispute that the conduct is ongoing”.\n\nHamilton said NSO’s conduct “serves to defeat” one of the key purposes of the service offered by WhatsApp: privacy.\n\n“Part of what companies such as WhatsApp are ‘selling’ is informational privacy, and any unauthorised access is an interference with that sale,” she said.\n\nIn her ruling, Hamilton said that evidence at trial showed that NSO reverse-engineered WhatsApp code to stealthily install its spyware Pegasus on users’ phones, and repeatedly redesigned it to escape detection and bypass security fixes.\n\nNSO was founded in 2010 and is based in the Israeli seaside tech hub of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv.\n\nPegasus – a  highly invasive software  marketed as a tool for law enforcement to fight crime and terrorism – allows operators to remotely embed spyware in devices.\n\nNSO says it only sells the spyware to vetted and legitimate government law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But Meta, which owns WhatsApp, filed a lawsuit in California federal court in late 2019, accusing NSO of exploiting its encrypted messaging service to target journalists, lawyers and human rights activists with its spyware.\n\nIndependent experts have also said NSO’s software has been  used by nation states , some with  poor human rights records , to target critics.\n\nJudge Hamilton said her broad injunction was appropriate given NSO’s “multiple design-arounds” to infect WhatsApp users – including missed phone calls and “zero-click” attacks – as well as the “covert nature” of the firm’s work more generally.\n\nWill Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said in a statement that the “ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again”.\n\n“We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company,” he said.\n\nMeta had asked Hamilton to extend the injunction to its other products – including Facebook, Instagram and Threads – but the judge ruled there was no way for her to determine if similar harms were being done on the other platforms without more evidence.\n\nHamilton also ruled that an initial award of $168m against NSO for damages to Meta in May this year was excessive, determining that the court did not have “sufficient basis” to support the jury’s initial calculation.\n\n“There have simply not yet been enough cases involving unlawful electronic surveillance in the smartphone era for the court to be able to conclude that defendants’ conduct was ‘particularly egregious’,” Hamilton wrote.\n\nThe judge ruled that the punitive damages ratio should therefore be “capped at 9/1”, reducing the initial sum by about $164m to just $4m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/afghanistan-pakistan-agree-to-immediate-ceasefire-after-talks-in-doha","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"02:35:27+00:00","title":"Afghanistan, Pakistan agree to immediate ceasefire after talks in Doha","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following peace talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey, after a week of deadly cross-border clashes that killed dozens and wounded hundreds.

Pakistan agree to immediate ceasefire after talks in Doha\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after talks mediated by Qatar and Turkiye following a week of  fierce and deadly clashes  along their disputed border.\n\nQatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said early on Sunday that Afghanistan and Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire “and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries”.\n\nDoha said the two countries also agreed to hold follow-up meetings in the coming days “to ensure the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner”.\n\nEarlier, both sides said they were holding peace talks in Doha on Saturday as they sought a way forward, after clashes killed dozens and wounded hundreds in the worst violence between the two South Asian neighbours since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.\n\nStatement | Pakistan and Afghanistan Agree to an

negotiations with the Pakistani side will take place today in Doha,” Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had said, adding that Kabul’s negotiating team, led by Defence Minister Mullah

representatives of Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership.\n\n“The talks will focus on immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism against Pakistan emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border,” the Foreign Office said.\n\nCross-border fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani air strikes along their contested 2,600km (1,600-mile) frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul rein in rebels who had stepped up cross-border attacks in Pakistan, saying the fighters were operating from safe havens in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban has denied giving haven to armed groups to attack Pakistan, and accuses the Pakistani military of spreading misinformation about Afghanistan and sheltering ISIL (ISIS)-linked fighters who have undermined the country’s stability and sovereignty.\n\nIslamabad has denied Kabul’s accusations. Pakistan has accused Kabul of allowing armed groups to reside inside Afghanistan and wage war for years against the Pakistani state in a bid to overthrow the government and replace it with their strict brand of Islamic governance system.\n\nOn Friday, a suicide attack near the border killed seven Pakistani soldiers and wounded 13, security officials said.\n\n“The Afghan regime must rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan and are using Afghan soil to perpetrate heinous attacks inside Pakistan,” Pakistani Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir said on Saturday, addressing a graduation ceremony of cadets."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1333","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"00:33:16+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,333","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, Russia claims to have captured the village of Pleshchiivka in Donetsk, while Ukraine remains silent.

Israel violating ceasefire\n\nHamas has turned over the  remains of two more deceased Israeli captives  from Gaza, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced, as the Palestinian group accused Israel of continuing to commit ceasefire violations and repudiating the commitments made to peace mediators.\n\n“Israel has received, via the Red Cross, the bodies of two hostages”, which were returned to Israeli security forces in Gaza, Netanyahu’s office said in a post on the X social media platform early on Sunday.\n\nThe prime minister’s office said the families of the Israeli captives have been updated on the return of the remains, although no names have been released so far.\n\nThe office said the two bodies have been transferred to the Israeli National Centre of Forensic Medicine, and “upon completion of the identification process, formal notification will be delivered to the families”.\n\n“The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned,” the prime minister’s office added.\n\nWith the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has now returned the remains of 12 of the 28 captives who died in Gaza, a key demand by Israel in the week-old ceasefire deal to end the two-year war.\n\nAccording to the deal, Hamas was to return all of the Israeli captives – both the living and the dead – within 72 hours of its signing. In exchange, Israel was to release 360 bodies of deceased Palestinians and some 2,000 prisoners.\n\nHamas has said the widespread devastation in the Palestinian territory and the Israeli military’s continuing control of certain parts of Gaza have slowed the recovery of the bodies of deceased captives.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinian authorities do not have adequate equipment to help with the search for captives’ bodies beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\n“It’s very difficult, with recovery teams on the ground facing extraordinary challenges. [They have] no bulldozers, no trucks, no cranes and no heavy equipment… to speed up the process and help with the recovery and return of bodies,” Mahmoud said.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, who is reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel and the occupied West Bank, said that Netanyahu’s government has known “for some time” that the  recovery of bodies  of captives would be “an incredibly difficult and daunting task”.\n\nNetanyahu, however, has accused Hamas of not doing enough to return the remains of the 28 and that all of the bodies need to be returned immediately, Salhut said.\n\n“Until that happens, that’s when Israel is going to honour more of the commitments of the ceasefire, like letting in more humanitarian assistance, talking about opening the Rafah border crossing,” she said.\n\nFor days, Hamas and Israel have traded blame over violations of the US-mediated ceasefire.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas accused the Netanyahu government of “fabricating flimsy pretexts” to not follow through on its commitments to the peace deal, as well as denouncing Israel’s refusal to open the Rafah crossing with Egypt as “a blatant violation” of the agreement.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli forces  killed 11 members  of a single family, including seven children, in an attack east of Gaza City.\n\nThe Palestinian Embassy in Egypt announced earlier on Saturday that the  Rafah crossing , the main gateway for people in Gaza to leave and enter the enclave, would reopen on Monday.\n\nBut Netanyahu said the border crossing would remain closed until Hamas hands over the bodies of all the deceased Israeli captives.\n\nThe delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza also remains slow despite the ceasefire deal.\n\nOn Saturday, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it had enough humanitarian food supplies to feed Gaza for three months, but trucks carrying the life-saving cargo are unable to enter Gaza and are stuck in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt.\n\n“We must be allowed to get all this aid into Gaza without delay,” UNRWA said, adding that it also has equipment to provide shelter to as many as 1.3 million people."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/ai-now-sounds-more-like-us-should-we-be-concerned","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"14:46:58Z","title":"AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A surge in AI-generated voice fraud has led to a major scam targeting wealthy Italian businessmen, where fraudsters used deepfake technology to mimic the voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, requesting funds for a fake kidnapping of journalists.

more like us – should we be concerned?\n\nSeveral wealthy Italian businessmen received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1510-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights key developments in science and technology, including Apple’s strategic move amid U.S.-China trade tensions, the global competition over STEM talent through visa policies in the U.S. and China, breakthroughs in AI such as deepfake audio and AI-generated content, the awarding of the Nobel Prize to chemist Omar M.

the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/afghanistan-accuses-pakistan-of-breaking-truce-as-several-killed-in-air-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:29:51+00:00","title":"Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of breaking truce as 10 killed in air attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of breaking a 48-hour ceasefire by launching air attacks on Paktika province, killing at least 10 civilians, including two children, and injuring 12 others.

launched air attacks inside Afghanistan, killing at least 10 people and breaking a  ceasefire  that had brought two days of relative calm to the border after an intensive period of bloodshed, Afghan officials say.\n\nThe 48-hour truce paused nearly a week of  bloody border clashes  that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides.\n\n“Pakistan has broken the ceasefire and bombed three locations in Paktika” province late on Friday, a senior Taliban official told the AFP news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Afghanistan will retaliate.”\n\nTen civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded in the attacks, a provincial hospital official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that two children were among the dead.\n\nIn a statement released after the attacks, an Afghan government spokesperson said officials from both countries will hold crisis talks in Doha on Saturday.\n\n“As promised, negotiations with the Pakistani side will take place today in Doha,” Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.\n\nA high-level Afghan delegation, led by the Minister of Defence Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, has left for Doha, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani state TV reported that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and intelligence chief General Asim Malik will be heading to Doha on Saturday for talks with the Afghan Taliban.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Afghanistan Cricket Board said in a statement that three players who were in the region for a tournament were killed in the latest air strikes alongside five other people “in a cowardly attack carried out by the Pakistani regime” and said seven others were injured.\n\nThe ACB said in a post on social media on Saturday that the cricketers were “targeted during a gathering” in Urgun district when they returned home after playing a friendly cricket match in Sharana, the capital of Paktika province.\n\n“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the ACB said.\n\nIt also said it was withdrawing from the upcoming Tri-Nation T20I Series involving Pakistan, scheduled for next month.\n\nIn Pakistan, a senior security official told AFP that forces had “conducted precision aerial strikes” in Afghan border areas targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, a local faction linked to the  Pakistan Taliban  (TTP).\n\nIslamabad said the same group had been involved in a suicide bombing and gun attack at a military camp in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas district that borders Afghanistan, killing seven Pakistani paramilitary troops.\n\nSecurity issues are at the heart of the tensions, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of harbouring armed groups led by the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, on its soil, a claim Kabul denies.\n\nThe cross-border violence had escalated dramatically since last Saturday, days after explosions rocked the Afghan capital, Kabul, just as the Taliban’s foreign minister began an unprecedented visit to India, Pakistan’s longtime rival.\n\nThe Taliban then launched an offensive along parts of its southern border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to say it would launch a strong response of its own.\n\nWhen the truce began at 13:00 GMT on Wednesday, Islamabad said it was to last 48 hours, but Kabul said the ceasefire would remain in effect until Pakistan violated it.\n\nBefore the latest strikes, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said 37 people were killed and 425 wounded on the Afghan side of the border, calling on both sides to bring a lasting end to hostilities.\n\nIn Spin Boldak, the scene of intense fighting, hundreds of people attended funerals on Thursday, including for children whose bodies were wrapped in white shrouds.\n\n“People have mixed feelings,” Nematullah, 42, told AFP. “They fear that the fighting will resume, but they still leave their homes and go about their business.”\n\nBut earlier on Friday, residents described scenes of normalcy.\n\n“Everything is fine, everything is open,” Nani, 35, told AFP.\n\n“I’m not afraid, but everyone sees things differently. Some say they’re going to send their children elsewhere as the situation isn’t good, but I don’t think anything will happen,” said Nani, who did not give a surname."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/we-dont-want-to-disappear-tuvalu-fights-for-climate-action-and-survival","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"01:07:30+00:00","title":"‘We don’t want to disappear’: Tuvalu fights for climate action and survival","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation barely one meter above sea level, is urgently advocating for immediate and substantial climate finance to prevent its disappearance due to rising sea levels.

fights for climate action and survival\n\nTuvalu’s Minister of Climate Change Maina Talia has told Al Jazeera that his country is fighting to stay above rising sea levels and needs “real commitments” from other countries that will allow Tuvaluans to “stay in Tuvalu” as the climate crisis worsens.\n\nThe low-lying nation of nine atolls and islands, which is situated between Australia and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, is fighting to maintain its sovereignty by exploring new avenues in international diplomacy.\n\nBut, right now, the country needs help just to stay above water.\n\n“Coming from a country that is barely not one metre above the sea, reclaiming land and building sea walls and building our resilience is the number one priority for us,” Talia told Al Jazeera in an interview during the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n“We cannot delay any more. Climate finance is important for our survival,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s not about building [over the] next two or three years to come, but right now, and we need it now, in order for us to respond to the climate crisis,” he said.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister of home affairs and the environment, said the issue of financing will be a key issue at the upcoming UN COP30 climate meeting in Belem, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November.\n\nTuvalu is one of many countries already pushing for a  better deal on climate financing  at this year’s COP, after many advocates left last year’s meeting in Azerbaijan disappointed by the unambitious  $300bn target  set by richer countries.\n\nDescribing the  COP climate meeting  as having become more like a “festival for the oil-producing countries”, Talia said Tuvalu is also exploring a range of alternative initiatives, from a push to create the world’s first fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to seeking to add its entire cultural heritage to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nRepresentatives of oil-producing countries are now attending the COP climate meetings in “big numbers”, Talia said, in order to try and “really bury our voice as small developing countries”.\n\n“They take control of the narrative. They take control of the process. They try to water down all the texts. They try to put a stop to climate finance,” Talia said.\n\n“It’s about time that we should call out to the world that finance is important for us to survive,” he said.\n\n“The polluter pay principle is still there. You pollute, you pay,” he added.\n\nTalia also said that it was frustrating to see his own country struggling to survive, while other countries continue to spend billions of dollars on weapons for current and future wars.\n\n“Whilst your country is facing this existential threat, it’s quite disappointing to see that the world is investing billions and trillions of dollars in wars, in conflicts,” he said.\n\nA report released this week by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) found that 39 small island countries, which are home to some 65 million people, already need about $12bn a year to help them cope with the effects of climate change.\n\nThat figure is many times more than the roughly $2bn a year they are collectively receiving now, and which represents just 0.2 percent of the amount spent on global climate finance worldwide.\n\nGCA, a Rotterdam-based nonprofit organisation, also found that island states are already experiencing an average $1.7bn in annual economic losses due to climate change.\n\nTuvalu is not only focused on its own survival – the island state is considered to be facing one of the most severe existential threats from rising sea levels – it is also continuing to find ways to fight climate change globally.\n\n“That’s why Tuvalu is leading the  Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ,” Talia said.\n\nAbout 16 countries have now signed on to the treaty, with Colombia offering to host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels next year.\n\n“We see its relevance for us,” Talia said of the treaty.\n\n“We want to grow in number in order for us to come up with a treaty, apart from the  Paris Agreement ,” he said.\n\nEven as Tuvalu, a country with a population of less than 10,000 people, is fighting for immediate action on climate change, it is also making preparations for its own uncertain future, including creating a digital repository of its culture so that nothing is lost to the sea.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister for culture, said that he made the formal preliminary submission to UNESCO two weeks before the UNGA meeting for “the whole of Tuvalu to be listed” on the World Heritage List.\n\n“If we are to disappear, which is something that we don’t want to anticipate, but if worst comes to worst, at least you know our values, our culture, heritage, are well secured,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLikewise, Talia said his country doesn’t see its 2023 cooperation pact with Australia, which also includes the world’s first climate change migration visa, as an indication that the island’s future is sealed.\n\n“I don’t look at the Falepili Agreement as a way of escaping the issue of climate change, but rather a pathway,” he said.\n\n“A pathway that we will allow our people in Tuvalu to get good education, trained, and then return home,” he said, referring to the agreement giving some Tuvaluans access to education, healthcare and unlimited travel to Australia.\n\nThe agreement text includes an acknowledgement from both parties that “the statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu will continue, and the rights and duties inherent thereto will be maintained, notwithstanding the impact of climate change-related sea level rise”.\n\nTalia also said that a  recent ruling from the UN’s top court , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, declared that states have a responsibility to address climate change by cooperating to cut emissions, following through on climate agreements, and protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from harm.\n\nThe ICJ ruling “really changed the whole context of climate change debates”, Talia said.\n\n“The highest court has spoken, the highest court has delivered the judgement,” he said of the case, which was brought before the ICJ by Tuvalu’s neighbour Vanuatu.\n\n“So it’s just a matter of, how are we going to live that, or weave that, into our climate policies,” he said.\n\n“We need to hold the industrialised countries accountable to their actions,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has announced stricter export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals—expanding from seven previously restricted metals to include five new ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium)—and restricted access to refining equipment.

metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more.

It's soul food.\n\nThis sweet and spicy dish made with chewy rice cakes is a staple of Korea's street food culture and beloved by people of all ages.\n\nIt's the food students turn to after long school days, and as adults, one you seek after a hard day at work.\n\nSo when readers came across a book titled I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki in 2018, many were immediately intrigued. Its honest yet playful title sparked curiosity, some wondering just how much you must love tteokbokki to write an entire book about it. Many were soon drawn to its raw honesty.\n\nIt became an instant bestseller that was widely discussed and resonated deeply in Korea. This week,  Baek Se-hee, the book's South Korean author, died aged 35 . The details surrounding her death remain unclear. The fact the Korean Organ Donation Agency said Baek had saved five lives by donating her organs, emphasised her wish to help others.\n\nHer death at such a young age has brought deep sorrow to readers who found comfort and understanding in her words. Social media and blogs have been flooded with tributes and personal stories from those her books have helped, while news outlets around the world reported her passing prominently.\n\nAt its heart, the book is a record of Baek's conversations with her psychiatrist as she navigates dysthymia - a mild but long-lasting type of depression - and anxiety disorders. Through these sessions, she opens up about her daily struggles - such as overthinking others' opinions, obsessing over her appearance, and wrestling with self-doubt. Rather than examining clinical depression, she reflects on the gentle melancholy many can relate to.\n\nWhat makes her story so compelling is its candour. She captures that delicate human contradiction of living wearily with everyday sadness alongside the simultaneous desire to keep going. Just like a comforting dish of tteokbokki on a difficult day, her words offer warmth and understanding, reminding readers that even in vulnerability there is strength.\n\nOne of the many young people the book resonated with is Jo Eun Bit, a 25-year-old student at Korea University in Seoul, who found it helped her navigate uncertainty about her future.\n\n\"All generations in Korea tend to measure themselves against what others are doing and the achievements they've made, and that only fuels competition,\" she said. \"But I liked this book because it seems to send the message that it's okay not to live according to the standards set by society.\n\n\"One of the most memorable passages in her book is that I am a one-of-a-kind being in this world, and that alone makes me special. I am someone I should care for throughout my life. The more I look within myself, the happier I believe I will become.\n\n\"To me, this offered comfort that it's okay not to be perfect, and at the same time reminded me that I, too, am someone who needs to be nurtured and cared for.\"\n\nThe relentless competition from school to the workplace, coupled with the pressure to meet family and societal expectations, is leaving many young South Koreans feeling disheartened. In a society still influenced by Confucian values such as righteousness and obedience, mental health issues remain heavily stigmatised and many experience feelings of shame or social judgement.\n\nBaek's book inverted the notion that social success is the ultimate measure of a life well lived, openly addressing the mental health issues many commonly face and, in doing so, showing readers that acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards healing.\n\nSangeun Lee, an elementary school teacher in Korea, told the BBC the book has held a particularly special meaning to her for that reason.\n\n\"With the rise of social media, we're exposed to other people's lives too much, and it makes us increasingly critical of ourselves,\" the 35-year-old said.\n\n\"Being imperfect is natural for everyone, but seeing so much of this kind of information can feel like an attack on yourself, making you wonder if it's even okay to live the way you do. This book encouraged me to accept myself as I am.\"\n\nThe book's popularity has had a real-world impact, supporting many struggling with depression to seek professional help. It has also brought mental health issues into public conversation - RM of BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group known for songs promoting self-love, is among those who have shared the book online.\n\nBaek's pages have resonated far beyond South Korea. First published in 2018, it has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated into 25 languages. In the UK, it sold 100,000 copies within six months of its release.\n\nIt has struck a chord with young women and played a significant role in expanding the reach of Korean literature. Marianna Szucs, a secondary school teacher in London, told the BBC she felt a connection to it and deep sorrow at Baek's death.\n\n\"Her book tells you that if you feel depressed or feel like you have problems, you are not the only one. She had all sorts of problems, from tiny little things to quite daunting ones. I think anyone who reads this book can find something they can relate to.\"\n\nSeunghye Sun, director of the Korean Cultural Centre UK, said \"it is highly symbolic that Baek Se-hee's voice has found resonance in the UK where great psychoanalysts like Freud and his daughter explored the human mind\", in the process broadening the spectrum of K-literature and K-culture.\n\nHer book tells a story that transcends generations and borders, sending a quiet but warm message to countless nameless readers around the world.\n\nIn the end, the paradoxical title \"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki\" may, in fact, be another way of saying, \"I want to live.\" Even in moments of deep despair, people often find the strength to carry on through small joys.\n\nFor her, that joy was tteokbokki, and it shows even the simplest pleasures in daily life can become a sustaining force."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp87ppk7eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:09:53.857+00:00","title":"Bali-fication comes for Lombok, a laidback surfers’ island","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lombok, Indonesia, a laid-back surf and nature destination just east of Bali, is undergoing rapid 'Bali-fication' as the Indonesian government promotes it as a less crowded alternative to Bali.

of Lombok, feels right at home taking tourists out to sea.\n\nWith his fluent English and effortless banter, you would never guess what was his childhood fear: foreigners.\n\n\"When I was 10 or maybe seven, I used to cry - I used to just pee in my pants when I saw white people,\" Damar, now 39, tells the BBC.\n\nThat diffidence waned as the laidback island he calls home slowly found its popularity among Western travellers.\n\nJust east of Bali, Lombok boasts the same azure beaches and stunning views as its famous neighbour, but without the exasperating crowds. Lombok's beaches are still a hidden gem among surfers, as is Mount Rinjani for hikers. Travel sites still liberally use the word \"untouched\" to describe the island as they offer reasons to venture beyond Bali.\n\nSo it should come as little surprise that the Indonesian government has sensed the opportunity to create another lucrative tourist haven on the sprawling archipelago.\n\nThe mission is to create more \"Balis\" - and Lombok will be one of them.\n\nFor islanders, this promise of \"Balification\" is a welcome opportunity but they are also wary of what it brings.\n\nAnd the change has already begun to hit home in more ways than one.\n\nMandalika in the south has been chosen as the heart of the \"new Bali\".\n\nIts rustic coastline has already given way to glitzy resorts, cafes and even a racetrack. Earlier this month, nearly 150,000 spectators showed up to watch the motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, dozens of families were evicted from their village homes for the construction of the Mandalika circuit. Damar's was among them.\n\nConfronted with what activists decried as a messy resettlement plan and unfair compensation, he and his neighbours were helpless, Damar recalls.\n\n\"I was angry, but I cannot do much. I cannot fight against the government,\" he says.\n\nSince the eviction, Damar has bought a plot of land and built his own house, something that many of his neighbours haven't been able to do. As a surf guide, he estimates that he earns twice as much as a fisherman - a generational profession in his community.\n\n\"I've never really been to school, so joining the tourism industry was one of the best choices that I have ever made,\" Damar says. \"Meeting a lot of people from many different countries… It has opened my mind.\"\n\nDamar's indignation about his eviction even comes with a scrupulous caveat: \"I'm not angry at the tourists. I'm just angry at my own government.\"\n\nThe drive to transform Lombok is part of a wider effort to lure travellers away from Bali, which has for decades played an outsized role in Indonesia's tourism industry.\n\nThe island makes up less than 1% of the country's land area and less than 2% of its 280 million-plus population. Yet last year it accounted for nearly half of all visitors to Indonesia.\n\nBut increasingly Bali's unrelenting traffic and pollution - a direct result of its success as a top tourist pick- are leaving those very tourists disappointed with what has long been touted as the \"last paradise\".\n\nAs it turns out, that elusive paradise lies just an hour's boat ride away.\n\nBut perhaps not for long.\n\nMore and more travellers are catching on to Lombok's appeal. Last year, 81,500 foreign tourists touched down at its airport, a 40% jump from the year before - still, a far cry from the 6.3 million foreigners who flocked to Bali.\n\nEager for Lombok to follow in Bali's footsteps, Indonesian authorities have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, along with a $250m loan from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\n\nThis has accelerated the island's makeover.\n\nIn Kuta, a popular town in Mandalika, scrappy surfers' hostels have been replaced by a mosaic of chlorinated pools and plushy sunbeds, and an international school for the children of expats.\n\nWhile authorities are hailing it as Lombok's success story, some see a cautionary tale.\n\nA stone's throw away on the beach of Tanjung Aan, cafe owner Kartini Lumban Raja told the BBC that locals there \"don't want to be 'organised' like Kuta\".\n\n\"When beaches start to look like Kuta, they lose their charm. We lose opportunities. We lose natural beauty,\" she said.\n\nFor months, rumours of evictions had been swirling on Tanjung Aan, which was earmarked for ambitious development plans.\n\nDays after the BBC's visit in July, they came like a rolling wave.\n\nSecurity forces descended upon the beach to demolish nearly 200 stalls, including Kartini's.\n\nVideos from that day show masked men tearing shop fences down with their bare hands as stall owners protested.\n\n\"They were banging on things, kicking plywood… it's truly inhumane,\" Ella Nurlaila, a stall owner, told the BBC. \"My goodness, this eviction was so cruel.\"\n\nThe state-owned company leading Mandalika's tourism drive, InJourney Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), has secured 2.1 trillion rupiah ($128m; £96m) to build a luxury hotel on Tanjung Aan.\n\nAuthorities said the project will create jobs and boost the local economy. But that's little consolation for stall owners like Ella and her husband Adi, who have sold coconuts and coffee on the beach for the past three years.\n\n\"Thousands of people here depend on [coastal land] for their livelihood,\" Adi said. \"Where else are we supposed to go to earn a living?\"\n\nThe couple said they had paid taxes for their stall - which, according to Adi, sat on land belonging to his parents.\n\nBut ITDC representatives told the BBC that Tanjung Aan is \"state-owned land\", and that the tax paid by those businesses \"does not equate to legal ownership or land legitimacy\".\n\nThis is just the latest bout of tensions over Mandalika's tourism push.\n\nJust Finance International, a development finance watchdog, has repeatedly flagged \"a pattern of rights violations linked to the Mandalika project\" in recent years.\n\nUN human rights experts estimate that more than 2,000 people \"lost their primary means of livelihood overnight\" because of the Tanjung Aan evictions. Stall owners were given neither \"adequate notice\" nor \"suitable\" resettlement plans, they said in a statement in August.\n\n\"The people of Mandalika must not be sacrificed for a project that promises economic growth at the expense of human rights,\" they said.\n\nIn its quest for a remarkably different future, Lombok will also have to contend with what this means for local culture.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim island is home to thousands of mosques and the indigenous Sasak ethnic group. Compared to Bali, alcohol is not as readily available in parts of the island. On travel forums, tourists are encouraged to ditch bikinis and hot pants for more modest attire.\n\nSuch conservative sensitivities may change, or at least be driven further inland, as tourism heats up along the coastline. Travellers who have come to love Lombok are not happy about that either.\n\n\"Lombok is so special because it still has its own nature and people come to see that,\" said Swiss tourist Basil Berger, a sceptic of the\"Bali-fication\" of the island.\n\n\"If they want to see Bali, they [should] go to Bali,\" he said. Turning Lombok into another Bali \"is the \"the worst thing that they can do\".\n\nThere are also environmental concerns. The motorcycle Grand Prix last year drew 120,000 spectators to Mandalika, leaving behind 30 tonnes of rubbish that authorities struggled to clear.\n\n\"Before it gets to Bali's stage of development, Lombok could learn. Because it's showing the same kind of strain,\" says Sekar Utami Setiastuti, who lives in Bali.\n\nThe government should ensure \"tourism development brings welfare to a lot of people, instead of just bringing tourists to Lombok\", she adds. \"Lombok has to find its own identity - not just [become] a less crowded Bali.\"\n\nNo matter where that search leads, a new era has dawned on Lombok.\n\nAndrew Irwin is among the foreign investors who have taken an early interest in Lombok's budding tourism. The American is the co-owner of LMBK Surf House, one of Mandalika's most popular surf camps.\n\nThe way he sees it, businesses like his are helping to uplift local employees and their families.\n\n\"It's giving people more opportunities to earn more money, send their kids to proper school, get proper insurance, get proper healthcare, and essentially live a better quality of life,\" he said.\n\nWhile there's \"not necessarily much one can do\" about Lombok's changing landscape, he says, \"we can just hope to bring a positive change to the equation\".\n\nTourism has certainly ushered prosperity into the lives of many locals, who have decided to try their hand at entrepreneurship.\n\n\"As long you want to work, you'll make money from tourism,\" says Baiq Enida Kinang Lare, a homestay owner in Kuta, known to her guests as Lara. Her neighbours too have started homestays.\n\nLara started her business in 2014 with four rooms. She's now at 14, not counting a separate villa under construction.\n\nAs excited as she is about her prospects, she is also a little wistful as she recalled life before the hustle.\n\n\"It's difficult to find time to gather and see everyone. This is what we miss. We feel like the time flies very, very fast because we're busy,\" she says.\n\nThis is a feeling that would surely be shared by locals from Bali to Mykonos to Cancun, whenever tourism took off in their patch of paradise: \"I miss the past, but we like the money.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87400e3j5eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"23:27:19.424+00:00","title":"I saw my Gaza homeland rebuilt before but this time's different","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ayish Younis, an 89-year-old Palestinian man from the village of Barbara, recounts his lifelong journey of displacement, survival, and longing to return to his ancestral home.

time's different'\n\n\"I rode away on a camel with my grandmother, along a sandy road, and I started to cry.\" Ayish Younis is describing the worst moment of his life – he still regards it as such, even though it was 77 years ago, and he's lived through many horrors since.\n\nIt was 1948, the first Arab-Israeli war was raging, and Ayish was 12. He and his whole extended family were fleeing their homes in the village of Barbara - famed for its grapes, wheat, corn and barley - in what had been British-ruled Palestine.\n\n\"We were scared for our lives,\" Ayish says. \"On our own, we had no means to fight the Jews, so we all started to leave.\"\n\nThe camel took Ayish and his grandmother seven miles south from Barbara, to an area held by Egypt that would become known as the Gaza Strip. It was just 25 miles long and a few miles wide, and had just become occupied by Egyptian forces.\n\nIn all an estimated 700,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees as a result of the war of 1948-49; around 200,000 are believed to have crowded into that tiny coastal corridor.\n\n\"We had bits of wood which we propped against the walls of a building to make a shelter,\" Ayish says.\n\nLater, they moved into one of the huge tented camps established by the United Nations.\n\nToday, aged 89, Ayish is again living in a tent in Al-Mawasi near Khan Younis.\n\nIn May last year, seven months into the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, Ayish was forced to leave his home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah after an evacuation order from the Israeli military.\n\nThe four-storey house, divided into several apartments, that he had shared with his children and their families, was destroyed by what he believes may have been Israeli tank-fire.\n\nNow, home is a small white canvas tent just a few metres across.\n\nOther members of the family are in neighbouring tents. They have all had to cook on an open fire. With no access to running water they wash using canned water, which is scarce and as a result expensive.\n\n\"We returned to what we started with, we returned back to tents, and we still don't know how long we will be here,\" he says, sitting in a plastic chair on the bare sand outside his tent, with clothes drying on a washing line nearby.\n\nA walking frame is propped beside him, as he moves with difficulty. But he still speaks in the crystal-clear, melodious Arabic of one who studied literature, and recited the Quran daily as the imam of a local mosque.\n\n\"After we left Barbara and lived in a tent, we eventually succeeded in building a house. But now, the situation is more than a catastrophe. I don't know what the future holds, and whether we will ever be able to rebuild our house again.\"\n\n\"And in the end I just want to go back to Barbara, with my whole extended family, and again taste the fruit that I remember from there.\"\n\nOn 9 October, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The remaining living 20 Hamas-held hostages were returned to Israel and Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners.\n\nYet despite widespread rejoicing over the ceasefire, Ayish is not optimistic about the long-term prospects for Gaza.\n\n\"I hope the peace will spread and it will be calm,\" he says. \"But I believe the Israelis will do whatever they like.\"\n\nUnder the agreement for the first stage of the ceasefire, Israel will retain control of more than half the Gaza Strip, including Rafah.\n\nOne question Ayish, his family and all Gazans are pondering is whether their homeland will ever be successfully rebuilt.\n\nBack in 1948, the Egyptian army had been one of five Arab armies that had invaded the British-controlled territory of Mandate Palestine the day after the establishment of a Jewish state, Israel. But they soon withdrew, defeated, from Barbara, prompting Ayish's decision to flee.\n\nAyish became a teacher when he was 19, and gained a literature degree in Cairo under a scholarship programme.\n\nThe best moment of his life, he says, was when he married his wife Khadija. Together they had 18 children. That, according to a newspaper article that once featured him, is a record – the largest number of children from the same mother and father of any Palestinian family.\n\nToday, he has 79 grandchildren, two of them born in the last few months.\n\nThe family would move from their first tent to a simple three-room cement house with an asbestos roof in the refugee camp, which they later extended to nine rooms – thanks partly to wages earned in Israel.\n\nWhen the border between Israel and Gaza opened, and Ayish's eldest son Ahmed was one of many Palestinians who took advantage of that, working in an Israeli restaurant during his holidays, while studying medicine in Egypt.\n\n\"During that time, in Israel, people were paid very well. And this is the period of time where the Palestinians made most of their money,\" he says.\n\nAll but one of Ayish's children gained university degrees. They became engineers, nurses, teachers. Several moved abroad. Five are in Gulf countries and Ahmed, a specialist in spinal cord injuries, now lives in London. Many other Gazan families are similarly scattered.\n\nThe Younis family, like many Gazans, wanted nothing to do with politics. Ayish became an imam at a Rafah mosque – and a local headman (or mukhtar) responsible for settling disputes, just as his uncle had been years earlier in the village of Barbara.\n\nHe was not appointed by the government – but he says that both Hamas and the Fatah political movement, the dominant party in the Palestinian authority, respected him.\n\nThat didn't save the family from tragedy, though, during the street battles of 2007, when Fatah and Hamas fought for control of the Strip. Ayish's daughter Fadwa was killed in cross-fire as she sat in a car.\n\nThe rest of the family survived through wars between Hamas and Israel in 2008, 2012, 2014 – as well as the devastating war triggered by the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.\n\nThen came that evacuation order by the Israeli military who said they were carrying out operations against Hamas in the area, forcing them to leave their Rafah home and over a year spent living in makeshift tents.\n\nAyish's life has come full circle since 1948. But his greatest desire is to go even further back in time, to return to the village, now in Israel, which he last saw when he was 12 – even though it no longer exists.\n\nApart from clothes, cooking pots and a few other essentials, the only possessions he has with him in his tent are the precious title deeds to his ancestral land in Barbara.\n\nThoughts are now turning to the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nBut Ayish believes the extent of the destruction – of infrastructure, schools and health services – is so great that it cannot be fully repaired, even with the help of the international community.\n\n\"I don't believe Gaza has any future,\" he says.\n\nHe believes that his grandchildren could play a role in the reconstruction of Gaza if the ceasefire is fully implemented, but he does not believe they will be able to find jobs in the territory as good as those they have or could get abroad.\n\nHis son Haritha, a graduate in Arabic language who has four daughters and a son, is also living in a tent. \"An entire generation has been destroyed by this war.\n\n\"We are unable to comprehend it,\" he says.\n\n\"We used to hear from our fathers and grandfathers about the 1948 war and how difficult the displacement was, but there is no comparison between 1948 and what happened in this war.\n\n\"We hope that our children will have a role in rebuilding, but as Palestinians, do we have the capacity on our own to rebuild the schools? Will donor countries play a role in that?\"\n\n\"My daughter has gone through two years of war without schooling, and for two years before that schools were closed because of Covid,\" he continues. \"I used to work in a clothing store, but it was destroyed.\n\n\"We don't know how things will unfold or how we will have a source of income. There are so many questions we have no answers for. We simply don't know what the future holds.\"\n\nAnother of Ayish's sons, Nizar, a trained nurse, who lives in a tent nearby, agrees. He believes Gaza's problems are so great that the youngest generation of the family will not be able to play much role, despite their high level of education.\n\n\"The situation is unbearable,\" he says. \"We hope that life will return to how it was before the war. But the destruction is massive - total destruction of buildings and infrastructure, psychological devastation within the community, and the destruction of universities.\"\n\nAyish's eldest son Ahmed, in London, meanwhile reflects on how it took the family more than 30 years to build their former home into what it eventually became - as money was saved over the years it was expanded, he explains.\n\n\"Do I have another 30 years to work and try to help and support my family? This is really the situation all the time - every 10 to 15 years, people lose everything and they come back to square one.\"\n\nAnd yet he still dreams of living in Rafah again when he retires. \"My brothers in the Gulf bought land in Rafah to come back and settle as well. My son, and my nephews and nieces - they want to go back.\"\n\nWith a pause, he adds: \"By nature, I'm very optimistic, because I know how determined our Gaza people are. Trust me, they will go back and start to rebuild their lives again.\n\n\"The hope is always in the new generation to rebuild.\"\n\nTop picture credit: AFP via Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

2025-10-18T23:34:33.570+00:00\n\nTitle: D4vd: Mystery deepens after missing schoolgirl found dead in pop star's Tesla\n\nThe day after a body was found in his car in Hollywood, singer D4vd was belting his TikTok hit Romantic Homicide - a brooding breakup song about killing an ex with no regret - to a sold-out crowd in Minneapolis.\n\nThe US recording artist had self-launched his music career from his sister's closet while working a part-time gig at Starbucks. It led him to viral fame, millions of followers online, and a global tour.\n\nBut all of it came to an abrupt halt last month with the discovery of a severely decomposed body in the front trunk of his Tesla.\n\nThe corpse was identified as that of 15-year-old runaway Celeste Rivas Hernandez.\n\nA month later, mystery still surrounds the teen's death, as well as her relationship to the 20-year-old singer, whose legal name is David Anthony Burke.\n\nDeep dives into his macabre oeuvre - which is peppered with references to death, remembrance, violence and bloody motifs - have led some to question if life was imitating art and vice versa.\n\nThe young singer has yet to publicly comment on the case or the grim discovery in his car. His spokesperson has only said that that he is \"fully cooperating with authorities\" and he has since hired a prominent criminal defence attorney who has represented celebrities such as Mel Gibson, Lindsay Lohan, Kanye West and Britney Spears.\n\nRepresentatives for the singer - including his lawyer Blair Berk, Universal Music Group, Darkroom Records and Sony Music Publishing - did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.\n\nRivas Hernandez's cause of death has yet to be determined.\n\nThe county's medical examiner has said her body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found and has deferred making a ruling on how she died - an investigation they say could take months.\n\nPolice have also not named a suspect or person of interest in case, even weeks after discovering her body.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has not offered many details in the case or the probe, calling it an open death investigation. The department would not comment on multiple questions posed by the BBC about the case, the investigation and any connections the singer may have to Rivas Hernandez.\n\n\"It's just such a strange one,\" Neama Rahmani, a former prosecutor and Los Angeles attorney, told the BBC. \"It keeps getting more bizarre each day that goes on without an arrest.\"\n\nThat lack of information has also seemed to fuel intrigue. Fans, true-crime enthusiasts and internet sleuths have launched their own inquiries, locking in on details that appear to connect the teen girl with the gamer-turned-songwriter, who was once heralded by GQ as a \"Mouthpiece for Gen-Z Heartache\".\n\nRivas Hernandez - who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had last been reported missing by her family in April 2024, but it was not the first time she had run away from their Lake Elsinore home.\n\nA first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, neighbours recognised her as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda,  according to the Los Angeles Times .\n\nShe first went missing on Valentine's Day 2024, and her family filed a missing persons report the next day.\n\nPosters of her face were put up in her neighbourhood and her mother posted pleas on Facebook in Spanish for her return - public overtures that apparently irked the teen.\n\nOver the next two years, her parents would file at least two more missing-persons reports.\n\nHer family and friends told the newspaper that every time Rivas Hernandez ran away, she would eventually return and blend back into her life as a middle schooler.\n\nWhen the teens' remains were found in a bag in D4vd's Tesla on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.\n\nShe also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.\n\nThe decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.\n\nHer family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, has said they are \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They have since solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place earlier this month.\n\nD4vd's rise to stardom - fuelled by TikTok and online gaming - is a paradigm for his generation.\n\nGrowing up near Houston, Texas, he was home-schooled and said he exclusively listened to gospel music until he was 13. He became an avid Fortnite player in 2017 and launched his music career using pop songs to soundtrack gameplay montages that he posted on YouTube.\n\nHe started making his own music when he ran into copyright hurdles, beginning by recording songs on The BandLab app in 2021 and uploading his work on SoundCloud.\n\nSoon, he saw his music breaking through with thousands of listens. He then released what would become his two biggest hits thus far: Romantic Homicide and Here With Me.\n\nThe songs went viral on TikTok and led to billions of streams on Spotify, where he has amassed 33 million monthly listeners.\n\nHe signed with Darkroom and Interscope Records and released his debut EP, Petals and Thorns, in 2023. That same year, he landed on Variety's Young Hollywood list and opened for SZA on her SOS tour.\n\nLast spring, he made his Coachella debut - known as the festival for up-and-coming talent to break into mainstream fame. He was also commissioned by Fortnite - which he has said shaped his story as an artist - to create the game's first official anthem, Locked & Loaded.\n\nBut this ascent to fame came to a pause when his Tesla was towed to an impoundment lot and  authorities found a bag inside the front trunk  that contained Rivas Hernandez's decomposing remains after someone complained about a foul smell.\n\nHis world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his sophomore album.\n\nLos Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.\n\nUS retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.\n\nBut while his career ground to a screeching halt,   authorities have been silent on the investigation into Rivas Hernandez's death.\n\nInvestigators have not released any new information in the case since 29 September.\n\nThe agency also said that it is  still unclear whether there is any criminal culpability beyond the concealment of her body .\n\nWhile online sleuths have been quick to speculate, legal experts say that there is still much we don't know.\n\n\"You have this connection to David that seems pretty strong,\" Mr Rahmani, the former prosecutor, told the BBC. \"There is a lot of smoke but look, he could be absolutely innocent and it could be someone else who had access to his vehicle.\"\n\nMr Rahmani said while there are many questions in this case, the biggest for him is \"what is taking the LAPD so long\".\n\n\"They haven't released any real information,\" he said. \"This isn't a good look for the LAPD and it's a terrible look for D4vd.\"\n\nHe added that a case like this has added pressures: it involves a teen girl's death, it has garnered global headlines, and the investigation involves a celebrity.\n\nMr Rahmani noted that technology and potential for video footage is likely to be a \"treasure trove\" for investigators. Telsa vehicles come with advanced technology that tracks vehicles, notifies users when things like the trunk is open and are also outfitted with a slew of cameras as part of its Sentry Mode systems.\n\nOn top of this, the Hollywood home where he was living also had cameras. When authorities searched the home last month, investigators took a DVR that stores video and other data from the surveillance system.\n\nMalden Trifunovic, the owner of the Hollywood Hills home D4vd was renting, has told the BBC that he has hired a private investigator to help uncover what might have happened inside his multi-million-dollar abode.\n\nD4vd's manager Josh Marshall, the founder of Mogul Vision, rented the home for D4vd and has distanced himself from the singer. He vehemently denied rumours that he is connected to the death investigation.\n\nIn addition to the mystery surrounding the cause of Rivas Hernandez's death, it is still unclear what relationship the teenager had with the 20-year-old singer.\n\nRivas Hernandez would have turned 15 the day before her body was found by police.\n\nIn California, the age of consent is 18.\n\nFamily, friends and those who knew her have told local media that she had been dating someone named David and said he was a music artist.\n\nA former middle-school science teacher blamed her last attempt to run away from home, in the spring of 2024, on her dating a music artist she'd met online.\n\n\"She's been missing since I taught her,\" the teacher said in a viral video after Rivas Hernandez's body was identified.\n\nOnline sleuths have also connected her to the singer in a number of ways, from their matching tattoos to photos he posted online that appear to show them together.\n\nBut D4vd has not addressed the rumours, nor have police.\n\nLike many who don't follow indie pop music, his landlord Mr Trifunovic said he had never heard of D4vd until news broke about the discovery. He didn't even know it was D4vd who was renting his home because the lease had been signed by the singer's manager, Mr Marshall.\n\n\"I share the same anxiety and desire to understand what happened to poor Celeste as everyone else does,\" Mr Trifunovic told the BBC.\n\nAlthough he said he trusts the LAPD to conduct a thorough investigation, he too, is anxious for information.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question that a crime was committed,\" he said.\n\n\"She did not place herself in the front trunk of the Tesla or move the vehicle to where it was found.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33pvlez6yjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:01:16.137+00:00","title":"How an old suitcase revealed a hidden family fortune, lost under Nazi rule","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antony Easton discovered a suitcase in his father’s flat in 2009 containing documents that revealed his father, Peter, was born Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, a member of a wealthy pre-war Jewish family in Germany.

hidden family fortune, lost under Nazi rule\n\nIt started with a suitcase hidden under a bed.\n\nIt was 2009, and Antony Easton's father, Peter, had recently died. As Antony started to engage with the messy business of probate, he came across a small brown leather case in his father's old flat in the Hampshire town of Lymington.\n\nInside were immaculate German bank notes, photo albums, envelopes full of notes recording different chapters of his life - and a birth certificate.\n\nPeter Roderick Easton, who had prided himself on his \"Englishness\" (and been an Anglican) had, in fact, been born and raised in pre-war Germany as Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, a member of one of the wealthiest Jewish families in Berlin.\n\nDespite hints about his father's origins growing up, the contents of the suitcase shone a light into a past that Antony knew almost nothing about. The revelations would lead him on a decade-long trail, revealing a family devastated by the Holocaust, a vanished fortune worth billions of pounds and a legacy of artwork and property stolen under Nazi rule.\n\nBlack-and-white photographs gave a glimpse of Peter's early life, far removed from his son's modest upbringing in London - they showed a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, mansions staffed by servants, staircases ornately carved with angels.\n\nMore ominously, one picture showed 12-year-old Peter Eisner smiling with friends, a Nazi flag rippling in the distance.\n\n\"I felt it was a hand reaching out from the past,\" says Antony.\n\nHe says his father was a quiet and serious man, if prone to bouts of anger. He avoided talking about his childhood and always shut down questions about his slight German accent.\n\n\"There were clues that [he wasn't] really like other people… There was a darkness around his world,\" says Antony.\n\nThe next big clue about Antony's family history came from a work of art.\n\nEnlisting the help of a friend who spoke fluent German, he asked her to dig into a company called Hahn'sche Werke, references to which were peppered among the documents in the suitcase. After searching online, she sent Antony a photo of a painting, depicting the inside of a large steelworks - seemingly owned by the business\n\nMolten metal glows hot on a conveyor belt, illuminating the faces of busy and attentive workers. It is an image of industrial power and might, from an era when Germany was hurtling towards decades of devastating war.\n\nThe 1910 painting, by the artist Hans Baluschek, was called Eisenwalzwerk (Iron Rolling Mill). It had been owned, and was likely commissioned by Heinrich Eisner, who had helped build the Hahn'sche Werke steel business into one of the most high-tech and sprawling companies in central Europe. The documents in the suitcase showed that this was Antony's great-grandfather.\n\nMore research revealed that, at the turn of the 20th Century, Heinrich was one of the wealthiest businessmen in Germany - the equivalent of a modern multi-billionaire.\n\nHis company manufactured tubular steel, with factories spread across Germany, Poland and Russia.\n\nHeinrich, and his wife, Olga, owned several properties in and around Berlin, including an impressive six-storey property in the city centre with marble floors and a cream-white facade.\n\nA photograph from the early 1900s shows a man with a softly rounded belly and a straight white moustache. Heinrich wears a black suit, and Olga sits next to him, crowned with a crystal tiara.\n\nWhen he died in 1918, Heinrich left shares in his company - and his personal fortune - to his son Rudolf, recently returned from fighting in World War One.\n\nThe war had been a human catastrophe, but Hahn'sche Werke had prospered in that period, satisfying the German military's demand for steel. Rudolf and his family also successfully weathered the economic and political chaos which haunted their country after the fighting.\n\nHowever, in a few years, all would be lost.\n\nIn notes found by Antony in the suitcase, Peter recalled overhearing conversations between his parents, and whispers about Nazi threats. Jews were being blamed by Adolf Hitler and his supporters for Germany's defeat in WW1, and for the economic travails that followed.\n\nRudolf Eisner believed he would be safe if he made his company invaluable to the Nazi regime. For a time, this seemed to work, but as anti-Jewish laws became more and more extreme, and the abuse they witnessed around them worsened, he began to reconsider.\n\nIn March 1938, the government came after Hahn'sche Werke. Under immense pressure from the authorities, the Jewish-owned company was sold at a fire-sale price to Mannesmann, an industrial conglomerate whose CEO, Wilhelm Zangen, was a Nazi supporter.\n\n\"It is almost impossible to quantify the wealth stolen and how much those assets are worth today,\" says David de Jong, author of the book Nazi Billionaires, which retraces the looting of Jewish businesses under the Third Reich.\n\nIn 2000, Mannesmann was taken over by Vodafone in a deal worth more than £100bn - the largest commercial acquisition on record at the time. At least a portion of the industrial assets included in that sale would have once been part of the Eisner business empire.\n\nThe dismantling of Hahn'sche Werke, and the arrest of members of the company, made the Eisners realise they needed to flee. But by 1937, any Jew who tried to leave Germany was forced to surrender 92% of anything they owned to the state - paying a host of levies known as the Reichsfluchtsteuer or Reich Flight Tax.\n\nThe Eisners faced losing what remained of their wealth.\n\nAt the height of this crisis, a man named Martin Hartig, an economist and tax adviser according to records in Berlin's archives, began to loom large in the Eisners' lives.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, his name had featured repeatedly in the guest book at the Eisner country estate, thanking them for their generous hospitality.\n\nHerr Hartig, who wasn't Jewish, appears to have offered the family a solution to the impending confiscation of their assets by the Nazis. They signed over key elements of their personal fortune to him - chiefly the multiple properties they owned and their contents - thereby sheltering them from laws targeting Jews.\n\nAntony believes his grandparents assumed Hartig would one day give the assets back to them.\n\nThey were wrong. Instead, he permanently transferred the Eisner assets into his own name.\n\nThe BBC found copies of the original sales documents in Germany's federal archives and shared them with three independent experts. All three concluded that this deal was evidence of a \"forced sale\" - a term widely used to describe the dispossession of Jewish assets under the Nazis.\n\nDespite losing the fortune they had built over generations, Antony's grandparents and father managed to escape Germany in 1938. Train tickets, luggage tags and hotel brochures preserved in Peter's suitcase allowed Antony to retrace their journey.\n\nThe family went to Czechoslovakia and then Poland, barely staying one step ahead of the Nazis, before catching one of the last ships bound for England in July 1939.\n\nThey had lost the equivalent of billions, but they were among the luckier members of the Eisner family. Most of their relatives were rounded up and killed in concentration camps. Rudolf himself died in 1945 after having spent most of the war - like many other German refugees - interned by the British on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe next step for Antony was to find out what had happened to the Eisner family fortune, and to Martin Hartig.\n\nHe hired an experienced investigator, Yana Slavova, to find out what exactly had been stolen, how it had changed hands, and where it was today.\n\nWithin weeks, Yana had uncovered troves of documents about his relatives, including details of their properties and possessions.\n\nShe was able to trace the painting Antony had discovered at the beginning of his journey. Eisenwalzwerk was in the collection of the Brohan Museum in Berlin.\n\nEarly attempts to reclaim the artwork ran into problems regarding the evidence. Could Antony prove that its sale was tied to Nazi persecution? How did he know it hadn't changed hands multiple times legitimately before ending up in the museum?\n\nA breakthrough came when Yana unearthed correspondence between the museum and an art dealer at the time of the sale.\n\nThe art dealer had sold the painting from one of the Eisners' former family homes - a property taken over by Martin Hartig in 1938. Hartig had lived the rest of his life there, meticulously restoring the building after damage during the fall of Berlin, before dying of natural causes in 1965.\n\nAfter Hartig's death, the property passed to his daughter, who was now in her 80s. She had gifted the house to her own children in 2014, and had moved to a country cottage, where she arranged to meet Antony and Yana.\n\nThe elderly lady made them tea and cakes, which they ate in the living room under a portrait of her father - a man with thick-rimmed glasses and oiled hair, gaunt in the face and wearing a black suit. It had been painted in 1945, just after the end of World War Two.\n\nMartin Hartig's daughter had a very different story to the one Antony and Yana were expecting.\n\nShe told them her father had always been opposed to the Nazis and had helped save the Eisners, who she described as great friends, from the Holocaust. She said he helped convince them to get away, urging the family: \"You can't stay here. Go to Great Britain, to London.\"\n\nHer father had also told her he helped them smuggle paintings out of Germany by taking them out of their frames and hiding them among clothes.\n\nWhen asked about the properties her family took over from the Eisners in 1938, she said they were all legitimate purchases.\n\n\"My father bought two houses, legally,\" she said. \"It always had to be very correct.\"\n\nOther members of the family were more open to the possibility that their ancestor may have exploited the Eisners.\n\nVincent, Martin Hartig's great-grandson, is in his 20s and training to be a carpenter.\n\nHe admitted to feeling that his home, where Antony's grandparents once lived, may have had an uncomfortable past.\n\n\"I mean of course I was curious at some point - where does it come from that we as a family live in this nice place,\" he said. \"I've also asked myself the question, how were the circumstances?\"\n\nAfter discovering what happened to Antony's Jewish family, Vincent said he thought the Eisners had little choice when they passed their property to his great-grandfather.\n\nAntony has no recourse for filing a restitution case for his grandparents' property.\n\nHis grandmother, Hildegard - Rudolf's widow - tried to reclaim it in the 1950s, but backed down after a legal challenge by Hartig. The statute of limitations for Jewish victims of Nazi persecution to claim properties in former West Germany has also now passed.\n\nFor the artworks taken from the Eisner family, however, there is still hope for recovering what was lost.\n\nEarlier this year, the Brohan Museum in Berlin informed Antony that it intended to return the Eisenwalzwerk painting to the descendants of Henrich Eisner. The museum declined an interview with the BBC while the process remains ongoing.\n\nAnother painting has been returned to Antony from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and a third claim for an artwork in Austria also remains outstanding.\n\nAmong the evidence Antony's investigation has unearthed is a list made by the Gestapo, detailing specific artefacts and paintings which were seized from his relatives. There is a chance his family could find and reclaim more assets in the future.\n\n\"I've always said about restitution, it's not about objects and money and property, it's about people,\" says Antony. In researching his family's past, he has recovered detailed knowledge of who his father and his grandparents once were.\n\n\"All of this process has turned them into real people, who had real lives.\"\n\nThis knowledge has now been passed on to a new generation. The Eisner name may have disappeared when Peter sailed to Britain in 1939, but it now lives again. Antony's great-nephew, Caspian, born in August 2024, was given the middle name of Eisner.\n\nAntony says he was deeply moved by his niece's decision to honour their long-lost family.\n\n\"You know, as long as Caspian's around, that name will still be around with him,\" he says. \"People will say, 'that's an interesting middle name - what's the story there?'\"\n\nListen to  The House At Number 48  on BBC Sounds"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33pelk6pmlo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"23:53:52.393+00:00","title":"How BBC secret filming exposed a £28m timeshare fraud","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A £28 million timeshare fraud involving over 3,500 elderly British victims was uncovered through secret filming by BBC Scotland Investigates in 2016. The company Sell My Timeshare (SMT) used a bait-and-switch scheme, misleading owners into paying large upfront fees for non-existent property resale options and instead offering fake 'Monster Rewards' credits. The investigation, led by journalist Fergus Muirhead, revealed that victims—many aged 60 to 80—were subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and left with unusable contracts and significant financial losses.

More than 500 of them lost over £10,000, and one handed over more than £80,000.\n\nThose targeted were subjected to high-pressure sales meetings lasting up to six hours. They were left out of pocket, owning useless fake \"credits\" and still locked into expensive timeshare contracts they often could no longer use.\n\nThe company at the centre of the fraud was Sell My Timeshare (SMT). They took people's money to fund the owners' lavish lifestyle of private schools, millionaire mansions and private jets.\n\nThe man at the top of the company, Mark Rowe, was given a seven-and-half year sentence in January for conspiracy to defraud.\n\nOn Friday, his wife Nicola was one of the final three to hear their sentences.\n\nShe received a two-year suspended jail sentence at Southwark Crown Court after pleading guilty to money laundering.\n\nThis has been a long time coming and represents a huge win for the people who spoke out, the police and prosecutors.\n\nNine years ago, I made a programme for the  BBC Scotland Investigates  strand which exposed through secret filming the way SMT fleeced its victims.\n\nAlmost a decade on, the end of the criminal process brings some closure to those who were ripped off. But it's worth knowing how the fraudsters were able to get away with it for so long.\n\nI first heard about SMT in the summer of 2016. I was working in the investigations unit of BBC Scotland News, making current affairs and investigative documentaries.\n\nA friend mentioned that his mum had inherited the use of a timeshare apartment in Spain and, after years of holidays there, had begun looking to get out of the contract.\n\nIt's worth mentioning here how popular timeshares had become with British holidaymakers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTimeshares allowed people to access the same accommodation every year, or swap their weeks with other owners who had properties in other resorts. About 600,000 sun-lovers took up that opportunity.\n\nThe first timeshare rush was accompanied by a lot of stories about rip-off merchants mis-selling properties. They became a staple of consumer and investigative TV programmes such as Watchdog and The Cook Report.\n\nThe typical timeshare contract tied investors in for decades.\n\nBy 2016, those owners who had enjoyed their guaranteed place in the sun for 20 or 30 years were ageing, and many were looking to wave goodbye to their timeshares.\n\nSome had declining mobility and couldn't get to their properties. Some just felt they'd got all they wanted from them. And some had died, in many cases leaving their loved ones to inherit the contracts - including their annual payments and maintenance fees.\n\nAnd that's where my friend's mum had found herself. She searched the web for answers and found SMT, a company whose website promised to get her out of her contract.\n\nBut, having paid a fee and booked a meeting with them, her family smelled a rat.\n\nFurther research revealed hundreds of people saying they had paid money and got nothing out of it. In fact, they had lost money. A lot of it.\n\nOur team began investigating what was going on. It quickly became clear that there were some shady characters operating in the timeshare resale sector.\n\nOne lawyer had hundreds of individual complaints waiting to sue SMT.\n\nWe spoke to people who had used the firm and they all told the same story. They thought the company would buy their property off them but when they went to a consultation (for which they paid up front) they were told there was no re-sale value.\n\nInstead, they were encouraged - in fact pressured - to spend more money investing in \"Monster Rewards\", named after the outfit's parent company, Monster Travel.\n\nWhat exactly these were was not exactly clear. They sounded like a kind of currency, giving access to discount travel and services and shopping deals\n\nAnd they were apparently \"tradable\" with other owners, some time down the line.\n\nInvesting money up front now would result in an eventual payoff that would cover SMT's fees and leave the property owner in profit, freed at last from their pesky contract.\n\nToo good to be true? Well, yes.\n\nIf these accounts were true, this was a massive scam.\n\nIt's what is called a \"bait-and-switch\".\n\nSomeone - in this case SMT - \"baits\" the customer by advertising a particular product or service only to then say that's not available, pushing the client towards another, inferior, product or service.\n\nThat's illegal. Armed with all the testimony we had collected, we made the case to secretly film one of the company's meetings.\n\nThis takes time, effort, and clear arguments for why this is the only way to gather the information needed to prove wrongdoing.\n\nArmed with that permission, our small team set up a meeting with one of the company's representatives in Stratford-Upon-Avon.\n\nPosing as a member of the public hoping to get his mum out of her timeshare contract, our presenter, the personal finance journalist Fergus Muirhead, filmed the entire three-hour encounter.\n\nAnd everything went exactly as we'd been told.\n\nFor a start, Fergus was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, designed to stop him revealing anything that was discussed in the meeting.\n\nAny idea the company would be able to sell the (fictional) property was soon dismissed. The only way out of it would be through Monster Rewards - and to get them, he would have to cough up £6,740 on the spot.\n\nIn the great traditions of British journalism, we made our excuses and left.\n\nWe broadcast the programme on 24 October 2016.\n\nIn the run up to transmission we gave SMT a right of reply to our allegations about their illegal business practices.\n\nThey denied any wrongdoing and questioned both the transparency and probity of our sources. They said our allegations were defamatory and they reserved the right to pursue legal action against the BBC.\n\nWhat they didn't know, until the moment  we published the online news piece  ahead of transmission, was that we had everything on tape.\n\nWe never heard from them again.\n\nWithin days of broadcast, we were contacted by police who were already investigating SMT. They were looking to get hold of our footage of the recorded meeting.\n\nAs journalists, we have to be careful about handing over to the police material which we have collected for our reporting. We must remain independent, and the BBC will not normally hand over unused material in such circumstances without a court order.\n\nSo we waited until they were granted a court order for the material, which we then complied with. And that was the last we heard of the matter for the next three-and-half years.\n\nAs the nation headed towards the first Covid lockdown in February 2020, we were informed that 19 people connected to the firm had been arrested.\n\nFergus and I were asked to give witness statements. We spent the next five-and-a-half years never knowing whether we would be called, or knowing what was going on.\n\nIt was only with the end of the judicial process this week that we learned there had been four trials over two years at Southwark Crown Court in London. Reporting restrictions were in place until the final guilty pleas were lodged.\n\nIn total, there were 14 convictions.\n\nAmong those was 60-year-old Josephine Cuthill-Fox, the woman we filmed in 2016. She received 24 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will now turn to pursuing the money and assets gained by the defendants through their crimes.\n\nThis story isn't over yet."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd670x96600o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:51:25.015+00:00","title":"As Andrew gives up titles, what difference will it really make?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has formally renounced his titles and honours, including the Duke of York title, following sustained public and royal pressure over his past ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

2025-10-18T22:51:25.015+00:00\n\nTitle: As Andrew gives up titles, what difference will it really make?\n\nWe're unlikely to see Prince Andrew at a royal public event now for at least six months. And then maybe only once or twice a year.\n\nBanned from royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham he won't be on the annual church walk. It could be April 2026, at the Easter church service, before he reappears on such a family occasion, maybe longer.\n\nBut when he resurfaces, how much will his life have really changed, despite the drama of the loss of his titles and honours?\n\nThe move against Andrew followed a public outcry for some kind of sanction and there's certainly been a powerful symbolic message of displeasure - but will it really end the accusing headlines and will his daily life be much affected?\n\nBuckingham Palace will hope that this will be seen as a decisive intervention, ending the drip-drip of scandal.\n\nThe King was in Scotland when Andrew made his decision on giving up his titles and reportedly spoke to his brother on the phone.\n\nHe had consulted Prince William, who has all the warmth of an ice age for his uncle Andrew. When William is eventually on the throne, Andrew's royal appearances might be reduced from rare to never.\n\nIt had been William who had already intervened to stop Andrew from walking in the Order of the Garter procession.\n\nThere has been a colossal loss of reputation for Prince Andrew and he'll keenly feel no longer being able to use the Duke of York title and to take part in the Order of the Garter. He's become a persona non-garter.\n\nIt's a deep blow to his pride. But on a day-to-day basis, he's still a prince and he's still living in a mansion in Windsor. Royal Lodge has got a lease until 2078, so if he leaves it will be his own choice.\n\nLiving with him still will be his ex-wife, who is now also an ex-duchess. They've gone back to the position when they first met, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.\n\nHis downfall has been driven by  his links with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . But while Andrew has lost his status, if he ever looks at the infamous photo of him and Virginia Giuffre, everyone else in the picture - Ms Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell - and the person who was claimed to have taken it - Epstein - are either dead or in prison. The prince is the only one who has walked away.\n\nHe can still spend his days watching aviation videos or TV shows. His family life with his daughters, who are still princesses, can continue unchanged.\n\nHis statement about not using his titles, more or less a resignation letter, didn't have any flicker of remorse, continuing to assert his sense of duty and honour. So no change there.\n\nWhen Andrew had to stop being a working royal, in the wake of his Newsnight interview, there was an expectation that he might take the time-worn approach of quiet contrition and some charity work, to gradually regain public respect.\n\nInstead he showed no sense of regret. A royal insider, asked about Andrew's chances of a dignified return to public life, simply said to me: \"The grand old Duke of York, he gave 12 million quid, to someone he never met, for something he never did.\"\n\nIt meant he had never really accepted responsibility for what had happened. Several years later, the only thing that's changed is that he's no longer the Duke of York.\n\nThe intense pressure applied this week by the Palace to Prince Andrew to accept the loss of titles was driven by two key factors, according to royal sources.\n\nFirst, the Palace wanted to stop the cacophony of terrible headlines about Andrew that kept drowning out the rest of the Royal Family's work. They wanted a line drawn under the scandals.\n\nAnd second, there was genuine disquiet at the discovery that Prince Andrew had stayed in touch longer with Epstein than he had previously admitted. If that part of his account was unreliable, what else might emerge?\n\nGetting Prince Andrew to renounce the use of his titles, under the threat of forcibly taking them away, was an attempt to publicly show that the Palace was taking this seriously. They would put an end to his remaining links with royal life.\n\nAlthough this made headlines around the world, it won't stop the underlying questions about Prince Andrew and Epstein and the accompanying headlines.\n\nThis week will see the publication of the  posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre , an Epstein victim who claimed to have been forced to have sex with Andrew.\n\nThe prince has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, but the questions for Andrew about Ms Giuffre and Epstein seem to be getting louder than fading away. There could also be questions about what the Palace did or didn't know about Andrew and Epstein's circle.\n\nWhether he's called a prince or an ex-duke, he could still be caught up in the public and political pressure to reveal more documents about Epstein, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe press will keep pulling on other threads, like  Andrew's business dealings with China . Whatever the Palace hopes, the headlines are unlikely to stop.\n\nAt the centre of it all is Prince Andrew, saying nothing now apart from his terse statement, written through gritted teeth, about his titles.\n\nBefore his Newsnight interview in 2019 he had been much more open to talking to the media. I remember speaking to him at an event in 2017 encouraging entrepreneurs.\n\nLooking back it seems unintentionally prophetic.\n\n\"One of the things that I was taught at school was that the best way of being successful is to fail,\" he'd said.\n\n\"If you can learn about failure, and do it in such a way that it's a safe environment… then you will have learnt something, you will have experienced something.\n\n\"How many times did you put your finger in the plug socket as a small child and say 'ow' - and you never did it again.\n\n\"If you did it a second time, you'd think that was really stupid. They've failed and then they've learned what not to do next time,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"You're always stronger from failure.\" Is that a lesson he was ever good at learning?\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.\n\nMr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\n\n\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"\n\nMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student.\n\nKinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull.\n\nOn the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned.\n\nMr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".\n\nTwo years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence.\n\nThroughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges.\n\nHis supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime.\n\nMr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated.\n\nEarlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.\n\nBut Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence.\n\nThe family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said.\n\nThe facts of the case are different now, she stressed.\n\nBut when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility.\n\nWhile he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.\n\nICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation.\n\nMr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\n\n\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"\n\nThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best.\n\nWhile he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.\n\nHis community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada.\n\n\"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"\n\nMr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\n\n\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"21:55:30.036+00:00","title":"No Kings protests draw huge crowds at anti-Trump rallies across US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Massive anti-Trump protests took place across major U.S. cities including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles, with the New York Times Square rally drawing over 20,000 participants.

Donald Trump's policies in cities across the US - among them New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.\n\nThe rally in New York City's iconic Times Square drew thousands of people not long after it began on Saturday morning.\n\nThe streets and subway entrances were densely packed with protesters holding signs with slogans like \"Democracy not Monarchy\" and \"The Constitution is not optional\".\n\nAhead of the demonstrations, Trump allies accused the protesters of being linked with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\".\n\nOrganisers and protesters out on Saturday said the events were peaceful.\n\nNon-violence is a core principle of No Kings events, the group states on its website, which urges all participants to de-escalate potential altercations.\n\nIn New York, sections of the crowd regularly erupted into chants of \"this is what democracy looks like\" as a near-constant drumbeat boomed in the background alongside cowbells and noisemakers.\n\nHelicopters and drones could be seen flying overhead, and police stood on the sidelines.\n\nThe New York Police Department said more than 100,000 people had gathered to peacefully protest across all five of the city's boroughs, and that no protest-related arrests were made.\n\nIn Times Square, a police officer standing by estimated that over 20,000 were marching down 7th Avenue.\n\nBeth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, said she had joined the New York protest because she feels outraged and distressed at what she called a \"move toward fascism and an authoritarian government\" happening under the Trump administration.\n\n\"I care a lot about New York City,\" she said.\n\n\"It gives me hope to be out here with many, many other people.\"\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has expanded the scope of presidential power, using executive orders to dismantle parts of the federal government and to deploy national guard troops to US cities despite objections by state governors.\n\nHe has also called on the administration's top law enforcement officials to prosecute his perceived enemies.\n\nThe president says his actions are necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and has dismissed claims that he's a dictator or fascist, as hysterical.\n\nBut critics warn some of the moves by his administration are unconstitutional and a threat to American democracy.\n\nMassimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said he was protesting because he is concerned the US is following the same path that his home country did in the last century.\n\n\"I am the nephew of an Italian hero that deserted the Mussolini army and joined the resistance,\" Mr Mascoli said.\n\n\"He was tortured and killed by the fascists, and after 80 years, I didn't expect to find fascism again in the United States.\"\n\nAmong his concerns, Mr Mascoli is particularly worried about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and healthcare cuts for millions of Americans.\n\n\"We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government,\" he told the BBC. \"We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer also joined in the protest.\n\n\"We have no dictators in America. And we won't allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy,\" Schumer wrote on X alongside photos of himself holding up a sign that read \"fix the health care crisis\".\n\nIn Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a keynote speech.\n\n\"We're not here because we hate America, we're here because we love America,\" he said to a crowd of thousands.\n\nAt the DC march, the BBC saw one man wearing a hat emblazoned with Trump's \"Make American Great Again\" slogan. He said he was visiting the city, and decided to check out the protest. The man declined to give his name, but said while he didn't really \"get it\", people had been civil. Shortly after, a woman shouted a derogatory comment at him.\n\nThe protests weren't confined to the US.\n\nThroughout Europe, there were also demonstrations Berlin, Madrid and Rome as people showed solidarity with their American counterparts. In London, several hundred protesters gathered outside the US embassy.\n\nThere were similar scenes in Toronto, where demonstrators near the US consulate waved signs including \"Hands off Canada\".\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday but teased on Saturday, Trump appeared to address the upcoming rallies.\n\n\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know – they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"\n\n\"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said ahead of the rallies, according to CNN. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"\n\nRepublican governors in several US states had placed National Guard troops on standby ahead of the protests.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday activated his state's National Guard, saying they would be needed due to the \"planned antifa-linked demonstration\" in Austin.\n\nThe move was denounced by Democrats, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: \"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do - and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.\"\n\nVirginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated, though local reports said troops were not present during the protest.\n\nIn Washington, DC, where the National Guard guard has been deployed since August at Trump's request, no troops were visible at the protest, although local police were.\n\nOne protester at the rally in the capital held up a sign that read \"I am antifa\".\n\nChuck Epes, 76, said it was a \"loaded\" term, and just meant he supported \"peace, daycare, liveable wage, healthcare\", as well as immigrants and people of colour.\n\n\"He's gaslighting everybody - or trying to, and it ain't working,\" he said.\n\nAmericans are deeply divided on Donald Trump.\n\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 40% approved of his performance as president, while 58% disapproved. This puts him about on par with his average approval rating during his first term, but lower than his 47% approval rating when he took office for the second time in January.\n\nIt is common for presidents to become more unpopular as their term wears on. Joe Biden had a 55% approval rating, according to Reuters/Ipsos, in January 2021. By October of that year, his approval had declined to 46%.\n\nWith additional reporting by Ana Faguy"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e471159vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"23:42:24.234+00:00","title":"Fentanyl: How the US is emerging from its drugs death epidemic","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl-related overdose deaths, with a 25% decline in fatal overdoses in 2024.

tried fentanyl as a troubled 18-year-old, growing up in the US state of North Carolina.\n\n\"I felt like literally amazing.  The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted,\" she remembers.\n\nThe little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.\n\nBut drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?\n\n\"It's scary to think about that,\" Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.\n\nIn 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.\n\nBut then came a staggering turnaround.\n\nIn 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.\n\nOne of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.\n\nIn North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.\n\nKayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.\n\n\"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history. And often we see that the crimes they're committing appear to fund the addiction they have,\" says Lt Jamaal Littlejohn.\n\nThis might make them a candidate for the LEAD programme, meaning they can get support to tackle their addiction, and can start thinking about secure housing and employment.\n\nThe proponents of LEAD say it isn't about being soft on crime. Drug dealers still go to prison in Fayetteville. \"But if we can get people the services they need, it gives law enforcement more time to deal with bigger crimes,\" argues Lt Littlejohn, who watched his own sister struggle with a substance use disorder.\n\nKayla has blossomed. She's such a long way now from the days when she used prostitution to fund her fentanyl habit. As part of the LEAD process, her criminal record has been wiped. She recently graduated as a certified nurse assistant, and is now working in a residential home.\n\n\"It's like the best thing ever. This is the longest time I've been clean,\" she says.\n\nCritical to Kayla's recovery has been treatment. She's been taking methadone for nearly a year when she tells her story to the BBC. \"It's keeping me from going back,\" she believes.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine are medications used to treat opioid use disorder.  They stem cravings and stop painful withdrawal. Nationwide, treatment has played a role in puncturing the overdose fatality statistics.\n\nIn North Carolina, it's been a game-changer: more than 30,000 people were enrolled in a programme in 2024, with numbers climbing in 2025.\n\nAt 09:00 at one of the Morse Clinics in the state capital of Raleigh, two or three people wait their turn in reception.\n\n\"The busiest time is 5.30am to 7am, so before work,\" says Dr Eric Morse, an addiction psychiatrist running nine clinics offering medication assisted treatment (MAT) in North Carolina. \"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day.\"\n\nThe clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes.\n\nThey'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.\n\n\"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly,\" says Dr Morse.\n\nThis is harm reduction.  So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling.  Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether.  And in time, many will taper off their medication too.\n\nNot everyone thinks this is the right approach.\n\nMark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic. He points out that illegal drug-taking starts with a choice.\n\nAnd he doesn't believe in harm reduction. In particular he's against treating opioid use disorder with medications like methadone or buprenorphine.\n\n\"You're replacing an addictive product with another addictive product,\" he says. \"If you have to take it in order to stay clean, it's still addictive. We've got to figure out how to get people to where they can do better – we can't leave them on drugs forever.\"\n\nHe favours abstinence treatment programmes, when drug users go \"cold turkey\".\n\nBut there's pushback from health professionals in North Carolina.\n\n\"I believe there are multiple paths to recovery,\" says Dr Morse. \"I'm not pooh-poohing abstinence-based treatment - except when you look at the medical evidence.\"\n\nDr Morse references  a Yale University study from 2023  analysing the risk of death for opioid users in a treatment programme compared to people not in treatment.  The study suggested that someone in abstinence treatment was as likely - or more more likely - to have a fatal overdose as a person who wasn't in treatment and was continuing to use street opioids like fentanyl.\n\nTreatment aside, another drug is helping.\n\nNaloxone is widely available, and used as a nasal spray it reverses the effect of an opioid overdose, helping someone breathe again. In North Carolina in 2024, it was administered more than 16,000 times. That's potentially 16,000 lives saved – and these are only the overdose reversals that have been reported.\n\n\"This is as close to a miracle drug as we can ever imagine,\" says Dr Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist specialising in street drugs at the University of North Carolina.\n\nMany users of narcotics like cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin want to know that what they're taking won't kill them. Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.\n\nBut the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.\n\n\"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years,\" he says.\n\nTesting drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.\n\n\"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age,\" he says.\n\nDr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.\n\nIt was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.\n\nJosh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\n\"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them,\" Stein reflects.\n\nThe upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the \"abatement of the opioid epidemic\". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.\n\n\"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative,\" says Governor Stein.\n\nMeanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.\n\nIn the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.\n\nAnd there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.\n\nNo one is complacent. Least of all Kayla.\n\nIn the grip of fentanyl for three long years, she never overdosed herself, but she did have to save her friends. Kayla's parents didn't know what to do with her.\n\n\"They kind of gave up on me - they thought I was gonna be dead,\" she remembers.\n\nKayla credits Charlton Roberson, her harm reduction mentor, as being instrumental in her recovery.  Her aim now is to taper off methadone and become medication- and drug-free. She also wants to find a job in a hospital.\n\n\"I feel more alive than I ever did when I was using fentanyl,\" she says.\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via  the BBC Action Line ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xg1jve73o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:42:39Z","title":"US to repatriate survivors of strike on 'drug-carrying submarine', Trump says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that the United States will repatriate two survivors of a strike on a 'drug-carrying submarine' to Ecuador and Colombia, claiming the vessel was loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics.

It reports that the Prince gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph also said Andrew \"sought to dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre.\n\nPrince Andrew has not commented on the new reports, and he has consistently denied all allegations against him.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that William, Prince of Wales was \"not satisfied\" with Andrew's decision to relinquish his titles - and would take a more ruthless approach including a ban on his uncle attending his future coronation.\n\nThe prince has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.\n\nOn Friday, the Andrew announced that he was voluntarily handing back his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.\n\nHe will also cease be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMs Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was aged 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001.\n\nAndrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in  an out-of-court settlement  in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him.\n\nSky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister, who took her own life earlier this year, would be \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew.\n\nBut Mr Roberts said he would like to see the King go a step further, saying: \"We would call on the King to potentially go ahead and take out the prince in the Andrew.\n\n\"I think anybody that was implicated in this should have some sort of resolve. They should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors.\"\n\nHe added that he would \"welcome any contact from the King, from members of parliament\".\n\nWhen Prince Andrew was born in 1960, he was automatically a prince as the son of a monarch. This could only be changed if a letters patent - a legal document authorised by the monarch - was issued by the King.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Prince Andrew said: \"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\n\n\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\n\n\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\n\n\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\n\nThe prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.\n\nThe prince has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Ms Giuffre.\n\nNext week a  posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre  will be published. It is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with her and Epstein.\n\nMs Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.\n\nShe alleged that she was forced to have sex with the prince at the house of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old.\n\nHer memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIn the book, she also writes that she agreed to a gag order.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was celebrating her platinum jubilee in 2022 - the first British monarch to reach the milestone - as the civil case against her son gathered pace.\n\n\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's platinum jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" Ms Giuffre writes in her book.\n\nMs Giuffre's brother, Mr Roberts, told BBC Newsnight: \"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia.\n\n\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice, and these monsters can't escape from it - the truth will find its way out.\"\n\nHe said this was \"a moment where survivors are not staying quiet any more\".\n\n\"It's just a joyous moment for them because we're finally getting some sense of acknowledgement, like 'this actually happened, what we're saying is the truth',\" Mr Roberts added.\n\nHe said there was \"so much more to be accomplished, especially here in the United States\".\n\nHaley Robson, a survivor of Epstein's abuse, said the prince losing his titles was \"long delayed\" but \"very appropriate\".\n\n\"I have moments of joyous tears,\" Ms Robson said. \"I'm just flabbergasted that something finally broke and somebody is finally holding accountability.\n\n\"This is why King Charles is King. He is showing the world, including America, what it looks like to have somebody held accountable.\"\n\nPrince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.\n\nIn a now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019, Prince Andrew said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.\n\nBut emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that he had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including sending a message that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"\n\nPrince Andrew is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078.\n\nHis ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

reports\" that Hamas is planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which it says would violate the ceasefire agreement.\n\nA statement released on Saturday said a planned attack against Palestinians would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement and \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\".\n\nThe state department did not not provide further details on the attack and it is unclear what reports it was citing.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel is currently in progress - all living hostages have been released and bodies of the deceased are still being returned to Israel.\n\nAlso part of the agreement, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\n\nWashington said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms.\n\n\"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\"  the statement said .\n\nHamas has not yet

no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.\n\nHe later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.\n\nLast week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.\n\nThe videos showed several men with guns line up eight people, whose arms were tied behind their backs, before killing them in a crowded square.\n\nBBC Verify could not confirm the identity of the masked gunmen, though some appeared to be wearing the green headbands associated with Hamas.\n\nOn Saturday,  Israel said it had received two more bodies from Gaza  that Hamas said are hostages, though they have yet to be formally identified.\n\nSo far, the remains of 10 out of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.\n\nSeparately on Saturday,  11 members of one Palestinian family were killed  by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.\n\nThe Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.\n\nThere are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.\n\nAt least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\n\nIn September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had  committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza .

San Francisco deployment remark\n\nSalesforce boss Marc Benioff apologised Friday for suggesting that US President Donald Trump should send National Guard troops to San Francisco.\n\nThe apology followed days of backlash against Mr Benioff for a comment he made ahead of his company's annual Dreamforce conference in the city.\n\n\"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans... I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,\" he said.\n\nThe saga comes amid the Trump administration's military deployments to US cities - many of which are led by Democrats. Trump on Friday asked the Supreme Court to overrule lower courts that blocked a National Guard deployment in Chicago.\n\nThe mood at the usually jubilant Dreamforce convention was dampened by cancelled appearances by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, as well as comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer.\n\nMr Benioff was dealt public rebukes from several Democratic politicians, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who once served as mayor of San Francisco and appeared on stage with Mr Benioff at last year's convention.\n\nOn Thursday, venture capitalist Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, telling the New York Times that their values \"were no longer aligned\".\n\n\"I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,\" Conway told the newspaper.\n\nAlthough Mr Benioff walked back his comments earlier in the week, the apology posted on social media on Friday appeared aimed at putting the controversy to rest.\n\n\"I remain deeply grateful to Mayor Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco,\" Mr Benioff said in his X post.\n\nBut he noted that his endorsement of a crackdown \"came from an abundance of caution\" around Dreamforce security, adding \"I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused\".\n\nSylvia Paull, a veteran Silicon Valley publicist, called Benioff \"typical\" of many tech CEOs who are not \"really political animals\" and tend to be transactional.\n\n\"It was going to hurt his sales.\"\n\nAnd that's not all.\n\n\"He's afraid he's going to lose his legacy,\" she said of his apology.\n\nMr Benioff, who also owns Time Magazine, has been a prolific donor to civic causes in San Francisco over the years.\n\nHis name graces one of the most prominent hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nIn 2018, he funded support for a San Francisco ballot measure aimed at raising corporate taxes to fund homeless services. It passed, despite controversy.\n\nAnd while he once held a fundraiser for Democratic Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against Mr Trump, Mr Benioff appeared with the sitting president during his state visit to London last month.\n\nMr Trump said Wednesday that San Francisco was one of the next targets on his list of places where he plans to deploy the National Guard, calling the city \"a mess.\"\n\nOn Friday, in an emergency appeal, the president urged the Supreme Court to permit him to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago.  Lower courts have blocked the deployment  there thus far, with an appeals court saying such a move would \"likely to lead to civil unrest\" and \"only add fuel to the fire\".\n\nThe court ruled that it had \"seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois\".\n\nOfficials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration to block the deployment, arguing it was a \"grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty\".\n\nThe administration has  recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon  in a move that also prompted lawsuits and protests. It previously sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington and parts of Tennessee.\n\nThe New York Times also reported this week that Salesforce pitched its services to the Trump administration as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ramps up the hiring of new officers amid a crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to Salesforce for comment.\n\nTrump administration official David Sacks, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, addressed Mr Benioff in a post on X this week, writing \"if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team.\"\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

to sea and sunk in Hawaii\n\nA historic Clydebuilt sailing ship has been towed out to sea off the coast of Hawaii and deliberately sunk, prompting outrage from maritime conservation groups.\n\nFalls of Clyde, built in 1878, had been moored as a museum ship in Honolulu since the 1960s but had fallen into a poor state of repair.\n\nThe  Honolulu Harbour Board confirmed  it had the ship towed into deep water about 25 miles offshore on Wednesday and then scuttled.\n\nThe news has been met with anger and dismay by campaigners who have spent more than a decade trying to bring the ship back to its birthplace to rebuild it.\n\nFalls of Clyde was the first in a series of eight iron-hulled ships built in the late 19th Century by the Port Glasgow shipbuilder Russell & Co.\n\nThe ship spent many years carrying various cargoes to and from the Far East and Australasia before moving to Hawaii.\n\nIn the early 20th Century it had steel tanks fitted and was converted into a tanker to carry paraffin to the islands, where it later became a floating fuel depot before being acquired by a museum in Honolulu.\n\nBut the ship was badly damaged by a hurricane in the 1980s, the maritime section of the museum closed down and for years it has been left slowly decaying.\n\nEnthusiasts in Scotland have spent a decade trying to bring the ship home for restoration, but were unable to reach an agreement with the harbour board which wants to redevelop the quay where it was moored.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Transportation said the operation to remove the ship began at dawn on Wednesday and it was sunk about 25 miles south of the harbour.\n\nIt said the vessel's name, wheel and bell were retained along with other artefacts which will be put on display.\n\nThe destruction of the historic ship has been widely criticised by maritime conservation groups both in the UK and the USA.\n\nFriends of Falls of Clyde, a group of supporters in Hawaii, described it as  \"a day that will go down in infamy\".\n\n\"It is almost inconceivable that this situation has been allowed to happen,\" the group posted on social media.\n\nThe group organised a farewell ceremony with bagpipers on Tuesday after learning that the ship was to be sunk the following morning.\n\nThe Tall Ship Glenlee, the charity that looks after another Clydebuilt sailing vessel moored beside Glasgow's Riverside Museum, said it was \"deeply saddened\".\n\nDavid O'Neill, from the Scotland based  Save Falls of Clyde campaign , said he was \"horrified\" at the behaviour of the authorities in Hawaii but had become resigned to the ship meeting such a fate after years of fruitless negotiation.\n\nHe first became involved in efforts to rescue the ship in 2015 when someone in Hawaii alerted him to its condition, prompting him to post an appeal on social media saying: \"Old Scottish lady needs a lift home.\"\n\nA Norwegian firm which operates heavy lift ships offered to transport Falls of Clyde back to Scotland for free, but the campaign was soon embroiled in a wrangle with the harbour board over insurance costs and other conditions.\n\nEarlier this year Mr O'Neill said an American firm won a contract to remove the ship from the  harbour and it also offered to transport it to Scotland for free.\n\n\"They didn't want to sink the ship - they had a conscience and a respect for maritime heritage,\" he said.\n\nBut the deal between the firm and the harbour board fell through, and the contract went instead to another company which then carried out the scuttling.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Transportation has been contacted for comment.\n\nMr O'Neill said he had seen a video showing the final moments of Falls of Clyde.\n\n\"She was towed out of harbour looking really elegant and stunning for a 147-year-old ship, unaided, not needing any pumps,\" he said.\n\n\"She was still afloat and for us that's representative that she was truly Clydebuilt.\"\n\nHe said he found watching the ship go down \"quite disturbing\".\n\n\"She goes down by the stern and most of the ship lifts out of the water, like in the Titanic movie.\"\n\nThe businessman is now concentrating his efforts on trying to bring home a Clydebuilt ship from a different era - the Type 21 frigate HMS Ambuscade.\n\nThe warship was built for the Royal Navy at the Yarrow shipyard in Glasgow in the 1970s, and saw action in the Falklands War.\n\nIt later sold to the Pakistan Navy where it served until it was decommissioned two years ago.\n\nMr O'Neill said he secured the frigate for free  after making a \"cheeky request\"  to the Pakistani government, and he is working on plans to return it to the Clyde to become a museum ship."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5q3439xpqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:45:54.301+00:00","title":"George Santos: 'Have a great life!'

Trump orders prison release of disgraced ex-congressman\n\nUS President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft.\n\nIn a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"\n\nThe former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023.\n\nSantos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported.\n\nHe served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\n\n\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.\n\nIn April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"\n\nHe reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.\n\nIn his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service.\n\n\"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old.\n\n\"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month.\n\nSantos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\n\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.\n\nHe was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.\n\nA report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.\n\nSantos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.\n\nEarlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned.\n\nThe letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"\n\nHe wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions.\n\n\"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n\n\"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"\n\nSantos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.\n\nTrump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.\n\nIn May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.\n\nHe also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.\n\nCommutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn97gjqgq9po","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:41:48.305+00:00","title":"Disappointment in Kyiv as Zelensky leaves White House empty-handed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House to discuss military support and peace negotiations ended in disappointment, as President Donald Trump shifted focus from confrontational rhetoric to a deal-oriented approach, emphasizing personal grievances and proposing a ceasefire that leaves Ukraine without critical support such as long-range Tomahawk missiles or binding security guarantees.

was close to being \"solved\".\n\nBut it was as Zelensky's flight was in the air that news of the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call began to emerge and, before its wheels were even on the Washington tarmac, we had the announcement that another summit between the two was in the offing.\n\nThe Ukrainians descended the steps, to be met with a low-key American greeting, and with their optimism, like a piece of waylaid luggage, lost somewhere en route.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the US president appeared to be running out of patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting he thought he might be stringing him along, that his continuing attacks on Ukraine were \"crazy\" and that he was growing \"very angry\" with him.\n\nBut Friday's meeting confirmed that the sense of frustration was gone.\n\n\"I think he wants to make a deal,\" Trump said, and then proceeded to repeat some of his old talking points, framing the conflict as, in essence, a personal gripe between two leaders.\n\n\"There's a lot of bad blood,\" he said.\n\nZelensky has learned from bitter experience that there are great risks in being seen to challenge Trump inside the walls of the White House.\n\nAnd so, the underlying tension was - once again - palpable as Trump, his secretary of state, the war secretary and treasury secretary looked on sternly, while prominent members of the MAGA (Make America Great Again)-leaning media clustered around the back of his chair.\n\nAs expected, Zelensky was careful to offer effusive praise for the host's prowess as a peacemaker and to repeatedly express his gratitude.\n\nFlattery is the currency of diplomacy in Washington nowadays.\n\nBut Zelensky also made it clear he did not share Trump's apparent confidence that Russia is acting in good faith.\n\n\"We understand that Putin is not ready,\" he said.\n\nThe outcome, though, appears to have been a foregone conclusion.\n\nTrump ended the day insisting that the war should simply be frozen on the existing battle lines and both sides should simply \"go home to their families\".\n\nFor Ukraine and its allies, the conflict is not a personal dispute but a war of aggression being fought by an authoritarian state, with imperial ambitions, against a European democracy.\n\nUkraine wants the US Tomahawk missiles to help it pressure Putin into genuine negotiations, and it wants US security guarantees to make sure he is forced to abide with any future peace settlement.\n\nZelensky left the White House without either of those things.\n\nWhat do Ukrainians think of it all?\n\nIn a suburb of Kyiv, recently hit by two Russian missiles, I spoke to some of the residents still working to repair the damage to their homes and businesses.\n\nI asked Volodymyr Tsepovatenko - still busy fixing windows that were blown out of the small shop he owns – for his views on where Ukraine stands after the latest White House meeting.\n\n\"If we make a peace deal now,\" he told me, \"Russia will start to prepare a new more professional war against Ukraine, or maybe other countries.\"\n\n\"I see one way for our safety and it's to destroy the possibility of Russia occupying or fighting any country in Europe.\"\n\nUkraine needs to keep fighting, he said.\n\nOleksandr Vilko's car was destroyed by the blast wave when the missiles struck. He is not too worried, he says, about the decision on the Tomahawks.\n\n\"The only power who decides what's going to be next is our army,\" he told me.\n\nWhile Ukraine is grateful for any assistance provided so far, he said, it was Washington's sovereign right whether or not to give Ukraine its own long-range missiles to fight back.\n\nBut with or without them, Ukrainians would fight on, he said.\n\n\"It's almost the fourth year of the war with the biggest country in the whole world,\" he said.\n\n\"And still we survived.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p7xzz4lvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:08:47.333+00:00","title":"What's next for Sarah Ferguson, Eugenie and Beatrice?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Prince Andrew’s loss of his Duke of York title due to his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former wife Sarah Ferguson has lost her duchess title and will now be known as Sarah Ferguson.

Eugenie and Beatrice?\n\nPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.\n\nHis ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.\n\nTheir daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.\n\nPrince Andrew  lost use of his Duke of York title  over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSo, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?\n\nFor Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.\n\nFor all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.\n\nAnd while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"\n\nBut the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.\n\nLast month,  several charities dropped her as patron  or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\n\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\n\n\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"\n\nAway from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.\n\nAnd these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\n\n\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revaluations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"\n\nBut Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.\n\nEven though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.\n\nThe Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.\n\nThat ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\n\n\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholls.\n\n\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"\n\nNicholls argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\n\n\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"\n\nFor the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.\n\nThey will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.\n\nThere is also no change to the line of succession.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.\n\nBut in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\n\n\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.\n\nBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\n\n\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.\n\nThey have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.\n\nPrince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\n\n\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\n\n\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholls.\n\n\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"\n\nUltimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.\n\nFor a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.\n\nSo to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"23:48:23.794+00:00","title":"MindsEye: How ex-Grand Theft Auto boss’s grand vision became a £200m flop","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the collapse of Build a Rocket Boy (Barb), a video game studio founded by former Rockstar Games executive Leslie Benzies, following the disastrous launch of its first game, MindsEye, in June 2025.

2025-10-18T23:48:23.794+00:00\n\nTitle: MindsEye: How ex-Grand Theft Auto boss’s grand vision became a £200m flop\n\nIn July this year workers at Build a Rocket Boy, a video game studio in Edinburgh, were called to an all-staff meeting.\n\nTheir first ever game, a sci-fi adventure called MindsEye, had been released three weeks earlier - and it had been a total disaster.\n\nCritics and players called it \"broken\", \"buggy\", and \"the worst game of 2025\".\n\nAddressing staff via video link, the company's boss,   Leslie Benzies, assured them there was a plan to get things back on track and said the negativity they'd seen was \"uncalled for\".\n\nThen he pivoted, alleging \"internal and external\" forces had been working to scupper the MindsEye launch.\n\nHe told the assembled workers - who'd been informed they faced redundancy just a week earlier - there would be an effort to root out \"saboteurs\" within the company.\n\n\"I find it disgusting that anyone could sit amongst us, behave like this and continue to work here,\" he said, according to a transcript of the meeting verified by BBC Newsbeat.\n\nStaff who worked at the studio say they were stunned - and not only by the strength of the language. They simply didn't believe him.\n\nAs far as they were concerned, there was no conspiracy - and the reasons for MindsEye's failure were clear.\n\nMr Benzies is well-known for his work at Rockstar Games where he was a senior figure on the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) action-adventure series, and regarded by many as a key architect of its success.\n\nHe left in 2016, three years after the record-breaking launch of GTA 5, sparking a legal row over unpaid royalties that was settled out of court.\n\nIn the same year, he set up the company that would become Build a Rocket Boy (Barb). By the end of 2024, it had grown to 448 employees.\n\nMost were based at its main office - a former casino in Leith, Edinburgh - but the company also had studios in Budapest and in the French city of Montpellier.\n\nFormer staff say salaries were competitive, the company allowed remote working, and their response to the Covid-19 pandemic was good.\n\nWith Mr Benzies at the helm, Barb attracted a lot of interest and, according to  documents UK companies are legally required to publish online , had managed to attract more than £233m of investment by 2024.\n\nIt had also spent large amounts of money without releasing any products.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, the company posted losses totalling £202.6m, with its largest for a single year - £59.1m - coming in 2023.\n\nBarb's first project was Everywhere, described by one former employee, Jamie (not their real name), as a multiplayer role-playing game (RPG) based in an open-ended, futuristic city.\n\n\"I thought we had something quite special,\" says Jamie, who left the company in 2022.\n\nTo fulfill the vision, Jamie says, Mr Benzies requested new ideas and features be added at breakneck speed - too fast for them to be properly implemented.\n\nThe studio's main focus would eventually shift to MindsEye - a game originally intended to be offered as an experience within Everywhere.\n\n\"Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,\" says Jamie. \"There was no coherent direction\".\n\nThis style of working \"plagued the project from the start\", they say, and would be a sign of things to come.\n\nAn open letter, recently signed by 93 current and former Barb employees, alleges studio management made \"radical changes\" without properly consulting workers.\n\nFormer lead data analyst Ben Newbon says it was common for staff to be caught off-guard by \"knee-jerk\" decisions from upper management without proper explanation.\n\nThe letter further alleges that leadership \"repeatedly refused to listen\" to its experienced workforce.\n\nBen, whose team was tasked with collecting feedback and presenting it to management, says there was rarely any response when they flagged issues.\n\n\"A lot of the points that we were hammering home on were just ignored and just never actioned,\" he says.\n\nHis former colleague, associate producer Margherita \"Marg\" Peloso, says the studio's culture also discouraged individuals from speaking out.\n\nMarg, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, says their own attempts to raise concerns were \"laughed at\" in meetings with bosses.\n\nStaff also accuse Mr Benzies of micro-managing the studio, a process allegedly illustrated in a  video uploaded to the official MindsEye YouTube account .\n\nIt shows the director instructing an onlooker to make a note of an issue he has noticed as he plays the game.\n\nDevelopers say this was a regular occurrence, resulting in what Ben and Marg claim were known within the studio as \"Leslie tickets\".\n\nJamie says they also heard them referred to as \"Leslie bugs\" or, simply, \"Leslies\".\n\nDevelopers told Newsbeat these could range from minor cosmetic issues to instructions to ditch whole missions from the game, and there was an expectation that these would be given top priority.\n\n\"It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on,\" says Ben, \"the Leslie ticket had to be taken care of.\"\n\nJamie says the practice introduced instability and prevented teams from \"taking ownership of their work\".\n\nDevelopers say the decision to launch MindsEye in June 2025 prompted a period of \"crunch\" - a games industry term for mandatory overtime.\n\nThey say this meant an extra eight hours of unpaid overtime a week for the majority of staff - although some employees were excused from it.\n\nMarg says the crunch began in mid-February and continued into May, with workers eventually being promised seven hours of leave per eight hours' overtime, to be taken after MindsEye's release.\n\n\"People just felt like they were being commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return,\" says Marg.\n\nBen alleges that some departments, such as the quality assurance team, were particularly affected, with some staff suffering physically and mentally as a result of the \"stress and pressure\".\n\nFormer audio programmer Isaac Hudd says \"mistakes started piling up\" during crunch, and says \"regressions\", where one team would fix a bug only for another to unwittingly bring it back to life, became increasingly common.\n\n\"And it does mess with you,\" he says. \"You really do start to see the morale go down, the little arguments starting to happen.\n\n\"People are burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: 'What's the point?'\"\n\nMarg says many at the studio expected MindsEye to receive a negative reception on launch, describing the approach to its release as \"everybody holding their breath\".\n\nNevertheless, staff gathered in Barb's Edinburgh studio to celebrate MindsEye's launch on 10 June.\n\nMarg says: \"Everybody was drinking champagne, just having a good time, which was quite… heartwarming, I guess.\n\n\"At the same time, it really felt like this is the last good thing that's going to happen.\"\n\nThe celebrations were short-lived.\n\nBarb had not shared advance copies of MindsEye with reviewers, but when early impressions of the game began to surface, the mood soured.\n\nPlayers who bought the game on release day encountered major performance issues and reported various bugs, including pedestrians that appeared to walk on air and, in one heavily-memed example, one character's face appeared to melt due to a graphical glitch.\n\nTwitch streamer CohhCarnage told viewers he was instructed to cancel a sponsored launch day stream at the last-minute, as word of the game's problems spread.\n\nAudio programmer Isaac says he had maintained some optimism in the run-up to the release, but started to lose hope fairly quickly.\n\n\"You were just seeing disastrous review after disastrous review, and thinking 'This isn't gonna go well',\" he says.\n\nMarg says the team spent the next two weeks working on \"hotfixes\" - small, targeted updates to address major issues, until management informed them that they were at risk of being laid off.\n\nThis month, between 250 and 300 Barb staff lost their jobs, with the bulk of those roles based in Edinburgh, according to The Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union's Game Workers Branch.\n\nThe union, which put out the open letter on behalf of 93 employees, said it also planned to take legal action against Barb over what it called \"disastrous mishandling\" of the redundancy process.\n\nBen, who is a member of the union, says he took voluntary redundancy, but fellow members Marg and Isaac, who were laid off, say they were unhappy with how their departures were handled.\n\nIn a statement, Barb said staff had \"poured passion, creativity, and hard work into our games and our studio\", adding that it was \"deeply saddened\" and \"didn't anticipate having to make redundancies after launch\".\n\nIt said it approached the redundancy process with \"care and transparency\", meeting all of its obligations, and was \"committed to learning and growing\" from former employees' feedback.\n\nIn response to complaints about studio leadership, workplace culture and claims of \"internal and external\" forces working against the studio, Barb said: \"Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for the initial launch [of MindsEye].\n\n\"The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.\"\n\nIt said it remained committed to \"ultimately delivering MindsEye as the game we always envisioned - and the one players are excited to play\".\n\nThe statement added that the studio had already rolled out updates to address issues, and was working on \"enhancements\" and \"fresh new content\".\n\nThe ex-workers who spoke to BBC Newsbeat say they are doubtful that MindsEye can recover from its launch.\n\nThey are also pessimistic about their own future prospects and those of former colleagues in an industry which has seen tens of thousands of job losses over the past three years.\n\nBen says the impact will be felt in the Scottish development scene, too.\n\n\"It's really sad to see what could have been an amazing opportunity for the industry up here wasted,\" he says.\n\nDespite the negativity around MindsEye and Barb, Isaac says, some of his colleagues were \"incredibly talented\" and \"some of the best people\" he's ever worked with.\n\nMarg says they decided to speak out because of those colleagues - and in the hope something will change.\n\n\"We all know each other, and we know how much we're worth,\" Marg says. \"We need to stand together.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -
