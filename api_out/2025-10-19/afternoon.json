says \n       \n  By Ibrahim Dahman, Mitchell McCluskey, Lauren Izso, Jennifer Hansler, Kareem El Damanhoury, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:51 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a twelfth hostage returned to Israel from Gaza has been identified Sunday as Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, as the ceasefire that brought a pause to two years of destruction in the Palestinian enclave comes under strain.\n \n\n   \n  A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Sunday said Oakkharasri’s remains had been identified and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed his family. His was one of two bodies returned by Hamas on Saturday to Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The other body was earlier identified as that of hostage Ronen Engel, according to his kibbutz, and photographs provided to CNN by his family.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over the bodies of Engel and Oakkharasri to the Red Cross on Saturday, after which they were transferred to Israel for formal identification.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Ronen Engel,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz said in a statement. “We will always remember Ronen as a devoted family man, incurably optimistic, with a sense of humor, a joy for life, and a constant smile.”\n \n\n   \n  Oakkharasri was a Thai citizen who was taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 7, 2023. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in May 2024 that Oakkharasri was presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  Engel was 54 when he was killed, and his wife Karina kidnapped along with their daughters Mika and Yuval. His wife and children were released the following month, but Engel’s body was not.\n \n\n   \n  The truce in Gaza appears to be largely holding as it enters its second week, but has come under pressure from the delayed return of the remaining hostage bodies from Gaza, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and Israel’s continued deadly strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department said Saturday that “credible reports” indicate Hamas is planning an “imminent ceasefire violation” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the media note said. “The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Hamas said in a statement Sunday that it “reaffirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement” and “stresses that (Israel) continues to breach the agreement and fabricate flimsy pretexts to justify its crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the State Department’s memo.\n \n\n   \n  With the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which went into effect last week. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not rest and we will not be silent until the last of the hostages is returned,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Protests have ignited in Israel as frustration  intensifies  over the delay in returning the bodies of the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, large crowds of demonstrators gathered on Saturday, urging the government to pressure Hamas to release the bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access and that “extensive efforts and special equipment” would be needed to retrieve more. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Israel believes  that Hamas  does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. Israel’s foreign minister has accused Hamas of trying to use the hostages’ bodies as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Channel 14 on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would end once all of the hostage bodies have been returned and Hamas is demilitarized.\n \n\n   \n  “The war in Gaza will finally end when the terms of the agreement that was supposedly accepted are implemented, and this includes, first of all, Phase A - the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Phase B also includes the disarmament of Hamas, or rather the disarmament of the Strip, and before that the disarmament of Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n    Rafah crossing and crucial aid\n \n\n   \n  As the dispute continues, the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday. The crossing is a  crucial link  between Egypt and Gaza, serving as the enclave’s lifeline for humanitarian aid.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s office said that its opening would be dependent on how “Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas criticized the delayed reopening of the crossing as “a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.” The group also condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military targeted a vehicle carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, on Friday after it crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  After coordinating with the United Nations, the Civil Defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including those of four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/travel/robbery-louvre-paris-france-museum-closure-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Thieves steal ‘priceless’ jewelry from the Louvre in seven-minute raid","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a highly coordinated and audacious seven-minute raid on Sunday, October 19, 2025, thieves stole priceless jewelry from the Apollo Room of the Louvre Museum in Paris.

positioned as Trump pressures Venezuela \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has been steadily massing a large number of troops, naval and air assets in the Caribbean over the last two months, conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been shuttered for decades, and  attacking  speedboats carrying suspected drug traffickers from Venezuela and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, a significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally are also now located in  US Southern Command , the US military’s command responsible for operations in the region, according to a fleet tracker published by the United States Naval Institute’s news portal.\n \n\n   \n  That includes the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base. At least one AC-130J Ghostrider, a heavily armed plane capable of providing air support to ground troops, was  photographed  equipped with Hellfire missiles at José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Puerto Rico, which is used by the installation. A separate image,  captured  by a local photographer, appears to show another Ghostrider at the same facility. That airport has been  a staging ground  for US military operations in the region over the last several months.\n \n\n   \n  In a review of open-source flight data, CNN identified over 200 military flights conducted in the Caribbean over the two-month period between August 15 and October 15. The missions were carried out by 83 separate aircraft, including intelligence-gathering planes and tankers used to refuel jets in midair.\n \n\n   \n  Several intelligence gathering assets may also have been diverted from surveillance operations in Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, flight data suggests. Since August 22, three Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft used for signals intelligence gathering crossed the Atlantic into the Caribbean theater.\n \n\n   \n  In early October, “Little Bird” light attack helicopters first identified by the Washington Post and MH-60M Black Hawk helicopters were also spotted conducting training operations off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. The Little Bird is a highly specialized helicopter typically used by US Special Forces for covert missions.\n \n\n   \n  The huge buildup has raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. The administration has said repeatedly that the military presence is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign, but President Donald Trump has also been weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening leader Nicolas Maduro, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Experts generally agree that at this point, the US does not have enough assets or troops in place to launch an incursion to control Venezuela itself.\n \n\n   \n  “The military presence in the Caribbean is too big for just hitting a few speedboats, though it is not big enough for an invasion of Venezuela,” Elliott Abrams, who served as the US envoy to Venezuela during Trump’s first term, told CNN on Thursday. “What’s in the middle, I think, is a pressure campaign, meant to rattle Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The US does have the ability now to conduct strikes inside Venezuela from afar. Trump could order Tomahawk missile strikes, for example, from the guided-missile destroyers, cruiser and submarine stationed in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s enough to cause pain but not to seize terrain,” Peter Singer, a strategist and Senior Fellow at New America focusing on defense issues, told CNN, referring to the military buildup. “We’re not talking about an invasion and occupation force,” Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is not a military powerhouse, but it is a huge country with difficult and varied terrain. Hurricane season is not over, and the US has not fought a tropical war in two generations, a former US official with deep experience in the region said. And at this moment, the US does not dominate the airspace over Venezuela, the former official noted. Venezuela has S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-launched air defense systems, and F-16 fighter jets.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abrams, Singer said he believes “so much at this stage is about signaling and pressuring” Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, the US flew B-52 bombers near Venezuela’s coast for four hours on Wednesday, in what appeared to be a show of force. At their closest point, the bombers reached 48 miles from Los Roques, a small Venezuelan island archipelago of a few thousand residents.\n \n\n   \n  The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region, or FIR, that is international airspace, but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has also conducted several training missions in that area in recent weeks, including  live-fire training  and flight operations in the waters near Venezuela earlier this month, and at least five flights of a T-38 jet — used for pilot training — in the Caribbean since September 22, according to open-source flight data.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis, Thomas Bordeaux, Isa Cardona and Isa Soares contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/trump-brand-federal-government","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Brander in Chief: Trump puts his mark on the federal government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, leveraging his experience in branding and marketing from his real estate business, has applied those strategies to the federal government during his second term.

mark on the federal government \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made his money by slapping his name on hotels and products. Now he’s doing the same thing to the US government.\n \n\n   \n  There’s  TrumpRx , a website for prescription drugs. The  Trump Gold Card , a high-dollar ticket to citizenship. A  Trump coin . A  Trump fighter jet .\n \n\n   \n  Beginning with his decadeslong career in real estate, Trump has been deeply attuned to branding and marketing — capturing the public’s attention in simple but memorable ways.\n \n\n   \n  In his second term as president, Trump and his team have built upon that skill with a sophisticated operation — the federal government now utilizing the lessons learned at the Trump Organization. And the president has been hands-on, treating his administration like a business to be promoted — a precedent that could be adopted by future campaigns and administrations on both sides of the aisle, but that has raised concerns about the commoditization of the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most significant marketing effort in his political career has been MAGA: “Make America Great Again,” a tagline for his 2016 campaign adopted from a 1980 Ronald Reagan slogan. MAGA has subsequently become the signifier of a much broader political movement — spawning not just hats and T-shirts, but a rallying call and identity.\n \n\n   \n  “What Trump understands is how to capture attention. That is his master stroke,” said Camille Moore, a branding expert and influencer.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands that simplicity and repetition create stickiness. ‘Make America Great Again’ triggers aspirational feelings. These are very simple concepts that anybody can get behind, and that’s what the best branding is based on,” said Moore, who has worked with companies including Saks Fifth Avenue, Netflix and L’Oréal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team have sought to take that success beyond the Oval Office. There are the visual manifestations:  a proposed commemorative $1 coin  featuring the president’s likeness, a draft of which has been confirmed by the US Treasury. It’s not clear whether the design will be minted, since it’s against US law to display the image of a sitting president or living former president on a coin.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars have been  spent on banners  with portraits of Trump hung atop three federal buildings in Washington, DC, according to a report from Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.\n \n\n   \n  There are branded products, services and spaces: The president recently unveiled TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer website for discounted drugs set to launch early next year. The name, one White House official said, was the result of a brainstorming session and an effort to reflect Trump’s personal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was not involved in picking the name, but it was not a difficult one to land on. We thought it had a catchy element to it,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, said in the Oval Office earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  A $1 million immigrant visa called the “Trump Gold Card” promises to “unlock life in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Boeing is building a next-generation fighter jet called the “F-47,” a name that was chosen “in consultation with the Secretary of Defense” and honors the World War II-era P-47 aircraft, the founding year of the Air Force, and “the 47th President’s pivotal support for the development of the world’s first sixth-generation fighter,” according to a  statement  from an Air Force spokesperson obtained by Bloomberg News.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also called on US military officials to develop a “ Golden Dome ” defense system, a riff on Israel’s Iron Dome.\n \n\n   \n  And  he’s renovated  one of the White House’s most iconic spaces, the Rose Garden, rebranding it as the “Rose Garden Club” with exclusive dinners for officials, lawmakers and donors. The club has a bespoke logo and has been advertised on his official public schedule. That Trump-fostered exclusivity comes as tours of the People’s House for the general public  have been halted  due to construction on the president’s planned ballroom expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s taking an approach more like Nike or Apple than a politician, and that speaks to why it’s working. … He’s leveraging what businesses that make billions of dollars have proven to do,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  But unlike Nike or Apple, the US government isn’t a for-profit business.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has insisted he’s paying for White House renovations himself. At a Wednesday night dinner to thank high-dollar donors and investors for their support for his $200 million ballroom, he said the project had been fully funded. At the same dinner, he held up models for a new triumphal arch he’s involved in planning in Washington, DC — another mark of how he’s imposing his aesthetic on the nation’s capital. (It was not immediately clear how it would be paid for.)\n \n\n   \n  Politicians have long sought to take credit for their accomplishments and to make those actions clear to American voters.\n \n\n   \n  But Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the way Trump has gone about it has raised broader concerns about the president’s efforts to promote himself.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has really supercharged this and made it very much about his name and his identity, and has, in many ways, made the whole government a vehicle to promote him,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump branding does not directly violate any laws, but it does violate long-standing norms, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you add all of this up, it has the effect of mobilizing the government for the political benefit of a particular leader — and that has some dangerous implications, even if the specific examples are pretty minor in and of themselves,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is the driving force behind many of these efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these have been the president’s ideas, and he is the brander in chief. He’s an expert at marketing. That’s how he made a living and a fortune and created one of the most famous business empires in the world before being elected as president of the United States,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview with CNN. “All of these fun little names are his ideas, and he has a team who’s very much willing to bring them to life.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also used these principles over the years to coin monikers for his political opponents: Low Energy Jeb (Bush), Lyin’ Ted (Cruz), Crooked Hillary (Clinton), and Sleepy Joe (Biden).\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so simple. And it’s painfully memorable when your opponent is trying to be so thoughtful and prescribed. You can’t win against that,” said Moore.\n \n\n   \n  World leaders seeking to cultivate closer ties to Trump have also leaned into branding. A peace agreement between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan has  granted  the US rights to a new corridor: the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.\n \n\n   \n     Second term’s the charm \n \n\n   \n  Officials argue that Trump’s branding efforts have been amplified this term by a staff that has a better grasp on who Trump is.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big difference this go-round as compared to the previous. He’s a more known entity. And that has made picking up his lead and anticipating what he wants and what he likes and going with it as a branding tool very — not easy — but it’s a skill people have learned how to adopt,” said a White House official granted anonymity to speak freely.\n \n\n   \n  The official said many of the first-term political operatives with decades of expertise weren’t as willing to follow Trump’s less traditional lead.\n \n\n   \n  A second White House official echoed that sentiment: “It’s reflective of how MAGA went from a one-man show to a bigger, well-oiled machine. And the branding reflects how that’s one of the fruits of that investment that he’s made.”\n \n\n   \n  This time around, there has been an emphasis on hiring staff from outside of the Washington bubble who have more diverse backgrounds, including athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “I figured, if someone can make a 2-14 college football team look exciting, then what could they possibly do with legislation? That’s why the videos and a lot of the branded content, it looks different, it looks fresh, it looks like stuff people are use to consuming,” the first   official said.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration made its own attempts to brand its successes, including signage  crediting  then-President Joe Biden with construction projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. But the Biden White House largely struggled to connect the president’s achievements with voters.\n \n\n   \n     Reimagining social media  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump White House has also reimagined its role on social media, launching accounts with coordinated aesthetics that often push the envelope and troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike previous administrations, including Trump’s first, there are fewer layers of bureaucracy and approval chains before a post gets published, the first White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  That has prompted blowback on multiple occasions, including a recent racist video  social media post , which appears to be AI-generated, depicting House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache.\n \n\n   \n  But it has also allowed those accounts to be much more active, something that Moore said Democrats could learn from.\n \n\n   \n  “In the social media age, whoever is more nimble, whoever is faster on their feet, whoever understands social media better — who can pivot — is who can win,” she said, adding, “You have to lean into not being polished.”\n \n\n   \n     ‘I was a product’ \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s understanding of branding principles began early in his time at the Trump Organization, the overarching company of namesake hotel and real estate properties.\n \n\n   \n  “Someone recently said that I was a product — I didn’t mind the comment because the product that the name Trump represents is fantastic,” he  wrote  in a foreword to a “Trump University Branding 101” textbook, published in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “There is no way we can ignore the power of branding in the world market today — so take the time to establish your brand carefully.

Most of it comes from Brazil — 30.7% of US coffee imports based on net weight, according to the UN Comtrade Database — Colombia (18.3%) and Vietnam (6.6%).\n \n\n   \n  The average price of regular coffee at restaurants in August was  10 cents more  than the same time last year, according to data from Toast, a restaurant management software provider. The increase brought the average price to $3.52.\n \n\n   \n  Some relief may be on the way. In September, Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, introduced the bipartisan “No Coffee Tax Act” to exempt coffee products from tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Price hikes may cause some consumers to start brewing their coffee at home, but they will likely continue buying cups from local shops as occasional indulgences.\n \n\n   \n  “(Consumers) may change brands, or they may shop for deals, or perhaps go down in quality — or what they perceive as a quality level — in order to save a little bit of money,” said Erin McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group.\n \n\n   \n    In DC, roasters eat some tariffs, but consumers still feel the pinch\n \n\n   \n  Coffee drinkers in the nation’s capital are seeing more expensive drip   and espressos these days. According to data from Toast, a regular hot coffee in Washington, DC, averaged $4.21 in August, up 4% from last year. And the   average price of a cold brew costs $5.35,   up 3.7% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  Swing’s Coffee Roasters, which was founded in 1916 and has three locations in Virginia and Washington, DC,   has been hit with higher-than-usual costs. Owner Mark Warmuth told CNN that Trump’s tariffs caused a “really difficult situation across the board” when combined with environmental and labor factors that make coffee more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are footing the bill for it,” Warmuth said, adding that “the only loser here is the consumer.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of a single cup could go up about 10 or 15 cents, Warmuth warned. Even if importing beans costs 50% more, it’s unlikely a single cup would also increase 50%.\n \n\n   \n  DC coffee drinkers may wince at the price, but they aren’t likely   to give up their caffeine fix.\n \n\n   \n  “(Coffee is) kind of considered an affordable luxury. While it might go from $3 a cup to $3.50 a cup, that may not be enough in downtown DC to cause somebody to change their consumption habits,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Vigilante, owner of Vigilante Coffee Company, which has two locations in California and Maryland, said an average pound of coffee   has gone   up from about $4   to   as much as $6. And a 12-ounce bag of beans could increase by 50 cents to $1 for customers, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vigilante imports much of its coffee from Brazil, and other beans come from countries including Indonesia, Ethiopia and Colombia. Amid  federal layoffs  and other pressures affecting DC residents, he said Vigilante Coffee Company has considered importing coffee from other countries to “diversify our offerings and keep certain price points for our customer base.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite price increases, Vigilante said he’s optimistic that   there are still ways “folks can continue to enjoy great specialty coffee (that) works for their wallet.”\n \n\n   \n  The 50% tariff on top US exporter Brazil, which has seen its coffee bean supply shrink due to a drought, weighs the heaviest on businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Ilg, the owner of Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting in Silver Spring, Maryland, has avoided Brazilian coffee because of the huge tariffs. He doesn’t import coffee himself but buys primarily from third parties and has noticed costs rise in the last eight months.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tariffs “definitely changed things,” Ilg said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, customers now may pay roughly 63 cents more per pound of beans compared to January because of the additional cost of tariffs this year, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The additional costs also put more pressure on small and medium-sized businesses that invest more upfront, said McLaughlin of the Conference Board.\n \n\n   \n  Joel Finkelstein, the owner of Qualia Coffee, which sells at farmers’ markets around DC, said it’s “really hard” to anticipate where his business will be in a year or two because of factors such as uncertainty about pricing.\n \n\n   \n  “Every small business, unless you’re in a very fortunate position, is constantly assessing whether it makes sense to stay open,” Finkelstein said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/nexperia-us-china-car-prices","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"US-China trade dispute over a little-known Dutch chipmaker could halt car production and send prices higher","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nexperia, a Dutch chipmaker, is at the center of a growing US-China trade dispute initiated by U.S. restrictions on its Chinese parent company, Wingtech Technologies, in December 2024.

Dutch chipmaker could halt car production and send prices higher \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Few car buyers have heard of Nexperia. But this Dutch company makes chips that are essential for making cars — and now, it’s at the center of a trade dispute that could shutter global auto plants and send already-record-level car prices even higher.\n \n\n   \n  The dispute is just one part of wider trade tensions between the United States and China. The Nexperia saga began in earnest this past December when the US Commerce Department put Nexperia’s parent company, China-based Wingtech Technologies, on a list of companies facing trade restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Then, this October, China’s Ministry of Commerce banned Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting specific finished components and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia following this move.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions have prompted concerns of possible auto plant shutdowns, since the chips Nexperia makes are critical to the assembly of the cars and trucks in which they’re installed. The fear is that the trade dispute could halt Nexperia’s production of the chips, and it would be difficult to replace them.\n \n\n   \n  When and if auto plants might be forced to halt operations is not clear. But a  similar chip shortage  following the pandemic caused temporary plant shutdowns and the supply of new autos to drop significantly for more than a year. That shortage in turn helped  drive up the price  of both new and used cars.\n \n\n   \n  Vehicles have become more dependent on computer chips, transistors and diodes on everything from adjusting driver’s seats to feeding the proper amount of fuel into engines and providing braking power. Vehicles can’t be completed if those critical components are unavailable.\n \n\n   \n  While Nexperia is little known outside the industry, its site says the company has more than 6,000 products qualified for use in automobiles, and shipments of 110 billion of its products annually. It has 12,500 employees across Europe, Asia and the United States. It said it’s working on business continuity plans and is “confident that a solution will be found.”\n \n\n   \n  But automaker trade groups are less confident and have sounded the alarm  of possible auto plant shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  “If the shipment of automotive chips doesn’t resume – quickly – it’s going to disrupt auto production in the U.S. and many other countries and have a spillover effect in other industries,” John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group for most major automakers, said in a statement. “It’s that significant. We’re urging a quick resolution, so U.S. and global automaking remains on track.”\n \n\n   \n  The European Automobile Manufacturers Association said it would take months to get new supplies of the components its members have been getting from Nexperia, while the supply of its chips is expected to last only weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “Automakers have taken steps over the last years to diversify supply chains but risk cannot be mitigated down to zero. This is a cross-industry issue affecting a large number of suppliers and virtually all of our members,” Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European associations, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We suddenly find ourselves in this alarming situation,” she added. We really need quick and pragmatic solutions from all countries involved.”\n \n\n   \n  Nexperia make about 40% of the automotive chips in the segment of the market that includes transistors and diodes, according to Ian Riches, vice president of the global automotive practice for research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  Automakers are already being forced to deal with increased costs due to tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration. While many are absorbing the costs so far, Kelley Blue Book came out with an estimate last week that the average US new car price just  topped $50,000  for the first time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/cowboys-fashion-politics-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Why are you seeing cowboys everywhere?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The widespread resurgence of cowboy imagery across fashion, media, and politics in 2025 reflects a deep-rooted cultural and political trend.

Today, this image is heavily promoted by conservative political figures like Donald Trump and George W. Bush, and appears in major media like 'Yellowstone' and Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' tour. However, this romanticized portrayal is a mythologized version of reality, ignoring the historical contributions of Mexican, Native, and Black Americans to cowboy culture.

But today’s prevailing cowboy image also highlights how cultural myths are continuously upcycled and resold, regardless of their origins.\n \n\n   \n  Cowboy-inspired fashion graced October’s issue of Vogue, which featured cover stars  Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid on horses  at a Wyoming ranch. Beyoncé’s  “Cowboy Carter” tour  had thousands two-stepping in their country best. The longstanding Western drama “Yellowstone,” its spinoff “1923” and the Billy Bob Thornton-led “Landman” are among some of the  most-watched TV series . And a wide range of brands including  fast-casual restaurant Sweetgreen  and luxury outerwear brand  Canada Goose  have embraced cowboy hats and rusted-red canyon backdrops in ad campaigns.\n \n\n   \n  “This idea of American patriotism ties into this identity,” said Melynda Seaton, art historian at East Texas A&M University. “And I think now, we’re seeing it more.”\n \n\n   \n    Our ideas about cowboys are divorced from reality\n \n\n   \n  Our collective interest in cowboys can be traced to at least the 1880s, when the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows — a theatrical vaudeville traveling performance — brought romantic and entertaining notions of the West and cowboys to the collective popular culture. Since then, those tropes, popularized by Western films, have reappeared in cycles, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  Singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Western actor John Wayne became synonymous with patriotism, further forging the link between cowboys and American identity. That these connections were cemented during McCarthyism and the Red Scare — a time when the American way was perceived to be under threat — is no accident, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  “We started isolating this idea of the cowboy being the epitome of American values,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But pop culture’s depiction of cowboys and the American West is selective.  In ad campaigns, television shows, and even in political discourse, the myth of the cowboy is inherently good, inherently brave, inherently tied to the (American) land. The less glamorous side — the poop shoveled, the low wages — is rarely shown.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things that nobody ever talks about is they only film in the summer for (‘Yellowstone’), because the climate is way too harsh to film in the winter,” Seaton said. “So there’s this weird, only showing the good parts of cowboy culture, but not the bad parts.”\n \n\n   \n  Fashion photographer Richard Avedon exhibited a famous series of portraits from the American West in 1985, having traveled through 17 states and nearly 200 towns  from Texas to Idaho . His portraits poked a hole into the romantic mythology of the American West, telling instead a story of poverty and struggle. A North Dakotan farmer with one arm stares at the camera. A 9-year-old boy in Montana cradles a rifle. A Nebraskan slaughterhouse worker’s white uniform is dyed dark with blood.\n \n\n   \n  The  New York Times  “ripped the exhibition apart,” Seaton said, and many city-dwellers bristled at the harshness of the photos.\n \n\n   \n  Avedon’s portraits are a grim contrast from what we see in old Western films or the fashion and ad campaigns and TV shows of today. The spectacle of the cowboy is so devolved from the actual work of the West, Seaton said, that they exist almost as two separate entities. It is not the actual cowboy that we are interested in; instead, it’s the cowboy costume we have come to mythologize.\n \n\n   \n    Cowboys and the conservative swing\n \n\n   \n  The last time Keegin recalls this level of cowboy costuming was the late 1990s, toward the end of the Clinton administration. “PC culture” was being vilified, she said, and George W. Bush’s Texan twang and plainspoken nature appealed to many.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, there was a pushback against urban-ness and all it has come to represent, Keegin said — liberal values, “elites,” academia, all points still contested today. The cowboy costume’s appeal is in its opposition to that image. As the cowboy image has come to take on these meanings, Republicans’ use of it to gain political favor is  well-documented .\n \n\n   \n  “When we decide that there is ‘real America,’ we tend to buy cowboy hats,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, this rise in cowboy imagery can be attributed in part to the current wave of cultural conservatism, exhibited not just by the Trump administration but by resurging interest in  traditional gender roles  and  conservative social media stars . That resurgence is mirrored in our cultural imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “We are influenced by the politics around us, even if we don’t agree with those politics,” Keegin said. “The aesthetics of those politics influence our choices.”\n \n\n   \n  Arizona native Ben Christensen is a creative director whose work highlights the American West. A recent ad for Zara featured his daughter and her friends dancing in cowboy boots and hats backdropped against the Arizona desert, and he’s brought his signature Western vibe to other campaigns and brands, too. As the cowboy image has become more ubiquitous, Christensen said more companies are capitalizing on its trendiness. Today, the cowboy represents traditional American values, Christensen said: honest, hard working, God-loving and respectful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very old school, but it’s very refreshing,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Politicians toy with those associations in their own cowboy costuming. Trump, who grew a reputation among some as a  “champion of the common man,”  does not explicitly present himself as a cowboy in the way of Bush or Ronald Regan. (The latter specifically wore a cowboy hat in campaign materials despite only playing a cowboy on TV.) Yet, historians have noted that his rhetoric and policies play into the individualist and patriotic characteristics associated with the beloved Western cowboy.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration has taken cowboy individualism now to an extreme, I believe, gutting the US government and centering power in a dominant president, while also pulling the United States out of the web of international organizations that have stabilized the globe since World War II,” said historian Heather Cox Richardson during a public lecture at the University of British Columbia  earlier this year .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s investment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol — the latter of which has reignited its  recruitment presence at rodeos  — can also be seen as a product of this overarching cowboy imagery, which “feeds a conviction that true men dominate situations, both at home and abroad, with violence,”  Richardson wrote . Just as Hollywood cowboys once defended the American frontier, real ones can now do the same at the American border.\n \n\n   \n    A white-washing in real time\n \n\n   \n  The popular image of the cowboy is not one rooted in the actual history of cowboys — who were originally  Mexican, Native  or  enslaved Black Americans  — but rather in myths perpetuated by entertainment. Yet the role people of color have played in the American West is one that has only recently been highlighted and celebrated.\n \n\n   \n  Black horseback riders during the 2020 George Floyd protests ignited a national dialogue around Black urban cowboys that continued through  heavy media coverage  and, later, photography books and  exhibitions . Beyoncé’s 2024 country album “Cowboy Carter” and the ensuing tour was an albeit  imperfect  education in Black rodeo and country culture. And just two months before the release of “Cowboy Carter,” Louis Vuitton creative director Pharrell Williams  showcased dozens of looks  during Paris Fashion Week inspired by the diversity of the American frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Gabriela Hasbun is the photographer behind “The New Black West,” a book of photography that highlights modern Black cowboys and the Black rodeo, showcasing the current, active role Black Americans play in stewarding cowboy culture. Hasbun has covered the Bill Pickett Rodeo in Oakland, California, since 2007, and she remembers the days when the audience in the stands was sparse, primarily locals and rodeo people there to support the community. Fast forward to 2022, she said, and the rodeo was completely sold out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a very hardworking community that puts a lot of effort in making this rodeo happen,” Hasbun said. “They’ve been doing it since 1984, and only until recently have they been applauded.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the images and political messages being pushed in 2025 continue to rely on earlier stereotypes of the Western cowboy. Urban cowboy culture and the diversity of the West has never been more known, yet its visibility has been a blip.\n \n\n   \n  “Yet again, we’re seeing a trend be ushered into the zeitgeist by Black Americans and then whitewashed a few years later,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t concern Kirk Bailey, president of the Oakland Black Cowboy Association, who has seen the interest in cowboys and horseback riding balloon since 2019. The more people learn about cowboy culture and the diversity within it, he said, the more interested they’ll be.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s a trend that’s going to die off anytime soon,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Perpetuated by popular media and politicians alike, the cowboy costume’s current ubiquity is evidence of the image’s grip on the American imagination. While not always a reflection of the true history of real cowboys, its cyclical commercialization is, in its own right, an American tradition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/asia/afghanistan-pakistan-ceasefire-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00-04:00","title":"Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to new ceasefire after more than a week of deadly clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire in Doha, Qatar, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, following over a week of deadly border clashes that began on October 10, 2025.

Kabul in 2021.\n \n\n   \n   Violence between the neighbors  along their disputed, 1,600-mile border broke out on October 10 after Afghanistan first accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes in Kabul and launched retaliatory attacks. Pakistan has long accused Kabul of harboring the Pakistani Taliban militant group (known as the TTP), which its Afghan namesake denies.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the ceasefire agreement, Kabul agreed not to “support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan,” while both sides would “refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” according to a statement from Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The countries had agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire Wednesday, after days of clashes which killed dozens of fighters and civilians on each side.

It accused Pakistani forces of conducting airstrikes on civilian areas in the border province of Paktika.\n \n\n   \n  While Afghanistan “reserves the right to respond to these violations, in order to maintain the dignity and integrity of its negotiating team, its forces have been instructed to refrain from undertaking new military operations at this time,” Mujahid said in a statement at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s information minister said that its security forces had struck “verified” camps of Islamist militants along the border, and rejected that it was targeting Afghan civilians.\n \n\n   \n  “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” Attaullah Tarar said in a  post to X Saturday. \n \n\n   \n  Tarar said the militants had attempted to attack Pakistan during the ceasefire period, but that Pakistan had repelled the attacks, killing more than 100 fighters.

\nUpdated: \n        12:29 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US released the  two survivors  of Thursday’s  military strike  on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia, President Donald Trump said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said it was his “great honor” to destroy a drug-carrying “submarine” with “four known narcoterrorists on board,” two of whom were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” he posted on Truth Social. “Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Perez, 34, was named as the survivor returned to Colombia  in a post on X  from the country’s interior minister Armando Benedetti. Perez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” Benedetti said, adding that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  Benedetti called Perez a “criminal” who “will face justice for drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Ministry of the Interior said Saturday that it received one of the survivors. Authorities told CNN the survivor “is being medically evaluated.” They added that “the corresponding legal process will follow,” but gave no further details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier Saturday that the US was considering releasing the survivors to their home countries. Administration officials were scrambling to determine what to do with the individuals, the first known survivors of the six US military strikes carried out in the Caribbean since September.\n \n\n   \n  The US military detained the survivors after the strike Thursday, marking the first time the Trump administration’s campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s strike was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. It came as the US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it promises further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the prisoners, Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources told CNN the legally dubious situation is why the administration was considering releasing the individuals from US military custody.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n    Petro accuses US of violating territory\n \n\n   \n  Late Saturday night, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro accused the United States of killing a fisherman in a separate, earlier, strike on a vessel.\n \n\n   \n  “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote  in a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing,” he said, adding that the “boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.”\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of Carranza told state-owned TV channel  RTVC Noticias  that he was killed in a US strike on his fishing boat on September 15.\n \n\n   \n  The family said the boat had set off from La Guajira, a peninsula on the northern border with Venezuela, and claimed the boat would not have been out of Colombian waters at the time of the attack, which killed the three people on board, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  “We await explanations from the US government,”  Petro wrote on X .\n \n\n   \n  On September 15, President Trump announced a US strike had  killed  three “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics,”  in a Truth Social post.  He included video showing a boat sitting idle in the water before exploding into flames. It is the only strike the US has publicly acknowledged on that day.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week,  two people briefed by the Pentagon  about the US strikes told CNN that at least one military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months had targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had left from Colombia. The strike the sources identified was on September 19.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona, Max Saltman, Ana María Cañizares, Anabella González and Isabel Tejera contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/middleeast/how-western-sanctions-iran-hurt-middle-class-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00Z","title":"How Western sanctions on Iran have hurt the same middle class that drives reform","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 have severely damaged the country’s middle class, which historically supported political reform, stability, and entrepreneurship.

Gharagozlou, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Iranian middle class, long a force of political moderation, stability, economic growth, and the base of the country’s reform movement, is shrinking fast under the pressure of Western sanctions, researchers say. Left in its wake are rising societal resentments and an ever-increasing wealth gap.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the  European Journal of Political Economy  has used an innovative method to investigate the true extent and damage of Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 and how they have resulted in a dwindling middle class, leaving more Iranians to struggle on low incomes as a small elite prospers.\n \n\n   \n  Resentment between the social classes is clear when speaking with Iranians, and the frustration felt by a young, highly educated population is more palpable than ever. Iran’s current unemployment rate is 7.4% according to the Statistical Center of Iran, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) puts the  rate at 9.2%  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “You can feel the difference between rich and poor more than ever; everything has become expensive, whether it’s bread or chicken. Meanwhile, you see people in luxury coffee shops, luxury restaurants,” said Elham, a schoolteacher in Tehran who is trying to make ends meet. Elham asked to be identified by her first name due to security concerns, as did other Iranians in the country who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The minimum wage in Iran is approximately 104 million rials, about $110 per month. The prices of basic goods have risen, with an annual inflation rate of 42.4%, according to October figures from the IMF. In South Tehran, the price of basic household staples like rice has nearly quadrupled, according to shopkeepers and residents. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, wealthy residents attend exclusive Pilates studios charging 17 million rials.\n \n\n   \n  The recent conflict with Israel highlighted the wealth gap. While the Israeli bombing of Iran’s capital targeted both wealthy and less well-off areas of Tehran, residents with means and access to extra fuel amid a fuel shortage were able to  flee the city  and even the country. One resident, Reza, 36, said: “I couldn’t leave Tehran, even if I wanted to. I couldn’t get fuel to drive anywhere, and I can’t afford the trip to Armenia or Turkey.”\n \n\n   \n  The growing wealth gap and inequality are like a festering wound and Mohammad Reza Farzanegan, a professor of the economics of the Middle East at the University of Marburg in Germany and one of the authors of the new study, told CNN the gap could lead to deep social resentment and damage national unity in the country of around 92 million.\n \n\n   \n  While the Iranian elite continue to reap the benefits of the current system, he said, “the rest of society is left to compete for declining resources in a diminishing economy. The result is a society with increasing inequality and perception of inequality.” The perception of inequality, he added, is even more dangerous to societal stability than the true inequality that exists.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have long been billed by the West as a humane tool in the foreign policy and diplomatic arsenal, often described by proponents as being surgical and precise, targeting governments and leaders with minimal civilian impact. However, by studying Iran, one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world, the researchers have found that not only have sanctions decimated the economy, they have also punished the segment of the Iranian population which has historically pushed for reforms and change, the middle class.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan and his co-author, Nader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University in the United States, used a synthetic control method to create a data-driven, non-sanctioned “twin” of Iran and compare that twin to the real, sanctioned Iran. The results reveal the significant humanitarian, societal, and political impact of this economic tool on the general population.\n \n\n   \n  According to the study, from 2012-2019, when comparing the real Iran and the non-sanctioned “twin,” researchers found that, were it not for sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have expanded by 17%. By 2019, the middle class of the real Iran was 28% smaller than it should have been, according to their modeling. A  separate study  published in the book “How Sanctions Work” looked at household data in Iran and estimated that roughly 9 million people lost middle-class status between 2011 and 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan believes Iran provides a unique case study. Firstly, the scale and intensity of the sanctions imposed on it are unique. While the country has faced sanctions on and off since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when the Western-installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown, paving the way for clerical rule, Iran was hit with the strictest sanctions in modern history in 2012 under the Obama administration. A short respite came after the signing of the nuclear deal known as the JCPOA in 2015, but Iran was once again sanctioned by President Donald Trump in 2018, through his “maximum pressure” policy.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Iran holds a unique position among sanctioned countries due to its demographics, which includes a “large, educated and previously growing middle class,” Farzanegan said. The Western sanctions, he explained, have “attacked the very heart of Iran’s modern social structure.”\n \n\n   \n    Century in the making\n \n\n   \n  The creation of the Iranian middle class – made up of civil servants, teachers and professionals – has been a century in the making, with efforts over the last 45 years focused on lifting poor, marginalized communities through education and opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  From the 1990s, after the Iran-Iraq war of the previous decade, the Iranian middle class saw increased growth through 2012.  Beyond its role in politics, the middle class in Iran has also been a generator of entrepreneurship, giving birth to some of its most successful startups, like Snapp, Iran’s answer to Uber, or Digikala, the Iranian equivalent of Amazon.  But many young Iranians say they see few opportunities now.\n \n\n   \n  “I spend a lot of time wondering if I should leave, thinking about where I should go, and where I can even get a visa. I drive Snapp, and I do courier services at the moment, but it is still a struggle. I’m not sure what else to do with so few jobs,” said Ali, a 34-year-old based in Tehran.\n \n\n   \n  Ali, like many Iranians, has fallen on hard times. Educated as a computer engineer, he has struggled to find work in his field. His concerns have only grown since Israel and the United States carried out strikes in Iran in June, targeting its nuclear program, and as diplomatic efforts between the US and Iran have fizzled, entrenching sanctions further.\n \n\n   \n  The political damage from years of sanctions can already be seen within Iranian society, analysts say. “Sanctions have weakened independent economic actors while strengthening state-linked and security-sector players like the IRGC and bonyads,” said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the US-based Center for International Policy think tank. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is one of the most powerful branches of the Iranian military, also holding political, ideological and economic power, and bonyads are government-backed charitable trusts.\n \n\n   \n  “By channeling resources to actors who benefit from isolation, sanctions have tilted the balance toward factions built on control and confrontation, entrenching hardliner power,” Toossi said.\n \n\n   \n    Changed face of protest\n \n\n   \n  The middle class is historically a force of moderation and stability in Iran, bridging the gaps in society and counteracting extremes.  “The middle classes have the economic security and education to advocate for civil liberties and political accountability,” said Farzanegan. “Our  research  shows that sanctions have systematically taken this security. When people are busy with daily survival, their capacity for organized, long-term political engagement is severely diminished.”\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian middle class has long been the backbone of the reform movement, and the driver of many of Iran’s protest movements over the decades. It has been the base for reformist leaders like President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 and now President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n \n\n   \n  With a reduced middle class, Farzanegan warns that one begins to see a small, elite group profiting off and simultaneously insulated from sanctions at the top, and, at the bottom, what he calls “the new poor” – millions of Iranians pushed down the socio-economic ladder. “Sanctions, combined with corruption, function like Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the middle class and poor to enrich the powerful,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t fully destroy political engagement but changes it. “The political mantle has shifted from a middle-class demand for rights and reforms to a working-class cry for survival and bread,” says Farzanegan.\n \n\n   \n  This shift can be seen in working-class-led protests like the November 2019 fuel protests. While those types of protests are an important force, Farzanegan said, they are “more fragmented and focused on short-term economic grievances, making them both volatile and vulnerable to state repression.”\n \n\n   \n  Another issue is that pushing people into poverty increases their reliance on government services. In Iran, this means relying on IRGC-connected social services that have themselves been hamstrung by sanctions, creating an “unsustainable trap,” Farzanegan said.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have crippled the government’s primary source of revenue, oil exports, limiting the state’s ability to provide for millions of impoverished Iranians through social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Where Iran goes from here is unclear, even as concerns of renewed conflict linger.  Rebuilding a middle class, while possible, is a “generational challenge,” said Farzanegan. “It is not a switch that can be flipped back on, even if all sanctions were lifted tomorrow.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/protestors-voices-no-kings-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00.000Z","title":"Millions Rally Against Trump at 'No Kings' Protests Across the US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, over 7 million Americans participated in nationwide 'No Kings' protests, organized by the Indivisible Project and other decentralized movements, in response to President Donald Trump’s actions perceived as authoritarian, including expanded executive power, immigration raids, and cuts to public programs like Medicaid.

Here’s why protesters say they attended \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To celebrate her 70th birthday, retired government worker Peggy Cole says she and a friend drove nearly 10 hours from her hometown of Flint, Michigan, to join a protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Cole said she felt compelled to mark the milestone at the large demonstration because it’s a “scary time” for Americans and democracy is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  The event was one of more than 2,700 “No Kings” rallies held across the country on Saturday, protesting what organizers describe as President Donald Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda. That’s hundreds more events than were planned for the first go-round in June, when about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest Trump’s administration as he held a  military parade  in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7 million people showed up for Saturday’s rallies – including more than 100,000 people in New York,  organizers  and officials said. Along with larger events in major cities,  small pockets  of “No Kings” protesters cropped up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and at municipal parks in red and blue states alike.\n \n\n   \n  The  largely peaceful protests  followed a tumultuous summer of mass immigration raids, demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities.\n \n\n   \n  Trouble came later in the day when some individuals targeted protesters: A woman in South Carolina was arrested for brandishing a firearm while driving near a demonstration and a man in Georgia was seen on video taking a protester’s flag and pushing another demonstrator to the ground.\n \n\n   \n  While the Trump administration and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is  committed to “nonviolent action”  and had trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation. That became especially important amid  growing political violence  across the country, some organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  Some demonstrators wore yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings,” reads a flyer on  the “No Kings” website .\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters wore costumes, including inflatable chickens, frogs and dinosaurs, which some said emphasized the peaceful nature of the demonstrations. “It’s really hard to call something a war zone, when you look at something and it’s just a block party and people in Halloween costumes,” said a Los Angeles protester who wore a unicorn costume as he danced to music.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters could be heard loudly cheering and chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” They waved American flags along with signs opposing ICE, authoritarianism and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN field teams spoke with attendees at rallies across the country. Here’s what protesters had to say:\n \n\n   \n    ‘We can all save democracy’\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters emphasized the importance of democracy – an institution they fear is eroding with Trump’s attempts to expand executive power.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced,” Joan Press told CNN at a protest in Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  A rally that kicked off the Atlanta protest featured high-profile speakers, including Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.\n \n\n   \n  “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn’t belong to him, our message is very clear,” Warnock later told CNN. “This is not about the people in power, it’s about the power in the people.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly Diemert, an organizer and communications director for the Georgia chapter of 50501, a “decentralized” movement that has helped lead the wave of nationwide protests, reminded the crowd about the city’s civil rights legacy.\n \n\n   \n  “Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement as well as democracy … we don’t want to lose that,” Diemert said.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, one demonstrator held a sign reading: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”\n \n\n   \n  The protester, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, said she’s been protesting since the 1960s, but this time feels different.\n \n\n   \n  “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women’s rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that’s being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”\n \n\n   \n  She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy attended the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don’t want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Our free speech is frightening’\n \n\n   \n  Many demonstrators called out what they feel is a threat to freedom of expression in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t seem like we’re able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, said Bobbie Castillo, who traveled hours from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to DC for her first protest ever.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” rallied the crowd at the DC protest, arguing that Trump and his associates “cannot tolerate dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  “To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts. They tried to silence television hosts,” Nye, a former TV host, said.\n \n\n   \n  Participants in smaller cities and towns said they were struck by the size of the turnout Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  In Ashland, Oregon, Joel Lesko said the day was about “joyfully celebrating our love for America, for free speech, for the importance of community and using our voices for diversity and inclusion and democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  After attending a protest in ruby-red Hendersonville, North Carolina, author Lynn Ames told CNN, “If you love this country, saving democracy is a priority no matter where you live, including in small-town America. Maybe especially in small-town America.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration raids and National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters connected their attendance to the ongoing immigration crackdown and the federal government’s forceful response to anti-ICE protests that first erupted in Los Angeles following local raids. The demonstrations have since spread to numerous other cities, including Chicago, New York City, Dallas and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s attempts to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-controlled cities – which he argues is necessary to quell violence and support his deportation initiatives – have drawn legal challenges by state and local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators in Los Angeles – where federal immigration raids triggered  massive protests  in June and led to Trump sending in the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes – emphasized rights for immigrants and called for a stop to the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in front of LA’s City Hall, Gilberto Beas told CNN the protest is “a message for ICE to stop doing what they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Maria Rivera Cummings, who was born in Los Angeles and is of Mexican descent, said: “We’re all immigrants and everyone has rights here.”\n \n\n   \n  At a demonstration in DC, Michael Langfeldt said he was protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of the military to US cities.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like there’s a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he told CNN. “Congress doesn’t do anything about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Hailey, a 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit, told CNN that she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland, who have faced off against federal law enforcement for weeks. Protesters there have donned  inflatable costumes  at rallies outside an ICE facility — in part to dispute Trump’s characterization of the city as “war-ravaged.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, which has been an  epicenter  for the resistance to Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, many carried Mexican flags and signs like “Hands off our Democracy” and “ICE OUT!”\n \n\n   \n  Actor John Cusack, a Chicago resident known for being outspoken about Hollywood and the US government, said the city’s message to the Trump administration is: “Go to hell!”\n \n\n   \n  “No, you can’t put troops on our streets. You can’t create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power,” the actor said, addressing the president.\n \n\n   \n  Dakota Englert, from Coal City, Illinois, said she came to stand up for basic humanity.\n \n\n   \n  “We all bleed the same color … I feel for the people that are being separated from their families, the people that are being hurt, killed,” Englert said.\n \n\n   \n    Cuts to federal programs\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters expressed concerns about cuts to federal programs — particularly health care.    The protests come as the federal government is shut down, with GOP lawmakers and the White House  locked in a standoff  with Democrats over a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Danielle Guinto, a mother of two, said she worries about the major federal changes to Medicaid and other health-related policies that could impact her children’s health, as well as the rising cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t understand how you can rip food out of people’s mouths, how you can separate, rip people out of their homes,” she told CNN at the Chicago demonstration. “How can you look at a family with fear in their eyes and you’re just going to go take them away?”\n \n\n   \n  Anthony Lee, who works at the Food and Drug Administration and was one of many federal workers who were furloughed following the shutdown, said he came to the demonstration to protect public services. Lee, president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in DC, attended the event with a group of unionized federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a public servant for over 20 years, and to see the destruction, really, of our government, our public services, over the last several months has been really scary,” Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  Another federal government employee who was furloughed said she joined the DC protest because the Trump administration has affected her livelihood and “demonized” federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “The elimination of all these jobs are creating mass threats (for people to be able) to keep their home, to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college and the hope of the American dream,” said Monica, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Nee, a 25-year-old social worker from Maryland, told CNN she’s seeing an impact at the psychiatric hospital she works at in Baltimore.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a lot of people who are coming in and they’re unhoused, a lot of people on Medicaid. Everything’s at risk right now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at the DC protest, Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Trump and his billionaire allies, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is not just about one man’s greed, one man’s corruption or one man’s contempt for the Constitution,” Sanders said. “This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on Earth who, in their insatiable greed, have hijacked our economy and our political system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working families throughout this country.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/marine-corps-anniversary-jd-vance","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-20:30","title":"Vance Celebrates Marine Corps’ 250th Anniversary with California Event That Sparks Back-and-Forth with Newsom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large-scale live artillery demonstration involving fighter jets, helicopters, and naval vessels.

Gavin Newsom over a live artillery demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp Pendleton demonstration, which the Marines called the largest in a decade in the continental US, involved fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom, a Democrat who has  frequently sparred  with the Trump administration, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s office disputed the claim that the demonstration was dangerous. William Martin, Vance’s communications director, said in a statement to CNN that the Marine Corps deemed the demonstration “an established and safe practice” and “part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.”\n \n\n   \n  “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said. “It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Camp Pendleton, Vance — the first Marine to serve as vice president — spoke of his time in the military, saying, “I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance  enlisted in the military  after high school, spending four years in the Marines and serving a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks, he also focused on the Trump administration’s  campaign against  “woke” aspects of the military. “It is not our diversity that makes us stronger,” Vance said. “It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who took the podium before Vance, made a similar argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I look out at this crowd, I see a lot of different types of faces. The truth is your diversity is not your strength. Never has been,” Hegseth said. “Your strength is in your unity of purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Pentagon has cracked down on diversity initiatives and rolled back efforts made over the last decade attempting to eradicate toxic culture in the military.\n \n\n   \n  During Saturday’s celebration, Vance also delivered a message from the president, acknowledging the  weekslong government shutdown  but placing blame on Democrats — particularly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n \n\n   \n  “I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J. Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he’s proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, as thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or are working without pay, the Department of Defense is  continuing to pay troops  by using “unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/how-qatar-became-trumps-key-ally-in-his-middle-east-peace-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00+00:00","title":"How Qatar Became Trump’s Key Ally in His Middle East Peace Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During President Donald Trump’s first and second terms, Qatar transitioned from being the subject of sharp criticism during a regional blockade to becoming a central pillar of U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. Initially criticized in 2017 for allegedly funding terrorism, Trump’s views shifted as he developed personal rapport with Qatari leaders, especially Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. This relationship deepened through business ties, diplomatic engagement, and proven effectiveness in mediating critical negotiations—such as the Taliban peace agreement in Afghanistan and the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. Qatar played a pivotal role in facilitating private talks between U.S. envoys and Hamas leaders, directly contributing to the agreement. Despite controversies, including the U.S. failure to notify Qatar before an Israeli strike on Hamas in Doha, Trump strengthened the alliance through a bilateral defense pact and by securing an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.

Qatar became Trump’s key ally in his Middle East peace efforts \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he flew to the Middle East to celebrate his diplomatic victory on a  ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza,  President Donald Trump heaped praise on one ally in particular: Qatar.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar was a tremendous help to getting this done. I hope people can realize that,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “It was very tough and very dangerous for Qatar. They were very brave.”\n \n\n   \n  The Gulf nation has long been a broker in diplomatic negotiations but its key role as mediator, along with Egypt, in the Gaza talks further cemented its stature in the eyes of the US president.\n \n\n   \n  In a sign of the warm relationship within his first 10 months in office, Trump  received a plane  meant to be used as Air Force One from Doha and the president signed an executive order giving Qatar an unprecedented bilateral defense pact with the US following an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in its capital Doha.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s effusive praise was a far cry from his stance on Qatar in the early months of his first term, when he accused the nation of funding terrorism in the region.\n \n\n   \n  US officials, regional sources, and experts say the vastly improved relations are due to the development of personal relations between Trump and members of his close inner circle and Qatari leaders, a steady campaign of lobbying, and the nation’s ability to deliver as an effective interlocutor between the US and a vast number of players including the Taliban, the Houthis, Iran and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t recall any country that’s had the turnaround that Qatar has,” said Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The Qataris were critical’\n \n\n   \n  Trump signaled the importance of his relationship with Qatar to his second term by including the small nation on the first overseas trip after his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump immediately tapped into the relationships that had developed during his first term and had been strengthened by business deals that his friends and family had done with Qatar in recent years, explained current US officials and regional diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president’s first term in office, a  CNN tally of the deals  found in May. Earlier this year, the Trump Organization announced plans for a Trump-branded golf resort in Qatar that was supported by a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  The Qatari Emir also maintained direct contact with Trump during his years out of office, which is something not all other world leaders did, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  The familiarity made for productive, trustworthy and blunt interactions, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman noted that Trump “wants to be seen as this great dealmaker” and win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Qatar is seen as being able to “help him get done on the international stage what he wants to get done.”\n \n\n   \n  Qatar helped to draft the 21-point plan for peace in Gaza that Witkoff initially shared with Arab and Muslin nations in New York, which led to pivotal discussions that laid the groundwork for the hostage release and ceasefire which came just weeks later, a source said.\n \n\n   \n  And then, when last week’s high-stakes negotiations occurred in Egypt, Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner met privately with Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya and a senior Qatari official, a meeting which led to a breakthrough in negotiations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It came as Hamas was looking for reassurances that Israelis would not reignite the war after the Israeli hostages held by the group were released.\n \n\n   \n  The Qataris sought out Witkoff and Kushner for the meeting, first reported by Axios, which was pivotal in securing the agreement to release hostages and put a ceasefire into effect later that night.\n \n\n   \n  “Plain and simple, that agreement would not have been accomplished without the Qataris,” said an administration official. “The Qataris were critical in facilitating discussions with Hamas that were crucial in securing a final agreement in Egypt.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke highly of the Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani when they signed an agreement aimed at regional peace alongside other regional leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “His Highness Sheikh Tamim is respected by everybody. He’s respected by everybody, and in the most positive way. Not only because of power, because of his heart. He’s got a tremendous heart and he’s a great leader, and his country loves him,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Qatar remains a controversial topic within Trump’s orbit, with some key allies of the president voicing deep concerns about the country’s growing influence.\n \n\n   \n  Among the loudest critics of Qatar is far-right activist Laura Loomer, an influential figure within the administration who slammed the announcement Qatar would be allowed to build an Air Force training facility in Idaho last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Republican allies in Congress have also been left in the dark, at times, about Qatar’s dealings with the administration, even on matters that directly impact the states they represent.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s entire GOP-led congressional delegation, which includes chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, and its Republican Governor, only learned that the administration had formally agreed the Air Force training deal when it was announced publicly by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar’s relationship with the Trump administration was also tested earlier this year when the US did not notify them before Israel carried out a military strike against Hamas leaders in Doha. US officials scrambled to contain the potential fallout from the strike by reassuring Qatar it, too, was left in the dark by the Israelis, despite evidence top administration officials were told before bombs were dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Trump pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar — which he did via phone from the Oval Office during a recent trip to the White House. Sources familiar with the incident told CNN that the administration’s failure to notify Qatar ahead of time, given its central role in negotiations, initially raised serious questions about US credibility at the time. But when Trump forced Netanyahu’s apology, the “answer came back very firmly” that the US was serious about maintaining the US-Qatar alliance, according to a regional source said.\n \n\n   \n  “You saw the picture, Netanyahu reading from a paper. The picture talks more than the pen,” the regional source said, noting the executive order bolstering the alliance between the US and Qatar.\n \n\n   \n    Qatar delivering on Taliban talks crucial to first term shift\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Trump and Qatar started on tense footing during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar’s influence in the US in 2016 was nominal at best,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2017, at the beginning of a diplomatic crisis sparked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cutting diplomatic ties and imposing a blockade on Qatar, Trump lambasted Doha.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a decision to make,” Trump said, describing conversations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. “Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive remarks perplexed even his then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who asked aides following the speech how the comments had ended up in the president’s speech, according to a source familiar with the interaction.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson and top military officials then made it a priority in the following months to brief Trump on the strong US-Qatar relationship on both military and diplomatic fronts, particularly providing details about Qatar being home to Al-Udied which is the largest US military base in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson, a former Exxon executive, also had particularly close relations with Qataris after having done energy deals with the Gulf nation.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, according to Freedman, Doha “sought to flip the script really quick and went on a lobbying and PR firm hiring blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  “They started hiring Republican heavyweights from (former Attorney General) John Ashcroft’s firm, several other firms, Ballard, that were very close to the President,” Freeman explained. Attorney General Pam Bondi was a registered lobbyist for Qatar during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  But over time the blockade made Trump more receptive to Qatar, a former administration official said. The Gulf nations claimed the blockade was an effort to apply economic pressure on Qatar as a result of its alleged support for terrorism, but as it continued Trump worried it was stifling progress and economic ties in the region, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also irritated at the other regional players for putting the blockade into place without giving the US advance notice – a move they took just weeks after Trump had visited Saudi Arabia, which was the first overseas trip of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump gives people under attack the benefit if the doubt, he also felt blindsided by the move which he did not like,” said a former Trump administration official.\n \n\n   \n  Less than a year after his inflammatory White House remarks, in April 2018, Trump hosted the Qatari Emir at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  When the Emir visited Washington for a second time in 2019, administration officials noticed that the two developed a good personal rapport, multiple sources said. Trump went to a Treasury Department dinner with the Emir which he had not been scheduled to attend – reflecting a real warming in relations, sources said. At that time, Doha was hosting talks between the US and the Taliban as Trump pushed for an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Things were fine, but they had not gone from opponents to friends,” said John Bolton, Trumps’ national security adviser at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, Bolton recalled, after the signing of the Doha agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government which set into motion the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump’s top Taliban negotiator, Zalmay Khalilizad, spent copious amounts of time with the Taliban in Doha, meetings that paved the way for the agreement to be signed.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really the point where they moved, started moving towards the relationship they have now,” Bolton said. “The American president had asked them to do something and they were doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself has chalked up the difference to having not really known the country in 2017 when he first became president.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t really know them very well,” Trump told reports of his initial take on the small but rich nation in 2017. “As I got to know them, I got to understand them, and I got to realize that they’re in the middle of they are right in the middle of everything. Other countries are there, but they’re an hour and an hour-and-a-half away. A big difference.”\n \n\n   \n    Qatar has come through for Trump where others failed\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s second term there have been multiple instances where the administration has gone back to Qatar when other intermediaries have not delivered.\n \n\n   \n  During Gaza talks earlier this year, the administration at one point tried a new tact putting a Palestinian-American who was not a government official in charge of the talks with Hamas to try and drive a Gaza ceasefire. But when that approach failed to produce results, they shifted back to Qatar as the critical interlocutor with the group.\n \n\n   \n  A similar situation unfolded when it came to efforts to draw Iran into a new nuclear deal. The Trump administration initially relied on Oman to facilitate months of indirect talks with Iran led by Witkoff, but when those talks fell apart the administration turned back to Qatar to engage in dialogue with Iran. Ultimately the deal never manifested, and Trump carried out strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But the importance of Qatar as a trusted go-between had been cemented once again.\n \n\n   \n  Now, advancing the Gaza agreement to the next phase which would include de-militarizing Hamas is set to further test Qatar’s ability to serve as a back-channel with Hamas. White House Spokesperson Anna Kelly said that the Qataris are “invested in ensuring that the deal is implemented.”\n \n\n   \n  But the breadth of efforts that the US and Qatar are working on are also widespread. Dr. Majed Al Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited the wide range of issues the country is working on with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working right now with the administration on DRC-Rwanda, working with them on Venezuela, working with them on Colombia, working with them on the myriad of issues, some of them I can’t mention right now, all related to peace facilitation,” he said at the Concordia Summit event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in late September.\n \n\n   \n  “That appreciation of the relationship in Qatar does not go unnoticed,” Al Ansari continued.\n \n\n   \n  “This goes beyond any individual, but working with President Trump, working with this administration very closely, is something that has brought a lot of results,” he said. “It’s a relationship that is beneficial for the region as a whole and for the world.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-body-from-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:27:00-04:00","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Tenth Hostage as Delicate Truce Enters Second Week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement.

Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Israel  believes  that Hamas does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter, and Israel’s Foreign Minister has accused Hamas of trying to use them as bargaining chips.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, has previously called for help, saying on Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages.\n \n\n   \n  In that statement, al-Qassam Brigades said it has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n    Ceasefire holds despite killings\n \n\n   \n  For the moment, both sides appear to believe the ceasefire in Gaza is holding though not without coming under strain from the failure of Hamas to return all the bodies, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and continued, if isolated, incidents of killings of Palestinians in Israeli strikes.\n \n\n   \n  A Palestinian family travelling back to their home in the north of the Gaza were killed by the Israeli military on Friday after their vehicle crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle was carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, Basal said. After coordinating with the United Nations, Gaza’s civil defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the civil defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire with such killings, but no retaliatory action was taken as of Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has also allowed more aid to enter in recent days but aid groups are calling for the opening of more crossings to improve deliveries.\n \n\n   \n  The World Food Programme said on Friday that it has not been able to bring enough food into Gaza because conditions are “extremely difficult”, including communities being on the move, the parlous road conditions, and the fact only two border crossings are open.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafah border crossing, a key gateway that connects Gaza to Egypt, has yet to open.\n \n\n   \n  The crossing was set to open to civilian traffic in both directions as part of the ceasefire agreement, but Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said on Thursday that the date of the opening “will be announced at a later stage.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s Foreign Minister said last week it could open on Sunday. But on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said it would remain closed until further notice, adding that the crossing’s opening would be subject to Hamas meeting the terms of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Its opening will be considered depending on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline,” a statement from his office said.\n \n\n   \n    Phase Two\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations on the crucial next stages of the ceasefire deal began in Egypt last week, an Israeli source and a regional official told CNN, with the talks focusing on the demilitarization of Gaza, governance of the strip and the formation of an international force to help secure the enclave after two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  A 20-point plan presented by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza states that the enclave will be administered by a non-political technocratic group of Palestinians and an overseeing body called the ‘Board of Peace’ - set to be chaired by United States President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  An International Stabilization Force (ISF) made up of troops from several countries will be constructed to secure the strip, according to the plan.\n \n\n   \n  But even though Hamas dispatched its chief negotiator to Cairo for discussions over the Palestinian committee set to govern Gaza, the militant group remains vague over its disarmament and transfer of power.\n \n\n   \n  And countries set to join the International Stabilization Force are still negotiating its structure, with some asking for a mandate from the UN Security Council before joining.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Izso contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/entertainment/israel-palestine-boycott-javier-bardem","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"There’s a ceasefire — but Hollywood’s fight over Israel and Gaza still rages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a ceasefire being reached between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities taking starkly opposing positions.

Gaza still rages \n       \n  By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Over the last two years, many big-name celebrities have made noise on behalf of a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Now that a ceasefire —  no matter how fragile it may be  — has been reached, the tensions in Hollywood show no signs of ending. In this heated environment, even what you post online, and when you post it, is fodder.\n \n\n   \n  Erin Foster, creator of Netflix’s hit series “Nobody Wants This,” went on Instagram this week to ask: “I’m not sure why everyone is being so utterly quiet today, but there is a deal in place that will finally bring peace to Palestinians. Why are you not celebrating it?”\n \n\n   \n  “After 2 years of screaming ‘Ceasefire Now!!’ It is clear that was never the issue. It was eradicating Israel,” actress Debra Messing wrote on her Instagram this week. (Messing is one of Hollywood’s most vocal pro-Israel voices.) “The silence of the ‘Free Palestine’ movement is sickening,” she re-posted. “Your silence makes it unavoidably obvious that it’s only about terrorizing Jews.”\n \n\n   \n  Pro-Palestinian and anti-war celebrities have used red carpets, award shows and their social media accounts to keep focus on the people of Palestine. Mark Ruffalo, for one, reposted a message this week from Film Workers for Palestine that said, “We share in the relief of Palestinians in Gaza that Israel’s relentless slaughter may be coming to an end.” A week ago, he also reposted a note from the group Artists4Ceasefire that expressed hope about the ceasefire and for the return of hostages to Israel. He was among those criticized for not marking the return of the Israeli hostages since they were released earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Cynthia Nixon, similarly, had posted a message to “Free all the hostages and Free Palestine” on October 9, but pro-Israel activists said that she didn’t acknowledge the return of Israeli civilian hostages. These activists also suggested that none of these celebrities spoke up about Hamas executing Palestinians in the streets of Gaza this week.\n \n\n   \n  The execution-style killings of Palestinians in Gaza has a potential to trigger an unraveling of the ceasefire. President Donald  Trump warned  Hamas this week that “We will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” in  an escalation of rhetoric  during this brittle moment.\n \n\n   \n  “Celebrities that have been so outspoken and so engaged with this conflict and calling out Israel almost on a daily basis have all gone quiet about the brutal murder of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire began,” says Hen Mazzig, senior fellow at the pro-Israel Tel Aviv institute, which utilizes influencers online to enact opinion change about both Jews and Israel. He made the claim that these activists didn’t care about Palestinians but were only using the cause to attack Israel, saying that “the mask was off”: “We know exactly what they stand for and we know exactly what it was all about — I think it’s clear it was about using their platform to attack Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Bardem — who has been one of Hollywood’s biggest critics of Israel and most passionate advocates for Palestinians — spoke to CNN about the executions specifically.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, I am completely against the execution of anyone including Palestinians by Hamas. It is an atrocious act of violence,” Bardem said in a statement, speaking on the matter for the first time. “Everyone deserves a fair trial where the accusations are shown and proven, and only then be rightfully accountable by a fair law that obviously does not include execution.”\n \n\n   \n    The boycott that will pit studios and talent against each other\n \n\n   \n  Bardem is one of nearly 4,000 Hollywood figures who signed a pledge last month to boycott Israeli film institutions. The pledge said that Israel’s filmmaking industry is “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  On the Emmys red carpet last month, Bardem wore a keffiyeh and did a series of interviews to support the people of Palestine, telling   Variety , “I cannot work with somebody that justifies or supports the genocide. That’s as simple as that. And we shouldn’t be able to do that, in this industry or any other industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli film boycott, organized last month by Film Workers for Palestine, drew support from a substantial number of A-listers, including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Ayo Edebiri, Ilana Glazer, Susan Sarandon, Ruffalo, Nixon and Bardem.  (A representative for Nixon did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Ruffalo’s representative said he was unavailable and in production overseas.)\n \n\n   \n  The boycott prompted an open letter from a different group of Hollywood artists, including Liev Schreiber, Gene Simmons, Sharon Osbourne, Jerry O’Connell, Howie Mandel, Mayim Bialik and Messing who denounced the call to stop working with Israeli film institutions over the war in Gaza, stating that the letter promotes “censorship and the erasure of art.”\n \n\n   \n  Paramount and Warner Bros. – which are both under the leadership of pro-Israel CEOs in David Ellison and David Zaslav, respectively – have issued statements taking a clear stand against the Israel film boycott, in a strong and rare public position from two major Hollywood studios. (Warner Bros. shares the same parent company as CNN.)\n \n\n   \n  Now, they will have to contend with thousands of artists in the creative community who disagree with their company’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  Bardem told CNN that the Film Workers for Palestine pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions is about holding institutions accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “I want this to be very clear. We do not discriminate against any person based on their nationality, race, religion, or gender,” Bardem told CNN. “We of course believe discrimination of any kind is wrong and do not support that and have continued to reiterate this. We support holding companies and institutions all over the world accountable, not individuals, for their complicity and participation in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the illegal settlement of the West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  A representative for Artists4Ceasefire – which was the first advocacy group to galvanize prominent celebrities to call for a ceasefire after October 7, 2023 – declined to participate in an interview with CNN about next steps for the movement now that a ceasefire deal has been reached, but provided a statement about their mission of achieving a permanent ceasefire. (The representative also declined to identify who runs the organization, saying that “we are a collective of artists and advocates.”)\n \n\n   \n  That group is behind the red pins that many celebrities – from Ruffalo to comedian Ramy Youssef to singer Billie Eilish – wore on the Oscars red carpet, symbolizing solidarity with Palestinian people. Roughly 500 celebrities and Hollywood artists signed the Artists4Ceasefire petition in 2023; dozens of industry A-listers signed an  Artists4Ceasefire letter  addressed to then-President Biden, urging the White House for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Our call remains the same as it has been since October 2023: a permanent ceasefire, a return of all hostages, and the immediate, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza,” said the Artists4Ceasefire representative in a statement. “This is the beginning of what is required for healing, rebuilding and a just and lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches to see if a ceasefire will hold and bring peace, Hollywood, usually more unified on social justice issues, will continue to wrestle both in public and in private.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a ceasefire, but I would say that it is far from resolved,” said Tatiana Siegel, executive editor of film and media at Variety. “I’ve talked to a lot of studio executives who tell me that they are very aware of who signed what and are not eager to work with people that they strongly disagree with. This was a situation where everyone in Hollywood became a Middle Eastern expert overnight and was chiming in with their opinions one way or another on social media.”\n \n\n   \n  Already over the past two years, stars have been dropped from agencies and fired from franchises over this conflict. “A lot of people feel angry about what they saw,” said Siegel. “Where do we go from here?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/ukraine-russia-advances-aerial-bombardment-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00-04:00","title":"Russian Forces, Aided by Heavy Aerial Bombardments, Edge Forward in Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a call from US President Donald Trump for a combat freeze, Russian forces are advancing in multiple areas of Ukraine, including Kupiansk and near Vovchansk and Pokrovsk.

by heavy aerial bombardments, edge forward in Ukraine \n       \n  By Tim Lister and Svitlana Vlasova\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:23 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a  combat freeze  along existing lines.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC.\n \n\n   \n  But the Russians seem intent on locking in gains before the onset of winter. On Friday, they used a record 268 guided aerial bombs, according to the Ukrainian military, compared to an average of 170 to 180 per day in recent weeks. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians have also continued  nightly barrages  of drones and missiles against targets across Ukraine, especially against energy infrastructure. In September, an average of more than 180 drones were launched every night, more than twice the number at the beginning of the year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% are not being intercepted.\n \n\n   \n  To some analysts, the Kremlin has no incentive to compromise.\n \n\n   \n  “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot  in Foreign Affairs .\n \n\n   \n  “It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds.\n \n\n   \n  One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. About 80 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, the Ukrainian military acknowledged on Thursday, and its defenders were “doing everything possible to clear Kupiansk of Russian invaders and prevent the accumulation of enemy infantry in the city.”\n \n\n   \n  One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.”\n \n\n   \n  Also in Kharkiv region, closer to the international border, the Russians have claimed advances near the town of Vovchansk, including the capture of a nearby village.\n \n\n   \n  In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. For its part, the Ukrainian military has claimed to have recovered some 70 square miles of territory in the Pokrovsk area over the past two months, in a series of counterattacks.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, insisted Friday that the Russians did not have “the strategic initiative. At the cost of enormous losses, the adversary has achieved only minor advances in certain sections of the front.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy’s spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.\n \n\n   \n  And Russian advances come at great cost. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an  estimate  in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine’s military command. CNN cannot verify battlefield figures.\n \n\n   \n  In the face of these losses, the Russian defense ministry appears to be changing the way it recruits additional personnel. In recent weeks, Russian regions have begun paring back the generous sign-on bonuses used to attract recruits.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has traditionally relied on financial incentives to attract volunteers and avoid another mobilization, but the practice “is likely hitting diminishing returns, which may compel the Kremlin to adopt an alternative approach,” according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia may begin to mobilize members of Russia’s active reserve on a rolling basis to sustain its combat operations in Ukraine,” according to ISW.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Ukraine is betting on long-range strikes targeting Russian energy infrastructure to persuade the Kremlin to accept negotiations. It has stepped up production of its own cruise missiles, although it has been unable as yet to persuade Trump to  supply Tomahawk missiles .\n \n\n   \n  Since the beginning of the year, successful strikes haved been carried out against 45 facilities in Russia’s fuel and energy sector, according to Syrskyi. Industry analysts estimate that one-fifth of Russia’s refining capacity has been disrupted.\n \n\n   \n  But despite the casualties and damage to Russia’s economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of agreeing to a ceasefire or negotiations with Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,300 days since the full-scale Russian invasion began, as one  expert  puts it, “Ukraine cannot destroy Russia’s war capacity, while Russia appears unable to militarily defeat Ukraine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:57:00.000-04:00","title":"Six Universities Reject White House Funding Deal with Attached Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Six universities, including the University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, and MIT, have rejected a White House funding proposal that would offer preferential access to federal grants in exchange for significant ideological and policy changes.

Universities argue that such demands compromise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and merit-based research competition. The White House cast the initiative as a way to improve higher education through ideological alignment, but critics, including university leaders and advocates for academic independence, view it as an overreach that undermines the sovereignty of academic institutions.

Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:57 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  After a meeting at the White House Friday, the University of Virginia declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of five schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  USC, Penn, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an unprecedented level of control over universities – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, six have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n   Vanderbilt University  and the University of Arizona have said they are reviewing the compact, with Arizona’s president saying the “proposal has generated a wide range of reactions and perspectives.” Neither of the schools have indicated if they are planning to sign on or not.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/soccer-premier-league-ange-postecoglou-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"10:58:00-04:00","title":"Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou fired after just 39 days at Premier League club","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ange Postecoglou, the Australian football manager appointed by Nottingham Forest in late 2025, was dismissed after just 39 days in charge following a poor run of results, including a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea.

The announcement on Friday evening draws a line once and for all, without having to go through the messy machinations of a parliamentary intervention, which would have been required to remove the dukedom.\n \n\n   \n  The relinquishment of such a title within the British royal family is incredibly rare.\n \n\n   \n  The last instance is understood to be over 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward, who was one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons, had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for fighting for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, during World War I.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew still retains the title “prince,” bestowed on him at birth as the son of the then reigning monarch. But he is giving up all other titles conferred on him in honor by the royal family. For a man who clearly relishes his status, this is no small loss.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew stepped down from public life in 2019 following a disastrous BBC interview in which he was questioned about his friendship with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, in 2022, he  stopped  using the style His Royal Highness, or HRH, and was stripped of his military titles and charity patronages.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the fallout from his association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial in the United States on federal charges of sexually abusing underage girls, has continued to plague him.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s decision is thought to be Andrew’s own, and was made in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continue to be a distraction from the wider work of the royal family, his statement Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  While it appears to have been his choice, he – and the rest of the Windsor clan – were facing mounting pressure to resolve the situation. CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams said Andrew had become “toxic to the royal brand.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a signal that… we will not see him in family events, we are not going to see him when there’s a big celebration for King Charles’s 80th birthday in a couple of years; Andrew is out of the fold,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, is this enough to stop the backlash overall tainting the royal family?”\n \n\n   \n  Williams believes a question mark now hangs over Andrew’s continued residence in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor, although he has a private tenancy agreement for the property with the Crown Estate which has not been affected by the change in use of titles and honors, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  The thorny issue of what do with Andrew has loomed over the King since he ascended to the throne in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Charles’ dilemma was one perhaps unique to royals. Andrew is both his brother and a senior member of an ancient institution.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has largely stayed out of the limelight since 2019 and has only generally attended private family events – one of the most recent being the  Duchess of Kent ’s funeral service, at which he was accompanied by Sarah Ferguson.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, this step-back from public life has done little to stop the headlines.\n \n\n   \n  His links to Epstein have remained in the spotlight, with the prince facing fresh backlash during the 2021 sex trafficking trial of disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, when one of her accusers named Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, multiple British news outlets reported on an email which appeared to raise questions over Andrew’s stated timeline regarding when he cut off contact with Epstein. Similarly, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who will now no longer use the title Duchess of York, has faced backlash in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Files from Epstein’s estate continue to be released by the US House Oversight Committee and there has been media speculation as to whether Andrew’s name will feature in those.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had previously alleged that she had been forced to have sex with the prince after being trafficked by Epstein, is due to be published in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had repeatedly denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault. She died by suicide in April at age 41.\n \n\n   \n  The book’s release comes in the same week that King Charles and Queen Camilla are headed to the Vatican for a historic state visit.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein aside, Andrew has also faced questions over his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy, named by a British court in December as Yang Tengbo. Yang is alleged to have worked for China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a branch of the ruling Communist Party tasked with gaining influence both at home and overseas. A court hearing described Yang as having developed an “unusual degree of trust” with the younger brother of King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  In April this year, a 10-page document on Andrew’s relations with Yang was  released  by British courts.\n \n\n   \n  It seems the palace realized that the institution’s reputation was continuing to be impacted by the disgraced prince despite the previous moves to remove him as a working royal, which may be why further internal discussions took place, leading to Friday’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  There will be those – including monarchy-abolishment campaign group Republic who described the move as “too little, too late” – who say palace should have acted sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts  told CNN  that “this is what my sister was fighting for for so many years,” following the news that Andrew had given up using his remaining titles.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a day where we’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears. Happy because it’s a good start,” he said. “Her kids get to know their mom as somebody that really did something in this world, that she actually spread a lot of good and was able to hold people to account.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/george-santos-sentence-commuted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:44:00-04:00","title":"Former Rep.

George Santos released from prison after Trump commutes his sentence \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Kaanita Iyer, Fadel Allassan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:44 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgraced former Rep. George Santos,  who had been serving a seven-year term  for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, was released from prison on Friday night after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence, his lawyer tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump first announced the commutation on Truth Social on Friday evening, and, according to attorney Joseph Murray, Santos’ family picked him up from the prison about five hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” the president wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s commutation comes just months after Santos, 37, surrendered on July 25 to serve  87 months in prison .\n \n\n   \n   Before he surrendered, Santos told Saudi outlet Al Arabiya English that he asked Trump for a pardon but believed he “got stonewalled.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it made it to the president,” Santos said of his pardon request at the time. “Unfortunately, gatekeepers have blockaded for it to ever get to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  But even from behind bars, Santos continued to make his case.  According to his verified X page , he wrote an open letter to Trump earlier this week, pleading for “fairness” while also saying he takes “full responsibility” for his actions.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness — for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires,” Santos wrote in  the letter published in The South Shore Press. \n \n\n   \n  The law firm that represented Santos celebrated the president’s move, telling CNN, “We applaud the President for correcting this injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  Murray  posted on X  a message on behalf of Santos thanking GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -who he said “fought like a lion” for him – as well as  Lauren Boebert , Anna Paulina Luna, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom he described as “in regular contact.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos also expressed gratitude to “the greatest DOJ team ever assembled”, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Associated Deputy AG Diego Pestana, and US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, among other. Martin  wrote on X  he was “honored” to have played “a small role” in Trump granting “clemency” to Santos, and thanked the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the commutation drew mixed reaction from lawmakers. Taylor Greene — who wrote a letter to Trump in August asking him to commute Santos’ sentence — also thanked the president in a  post on X , adding that Santos “was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, slammed Trump for focusing on Santos instead of Americans’ health care — an issue at the center of the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has time to free serial fraudster George Santos from prison. But he can’t be bothered to address the Republican healthcare crisis crushing working class Americans,” Jeffries said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the former congressman pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges stemming from activity during his 2022 midterm campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I deeply regret my conduct,” Santos said in court at that time. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023, before completing a full term in the US House – becoming only the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  During his short time in Congress, reports emerged of Santos having fabricated parts of his biography, including his employment history and education. He  eventually admitted to  doing that.\n \n\n   \n  Santos represented parts of Long Island and Queens and attempted to run in another New York district before pleading guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Santos had been serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, per the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-power-iaea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Work underway to restore power at Ukrainian nuclear plant as UN announces rare local ‘ceasefire zones’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been without off-site power for four weeks—the longest outage since the war began—forcing emergency diesel generator use.

members of a family in Phoenix in 1993 \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona’s  second execution of the year .\n \n\n   \n  Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\n \n\n   \n  His execution was the  fourth in the country this week  and the 39th of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\n \n\n   \n  Djerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  No representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\n \n\n   \n  It took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  Barcello said Djerf’s veins “were not optimal” and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n \n\n   \n  “By all accounts the process went according to plan and without any incident,” Barcello said. A month ago, Djerf  released a statement  in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\n \n\n   \n  The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\n \n\n   \n  There was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with  15 doses  of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\n \n\n   \n  Executions resumed in 2022, and  three prisoners were put to death  that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\n \n\n   \n  The review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona last carried out a death sentence in mid-March,  executing Aaron Brian Gunches  for the 2002 killing of Ted Price.\n \n\n   \n  With Djerf’s execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.\n \n\n   \n  Five more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/business/steinway-piano-factory-trump-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"How a company from the Gilded Age could be the future of US manufacturing","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in Queens, New York, remains a rare success story in American manufacturing by relying on skilled craftsmanship and domestic production rather than mass manufacturing.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Oversized crowbars bend wood for a piano’s rim. Circular sanders smooth rough edges on costly Sitka spruce soundboards. Hammers and chisels notch a bridge to allow piano strings to vibrate freely.\n \n\n   \n  For 30 years, Bernard Craddock has been one of the roughly 200 workers handcrafting pianos at the 150-year-old Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, a neighborhood in the New York borough of ﻿Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody has a specific job here,” Craddock said, working on a piano frame. “My job is to set this straight for the hammers to hit the strings.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has vowed to start an American manufacturing renaissance, one of the main aims of his trade war. But manufacturing isn’t easy anywhere in the United States thanks to high costs, strict regulations and lack of workers with the necessary skills.\n \n\n   \n  Steinway & Sons, however, is a rare bright spot in US manufacturing. A company that thrives because it doesn’t mass produce its product. Instead, it uses a small workforce of skilled craftsmen to produce a premium item — world-class pianos.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this storied, legacy brand,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They can charge a premium for that, but they also are serving higher market segments that can afford to pay those premium prices and need to because they’re performing on pianos at the highest levels.”\n \n\n   \n  Most US manufacturers are forced to compete on price, which has become tougher as Trump’s tariffs, especially on key inputs like steel, aluminum and copper, have raised prices.\n \n\n   \n  But by making pianos many consider the best in the world, Steinway can charge high enough prices to keep its US-based operation up and running. A Steinway grand piano can be priced as low as $90,000 or as much as $200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are the largest manufacturer remaining in New York City, we’re very proud of that. It’s not easy to continue to manufacture in New York,” Steinway & Sons CEO Ben Steiner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steiner said his company thrives because it focuses on quality merchandise.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no other way with the cost structure that we have to operate in New York City, or even operating in the United States or in Europe,” he added. “Unless you’re focused on quality and innovation, you’re not going to survive.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s trade agenda could affect jobs\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stated goal of reshoring manufacturing jobs, Trump’s tariffs on most US imports may be  having the opposite effect .\n \n\n   \n  The US shed another  12,000 manufacutring jobs in August , the latest data available, for the fourth month in a row. Roughly 42,000 jobs have been lost since April.\n \n\n   \n  Hersh said Trump’s chaotic trade agenda is acting as a roadblock to factory hiring.\n \n\n   \n  “Businesses don’t like (tariffs), but they can adjust to a reasonable tariff,” Hersh said. “(Trump has) created uncertainty for the economy that just has businesses sitting on their hands, not being able to make decisions about investment or to hire new workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House told CNN that the goal of Trump’s policy is to ensure domestic manufacturers are able to source everything they need in the US, from inputs to workers.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot just be an assembler of foreign-made parts. The Trump administration is taking a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshore every step of the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “There is no shortage of American hands and minds to build America’s next industrial Golden Age.”\n \n\n   \n  But American manufacturing looks very different from five decades ago, when millions of workers were employed to perform specific tasks along assembly lines. After trade agreements flourished in the 1990s, many of those jobs moved abroad.\n \n\n   \n  And in today’s age of automation and artificial intelligence, factory floors are increasingly filled with robots. That means US factories require fewer workers with specialized skills.\n \n\n   \n  Like at Steinway, where making pianos suitable for the world’s best concert halls isn’t a quick process. Building a piano takes Steinway’s skilled craftsmen 11 months from start to finish. On average, workers complete only four or five pianos a day.\n \n\n   \n  And because the piano’s many components are domestically sourced, Steiner said tariffs haven’t impacted them significantly.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s minor impacts in certain materials, but because we manufacture in the United States, it’s not a major issue for us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Maintaining a consistent workforce\n \n\n   \n  While top-of-the-line pricing and domestic sourcing can solve a lot of problems for Steinway, it can’t solve them all.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest challenges facing the piano maker is a potential shortage of Sitka spruce lumber, which Steiner said makes the very best instruments.\n \n\n   \n  “For the Sitka spruce, we find that the best in the world comes from a particular part of Alaska where there’s a very short growing season,” he said. “As a consequence, the trees grow very slowly.”\n \n\n   \n  And Steinway needs to make sure one other component is in good supply: skilled workers.\n \n\n   \n  The factory in Astoria has been in almost continuous operation since 1873, with only temporary pauses in piano production during the Great Depression and World War II. During that time, the company produced glider parts for the war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It not only kept the lights on, so to speak, but it kept some of the valued craftspeople around,” said Anthony Gilroy, Steinway’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications. “The Steinways were smart enough to know that after the war you’d get a lot of people coming back willing to work but without the skills to build pianos, and you needed these old timers, if you will, here in the factory to train the next generation of piano makers.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of the reason Steinway & Sons has never considered relocating out of New York City. It’s those highly specific jobs – performed by “old timers” like 30-year craftsman Craddock in the frame assembly department – why Steinway keeps calling Astoria home.\n \n\n   \n  “The skills that they have, you can’t replicate it. You can’t just open up a factory somewhere else and have those skills,” said Steiner. “So long as our craftspeople are here I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t be, then we’ll still be making our pianos here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/snap-food-stamps-november-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Millions of Americans at Risk of Losing Food Stamps Next Month Amid Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Americans are at risk of losing access to food stamps in November due to the federal government shutdown, with the USDA warning that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of funds in two weeks.

losing food stamps next month amid shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roughly 42 million people are at risk of losing critical food assistance in November amid the federal government shutdown. And it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will step in to find the funds to continue paying benefits, as it has with  other priorities .\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program will run out of money in two weeks, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “So you’re talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families, of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Like other members of the Trump administration, Rollins cast blame on the Democrats,  posting on X  Thursday that they are putting “their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued Republicans are at fault for being unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes the extension of  expiring enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Rollins’ comments came a week after the US Department of Agriculture told states that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues. The agency asked states to hold off on November payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n    Debate over contingency funding\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s largest anti-hunger program, SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, but November benefits are expected to total around $8 billion. The USDA’s shutdown plan noted multi-year contingency funding is available to fund benefits in the event of a lapse.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the USDA intends to make at least a partial benefit payment next month, a senior agency official pointed to Rollins’ comments that the program’s funding will be depleted in two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the Trump administration for requiring states to halt the process of issuing monthly benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a deliberate and unprecedented decision intended to inflict pain on millions of hardworking American families — the federal government should instead do everything in its power to prioritize our most vulnerable and make funding available for this critical program,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats over approving a federal spending package for the current fiscal year. The impasse forced the federal government to shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  However, there is not enough of that tariff revenue to also shore up the food stamp program for November, a senior USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The looming lack of funding is already forcing 17 states to stop accepting new food stamp applications. That’s because their systems would require them to send partial October payments with November’s benefits. Other states are able to separate payments for the two months and can distribute October’s aid to new enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January.

King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,” Prince Andrew said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace.\n \n\n   \n  The change will take effect immediately, a royal source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew has faced mounting public pressure over his relationship with the disgraced

most important swing of the bat by a  Mariner  in 30 years happened on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n   Eugenio Suárez  approached the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the score tied at two each. Moments later, he hit just the second grand slam in franchise postseason history to give Seattle a 6-2 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays  and put the Mariners closer to the World Series than they have ever been.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been waiting for games like this my whole career,” said Suárez in an emotional postgame press conference to which he brought his two daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I had it. Today I had it in front of our crowd, in front of my family – my two daughters, my wife. The moment is very special right now.”\n \n\n   \n  After defeating the New York Yankees in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) – a win which many believed  saved baseball in Seattle  – the Mariners came within two wins of the World Series in the resulting Championship Series but ultimately lost out to Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Five years later they were within two victories of the promised land once again, but could not get past the Yankees.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Seattle needs just one more win to erase its unwanted record of being the only active major league franchise never to make it to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  “After Geno’s grand slam, I’m not sure I’ve heard that building any louder than that,” said Mariners manager Dan Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you emotional thinking about that, and just how loud it was in that moment. Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, and they don’t remember a time that it was this loud before.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Blue Jays had tied the series with two alarmingly comfortable wins in Seattle in Games 3 and 4, Suárez got the Mariners on the board with a solo home run to left field in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  A magnificent double play from Cal Raleigh got Seattle out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, but the Blue Jays struck back after Mariners starter Bryce Miller was surprisingly sat down in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  A two-out double from George Springer brought home Addison Barger in the fifth to tie the game, before Ernie Clement’s single drove in Alejando Kirk an inning later.\n \n\n   \n  By the eighth inning, the Mariners were facing the serious possibility of having to win both games in Toronto to take the series. But they found a spark from a familiar source, Raleigh tying the game with a floaty fly ball which hung in the air for 6.7 seconds before just barely clearing the wall in left field.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for about an hour,” smiled Wilson after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh’s homer – his fourth this postseason and his 64th including the regular season – means he is now tied with Aaron Judge in 2022 for the most in a single year in the American League.\n \n\n   \n  It was also Seattle’s first game-tying or go-ahead home run in the eighth inning or later of a playoff game since Bret Boone in Game 4 of the 2001 American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  Having waited 24 years for such a dramatic postseason homer, Seattle fans were treated to another just moments later when Suárez’s heroics gave the Mariners an insurmountable lead.\n \n\n   \n  They now lead the series 3-2 and go back on the road.

migrant crackdown in Chicago  and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing.\n \n\n   \n  These issues have been particularly notable in three prominent incidents: the arrest of a WGN employee, the shooting of a US citizen accused of ramming police vehicles and ICE’s detention of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  A closer look at the incidents underscores the broader skepticism of the Department of Homeland Security’s statements as federal agents have moved into city streets in Chicago and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a  federal judge temporarily halted  the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents.\n \n\n   \n  A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused.\n \n\n   \n  “A lawyer’s credibility isn’t just about personal integrity; it’s a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS’s problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department’s work and its attorneys’ trustworthiness.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of WGN employee\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the  Chicago TV station WGN .\n \n\n   \n  In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she’s obstructing justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said he did not witness Brockman’s interaction with the agents before she was detained.\n \n\n   \n  Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia  McLaughlin said in a post on X  that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin’s version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Car ramming suspect and firearm\n \n\n   \n  DHS’s statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a  post on X  that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A  DHS press release  repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente has disputed the government’s account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez’s vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they’ve been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think anybody who sees what’s going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of Massachusetts teen\n \n\n   \n  A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was  detained by ICE  and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.\n \n\n   \n  The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS official,  posted on X  what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”\n \n\n   \n  Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”\n \n\n   \n  He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.\n \n\n   \n    Judge calls for use of body cameras\n\n \n\n   \n  Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was  initially described by Minneapolis Police  as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.\n \n\n   \n  “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they’re happening frequently.”\n \n\n   \n  The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will  require all agents with body cameras  to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/kim-jong-un-donald-trump-asia-trip","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump Officials Quietly Discussing Kim Jong Un Meeting During Upcoming Asia Trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump administration officials are quietly considering a potential summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during Trump’s upcoming Asia trip.

Trump’s initial outreach to the North Korean leader earlier this year never received a reply because the North Koreans would not accept the letter, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For the upcoming trip, the White House has instead been far more  focused on arranging a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping  amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting while he’s on his trip to Asia. In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a  handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone  in less than 48 hours after the president  tweeted an invitation  to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s personal interest in a potential sit-down with Kim was  initially piqued after Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung  at the White House in August, the sources said. During their meeting, Lee formally invited Trump to attend the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers in South Korea and suggested the setting could provide Trump with a prime opportunity to meet with Kim, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was open to the idea, telling Lee he would look into it.\n \n\n   \n  “I will do that, and we’ll have talks. He’d like to meet with me,” Trump said of the North Korean leader. “We look forward to meeting with him, and we’ll make relations better.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Kim also expressed an openness to sitting down with Trump during a speech before the North Korean parliament last month, according to comments carried by North Korean state media.\n \n\n   \n  “Personally, I still have good memories of US President Trump,” Kim said during his speech, per the reports. “If the US drops its hollow obsession with denuclearization and wants to pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea based on the recognition of reality, there is no reason for us not to sit down with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  But things have shifted since Trump met Kim in 2019 at Panmunjom on the border that divides the two Koreas. South Korea played a major part in bringing North Korea back to the table and laying the groundwork for that meeting, in which Trump become the first US president step foot in the isolated and reclusive North.\n \n\n   \n  Ties between the two Koreas were much warmer then. South Korea’s new president has only been in power a few months and has yet to undo the legacy of his predecessor, who was far more hawkish towards Kim’s regime.\n \n\n   \n  According to South Korea’s Unification Ministry, there is no ongoing communication between South and North Korea regarding a possible North Korea-US summit.\n \n\n   \n  And while White House security teams have made two trips to South Korea to scout out locations ahead of Trump’s arrival, none of those trips was to the Panmunjom area, a South Korean government source said, suggesting a repeat of  the 2019 summit with Kim  is not in the cards for now.\n \n\n   \n  The White House declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n    A hastily arranged handshake\n \n\n   \n  The high-profile summits between Trump and Kim during the president’s first term failed to accomplish the president’s main goal: reining in North Korea’s nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Their meetings in Hanoi and Singapore came after intense prep work between the two sides that focused heavily on logistics and substance. As a result, administration officials and experts believe that if they were to meet again, both sides would have to be making arrangements now.\n \n\n   \n  But not every engagement between the two leaders was built upon the prolonged planning of working-level officials. The last meeting between Trump and Kim in 2019 was arranged hastily after the president tweeted an invitation to get together.\n \n\n   \n  The post abruptly set the wheels into motion for the two to meet at the DMZ – a now famous visit that resulted in Trump briefly stepping over the demarcation line into North Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of that invitation, there had not been any active communications between the two sides for months, CNN previously reported. Rather, Trump had departed his last summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi earlier that year without a deal or any signs of progress, signaling the breakdown of diplomatic efforts at the highest level.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to walk,”  Trump said during  a news conference following the conclusion of the Hanoi summit, which broke up earlier than planned. “This was just one of those times.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s 2019 South Korea trip, his former North Korea staffers had considered trying to organize another meeting between the two leaders, but ultimately decided against it because they did not think that the moment was ripe to draw North Korea back to the table, according to former administration officials.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, however, when Trump began expressing interest in a sit down while he was on the ground in Asia.\n \n\n   \n  The president mentioned a possible meeting when he met with Chinese leader Xi at the time. He asked his then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he thought it would be a good idea, according to a former administration official. Pompeo said he would look into it. To the surprise of many of the members of the team working on the North Korea portfolio, Trump’s tweet went out the next morning.\n \n\n   \n  “After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!” Trump tweeted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials immediately went into overdrive as they tried to figure out if Kim would accept. A Korean Central News Agency article came out hours after Trump’s tweet signaling Pyongyang’s openness to the meeting – something the Trump administration closely noted, the former official said. While the article stated that the North Koreans did not know the purpose of the meeting, they did not close the door on the possibility. Administration officials at that point believed a meeting was highly likely, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration then activated the US-North Korea hotline located at the DMZ that is manned 24/7 by a US military officer who speaks Korean. But the calls went unanswered. Then they turned to another tactic that they had used before: a bullhorn. A US military officer went to the border and used the bullhorn to project the message to the North Korean side that the US was trying to communicate with them about a leader-level meeting, the former official said. On the other side, a North Korean recorded the message but did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the hotline rang with an invitation for a US delegation to come to North Korea for a planning meeting. The US delegation, which included the Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, State Department official Kevin Kim and the NSA Senior Director for the Korean Peninsula Allison Hooker, flew from Seoul to the DMZ the same night that Trump’s tweet had been sent, where they met for about an hour with their North Korean counterparts. The two sides discussed the possible meeting but nothing was formally agreed to, and the Trump administration officials left with North Korea’s request for a detailed proposal by midnight. That proposal was faxed to Pyongyang when the officials returned to Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s response did not come overnight, and in the morning, US officials were monitoring every possible channel closely. Then a clear signal came through: the North Koreans had sent an expansive team to clean their side of the space along the Military Demarcation Line that divides North and South Korea, which was highly unusual. Then the hotline rang, and the news came that Kim Jong Un would partake in the meeting with Trump later that day.\n \n\n   \n  As he approached the North Korean leader, Trump took 20 steps into the country, making history as the first sitting US leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom. The two leaders then shook hands and met for about an hour.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/donald-trump-new-jersey-virginia-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-04:00","title":"Donald Trump is not on the ballot, but he’s a major factor in the November elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite not being on the ballot, Donald Trump remains a major influence in the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.

Mikie Sherrill. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Facing a fierce fight, Sherrill is quick to invoke Trump in a different way, telling supporters: “That tariff plan? It’s a world-wide extortion scheme so that the Trump family can make billions of dollars. That is not creating opportunity for anyone in New Jersey.”\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states in the country that hold gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential campaign. The races could provide an early glimpse at the mood of the electorate, particularly toward the president’s party, but also as a test of enthusiasm as Democrats scramble to rebuild.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is keeping a close eye on both contests, yet Trump has only made a formal endorsement in New Jersey. He is poised to record messages on behalf of Ciattarelli and hold telephone rallies for his campaign, both of which are intended to specifically remind Trump voters about the urgency of the Nov. 4 contest.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re deploying his help in very strategic ways,” said Ciattarelli, who is seeking to walk a careful line of tapping into forces of the MAGA movement, while trying to dampen criticism of being too aligned with Trump. “This race is about New Jersey. It’s not about the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the government shutdown hangs over the race, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. The contest between former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, is seen as less competitive, which is among the reasons that aides to Trump say he has kept more of a distance.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey gains\n \n\n   \n  It’s far from certain how successful attempts to insert Trump into the race will be – or whether they could backfire on Democrats. He made significant gains in both states last fall, but his improvement was particularly notable in New Jersey, where Trump lost by 6 points after a punishing 16-point defeat in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Spanberger, who were among the Democrats elected to Congress in 2018 during the first midterm election of Trump’s presidency, are relying less on arguments of protecting democracy and more on the tangible impacts of Trump’s policies in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  When the president said from the Oval Office this week that he “terminated” the Gateway tunnel, a $16 billion commuter rail between New Jersey and New York, as retribution to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, Sherrill seized on the moment. She said New Jersey would lose tens of thousands of jobs and residents would suffer because of Trump’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  “We see an out of control president, just at his whim, saying he’s going to cancel it,” Sherrill told reporters Thursday. “We are going to stand up and fight for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than three weeks before the election, the president’s words injected a fresh headache into the race for Ciattarelli and set the table for a real-world test of his embrace of Trump. He said he supported the “a critical infrastructure project,” adding New Jersey needed a new governor who had a good relationship “and when necessary, disagree” with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump effect is on full display in dueling campaign ads, where Sherill repeatedly calls her rival “Jack Ciattarelli, the Trump of Trenton.” Ciattarelli fires back, saying: “New Jersey’s a mess and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump. Come on.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s also playing out on the debate stage when candidates were asked to grade Trump’s performance. Ciattarelli gave him an “A,” saying: “I think he’s right about everything he’s doing.” Sherrill blasted her opponent and his support of Trump, declaring: “I’d give him an F.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Banking on that voters’ remorse’\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, it’s yet another test of how many Trump voters will cast ballots in elections in which his name is not on the ballot. The outcome could provide important lessons for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress on the line.\n \n\n   \n  With early voting well underway in New Jersey and Virginia, conversations with voters suggest an exhaustion factor with Trump. Yet, for many, it’s unclear whether the president will be a deciding factor in a race driven by economic concerns like affordability and a call for change.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill is seeking to replace New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, who has been in office for eight years. Not since 1961 have Democrats won three consecutive elections as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not Trump’s race, it’s Jack’s race,” said Kathy Mueller Rohan, a voter from Morris County, New Jersey, which Trump narrowly carried last fall after losing it by about 4 points in 2020. “I don’t think he needs Trump to win.”\n \n\n   \n  But she believes the president could be helpful, particularly in places where he gained ground. New Jersey is among the states that saw some of the biggest swings toward Republicans in his third presidential election, particularly in non-white communities, which is one of the reasons Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Sherrill-Ciattarelli race.\n \n\n   \n  “Quite frankly we’re concerned Donald Trump won Passaic County in last year’s election, so we have our work cut out for us,” said Mayor Andre Sayegh of Paterson, who supports Sherrill. “We’re being very aggressive in attempting to organize and motivate voters turned off by Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The shift towards Trump in Passaic County, home to a large Hispanic community, is one of many painful snapshots of the last election that has not been forgotten by Democrats. It’s a county that Joe Biden won by more than 16 points in 2020 and Trump won by nearly 3 points in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Sayegh, whose office walls are decorated with pictures of John F. Kennedy, said cultural issues have driven many voters in his area away from the Democratic Party. He believes this election is an opportunity for Democrats to rebuild and, perhaps, rebrand.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not a year ago – now he’s in!” Sayegh said, reflecting on the first year of Trump’s second term. “People, quite frankly, may have voters’ remorse. We’re banking on that voters’ remorse.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/africa/gen-z-topples-madagascars-president-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:46:00-04:00","title":"Gen Z protesters toppled Madagascar’s president.

Should other African leaders worry? \n       \n  By Nimi Princewill, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:46 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  This week, the military in Madagascar grabbed power as youth-led protests escalated, forcing President Andry Rajoelina to flee.\n \n\n   \n  The scenario was a familiar one for Rajoelina, 51, a former DJ, who was initially brought to power by the military in 2009 after another youth-driven uprising sent his predecessor into exile.\n \n\n   \n  Events in Madagascar reflect a broader trend of similar protests in recent years, impacting countries across Africa, Asia and South America.\n \n\n   \n  Although the protests differ in their specific causes, they share a common characteristic: they are primarily led by Generation Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s), who are voicing their dissatisfaction with their governments.\n \n\n   \n  Technology is also a common feature of the protests, which are organized and mobilized through social media.\n \n\n   \n  In  Nepal , a Gen Z movement fuelled by outrage over a social media ban, government corruption and limited economic opportunities led to the ousting of the prime minister in September.\n \n\n   \n  This followed a similar change in  Bangladesh  in 2024. The Bangladeshi ‘ Gen Z revolution’  involved weeks of intense protests, predominantly led by students, and resulted in the ousting of the nation’s long-serving leader Sheikh Hasina.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, in 2022, youth protesters in  Sri Lanka  also succeeded in toppling the ruling regime.\n \n\n   \n  For Madagascar’s Gen Z, removing their president was a priority. However, while Bangladeshis saw a Nobel Peace Prize winner replace Hasina, Madagascar’s president was replaced by the military – meaning the country’s youth may have to wait for their choice of leader.\n \n\n   \n  Madagascar is now  under the control of Michael Randrianirina , the commander of a powerful army unit that previously supported Rajoelina’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the movement, Elliot Randriamandrato, told news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that “the past few weeks are a half-victory, the real struggle begins now.”\n \n\n   \n  But he believes Rajoelina’s removal was expedited by the military’s involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “People need to understand that one couldn’t have happened without the other,” Randriamandrato told AFP. “Just the military, it wouldn’t have been possible. Just us, it would’ve taken months, even though we were ready for that. The turning point came from the convergence of both.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘African leaders should be wary’\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether what happened in Madagascar will be repeated elsewhere on the continent.\n \n\n   \n  Young people in Africa have been increasingly vocal, calling for major reforms amid growing unrest. The continent has the  world’s youngest population .\n \n\n   \n  In North Africa, young Moroccans have coalesced under the banner of the  “GenZ 212” movement , named after the nation’s international dialling code.\n \n\n   \n  They are critical of the Moroccan government’s priorities, faulting authorities for investments in sports infrastructure which they say overshadow healthcare and education. Recent demonstrations have led to deadly confrontations and  reports of police violence .\n \n\n   \n  In East Africa, Kenya  witnessed protests  stemming from a contentious finance bill that raised taxes during a cost-of-living crisis. These grievances have morphed into calls for regime change, with numerous fatalities reported.\n \n\n   \n  Kingsley Moghalu, a former presidential candidate from Nigeria and a public policy expert, told CNN that these movements signify a growing consciousness among young people of their political power.\n \n\n   \n  Moghalu warns that “underperforming African leaders should be very wary.”\n \n\n   \n  Rajoelina’s removal might rejuvenate protest movements that have lost momentum across the continent, according to Swikani Ncube, a lecturer at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Mass protests in Kenya have not occurred since July. Similarly, a youth uprising in  Mozambique , following a disputed election last year, has been suppressed.\n \n\n   \n  “Where these (protests) had died down, the perceived successes of the youth in Madagascar may serve as a reference point for those who were either losing steam or simply second-guessing their intentions to embark on sustained protests,” Ncube told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Resistance from African Leaders\n \n\n   \n  As youth protests grow stronger, African governments, particularly those that are military-led, are unlikely to surrender their positions without a fight. Even civilian-led administrations have proven survival skills.\n \n\n   \n  In Kenya, President William Ruto, facing increasing pressure to resign, dared his critics to oust him from office before the next elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell those characters giving us lectures that they can change this administration using violence and unlawful means before 2027, let them try,” he  said in July , in response to violent demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  In neighboring Uganda, protests inspired by demonstrations in Kenya took place last year, organized by young people denouncing government corruption. During these protests, dozens of activists were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  President Yoweri Museveni, 81, has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for nearly four decades. He warned earlier that demonstrators were  “playing with fire.” \n \n\n   \n  Museveni plans to run for a seventh term in office next year, but he faces a potential challenge from  Bobi Wine , the country’s main opposition leader who is 43 years old. Wine has experienced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years.\n \n\n   \n  In Madagascar, Rajoelina has shown no signs of relinquishing power following his removal. Although he’s in exile, he hasn’t formally resigned and calls his ousting a coup.\n \n\n   \n    What’s wrong with governance in Africa?\n \n\n   \n  Africa is no stranger to coups or swift changes in government. Security remains a major challenge, with the Sahel – a region stretching from Senegal to Sudan – accounting for more than half  the terror-related deaths worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, populations have been frustrated by their leaders’ inability to tackle corruption or deliver much-needed jobs and services.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure of governance in Africa is the most important challenge facing the continent, and it’s very deep-rooted,” said Moghalu.\n \n\n   \n  What makes the Gen Z movement so dangerous to African leaders is that the continent is home to some of the world’s poorest countries, and unemployment is rampant, particularly among young people who make up over half of the population.\n \n\n   \n  Although the demands of young people vary across the continent, Moghalu highlighted a common thread: “Their decision to vent their frustration (on issues plaguing the continent) and take action, rather than bottle it up.”\n \n\n   \n  If these challenges persist, youth-led uprisings are likely to become a regular occurrence in Africa, he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “The Gen Z are an impatient and assertive generation. And the rise of technology makes it easier for them to mobilize.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/travel/travel-news-nazi-underground-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Deep underground, the Nazis built a city for thousands of soldiers.

In the 1980s and ‘90s, a subculture known as the Bunker People took over the tunnels, hosting unauthorized and often dangerous events here, from raves to weddings. Today, bats are its inhabitants, some 40,000 of them taking refuge in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  In the 21st century, it’s been given new life as a dark tourism destination, with 19 miles of tunnels open to explore in the Międzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum.

The 180-foot Passage of Commodus takes its name from Emperor Commodus, who you may remember as the conniving meanie portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in “Gladiator.” Experts believe he once survived an  assassination attempt  here. He would later meet his end being strangled by a champion wrestler.\n \n\n   \n  Fans of secret underground complexes will have much to celebrate when The London Tunnels opens in the UK capital, with a speculative date of 2028. This mile-long series of chambers was built to shelter citizens in World War II, before becoming the home of Britain’s Special Operations Executive, an offshoot of MI6 and the real-life inspiration for James Bond’s Q Branch.

Abandoned by its occupants and haunted by the past, it’s now a ghost town, a physical reminder of darker times following the Greco-Turkish war.\n \n\n   \n  Its crumbling buildings swallowed by greenery are starkly beautiful and deeply eerie, even more so as the cooler seasons creep in and sea mists descend. Today’s visitors pay a three-euro fee to wander its uneven lanes and alleyways. Here’s  what CNN discovered  on its visit.\n \n\n   \n   Babylon , in modern Iraq, meanwhile, was the jewel of Mesopotamia and one of the most important cities in antiquity. Today, its ancient ruins are a site in distress, its paths overgrown and facilities scarce. But when the late afternoon sun hangs heavy over Hillah, its steps and statues bathed in heat and light, visitors still feel that they are standing in the footprints of kings.\n \n\n   \n    America’s most haunted\n \n\n   \n  The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia looks like the asylum of nightmares and for many, it was. But it started out as a place of compassion whose massive overcrowding led to desperate measures by doctors and staff. Daily and nightly tours now offer visitors its complex history, along with an occasional paranormal scare.\n \n\n   \n  Many former asylums are now macabre tourist attractions, whose treatment of their subject matter can range from the sensitive to the sensationalist.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/economy/trump-xi-tariff-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The latest chapter of the Trump-Xi ‘situationship’ explained","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have resurfaced in October 2025, following a brief period of truce.

‘situationship’ explained \n       \n  Analysis by Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Another spat between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies has quickly escalated, and if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don’t lower the temperature soon, both nations stand to pay an exorbitant price.\n \n\n   \n  Sky-high tariffs had brought trade between the two countries to a screeching halt earlier this year, before they reached a monthslong truce and substantially lowered levies on one another.\n \n\n   \n  But trade tensions have reignited, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs  starting at 130%  on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the 30% minimum rate currently in effect. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate to all these actions.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump sounded confident he and Xi could resolve matters amicably, telling reporters that he intends to still meet with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who helps lead trade negotiations with China, said Friday that “things have deescalated” recently.\n \n\n   \n  But that was Friday. At any second, the tide could turn.\n \n\n   \n  So, how did we get here?\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s qualms with China\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month,  Beijing announced  plans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics. Under the new rules set to take effect later this year, five rare-earth elements were added to China’s existing list of seven other highly restricted rare-earth exports.\n \n\n   \n  Furthermore, China’s plan calls for mandated licenses for technology needed to mine, smelt and process rare earths, and to make magnets. Foreign governments and businesses would also need licenses to exchange Chinese-sourced rare earths or technology containing them.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s Ministry of Commerce said the restrictions aim to prevent materials from “being used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields.”\n \n\n   \n  A day after Beijing announced those measures, Trump took to Truth Social, saying, “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one.”\n \n\n   \n  He went on to say that China has “quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position” with rare earths and called the new restrictions “a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.”\n \n\n   \n  US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has worked on trade agreements with China alongside Bessent, said last week: “It’s a clear repudiation of everything we’ve been working towards for the last six months, which was a stable tariff situation and a continued flow of rare earths.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s provoked China\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s actions came after a series of moves Washington took that drew the ire of Chinese counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  Among them were  ramped-up restrictions  on worldwide exports to Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, of any parts of products manufactured using American equipment or software.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce called the move announced last month “extremely malicious,” adding that the country would “take necessary measures” to protect the rights and interests of its companies.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration earlier this month also started taxing Chinese ships docked at American ports as well as products transported on Chinese-made ships. Beijing responded with a tit-for-tat fee at its ports.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, meanwhile, up until recently, kept extremely tight restrictions on exports of highly advanced chips, aiming to prevent Beijing from making more advancements in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  A meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC could be an opportunity to hash out their differences face to face as opposed to through American and Chinese officials. But things could just as easily devolve, pushing the two nations even further apart.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/gop-rhetoric-no-kings-protests-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the ‘No Kings’ rallies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Republican Party, led by Donald Trump and key figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep.

the ‘No Kings’ rallies \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and his allies have spent weeks painstakingly trying to manufacture an image of an irredeemably violent American left.\n \n\n   \n  This despite a series of  rulings from judges , including several Republican-appointed ones, saying the image being painted is a mirage. And it’s despite  hard data  showing that, even as left-wing violence has increased this year, it still  pales to decades of right-wing violence .\n \n\n   \n  But ahead of the “No Kings” rallies across the country on Saturday, the GOP’s effort has taken a rather stunning turn.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump team and its allies suggested that the rallies, which are likely to draw millions of people, will essentially be chock full of antifa, terrorist sympathizers and even terrorists themselves.\n \n\n   \n  It’s baseless and ugly, yes. But it’s also highly suspect strategically.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP rhetoric surrounding this and the Democratic base more broadly has grown remarkably pitched.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has called them “hate America” rallies and said it’s “all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  A member of his leadership team, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, described the rallies as being held by the “terrorist wing” of the party.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas predicted that “paid protesters” and “agitators” would require calling in the National Guard.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the “No Kings” protests were “part of antifa.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted they would feature the “most unhinged in the Democratic Party.”\n \n\n   \n  Others have stepped up their rhetoric about the left in other contexts.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested the fact that protesters might be provided matching signs could  somehow be evidence of antifa funding . (Trump’s own rallies often include people holding matching signs that were handed out, as  comedian Jimmy Kimmel noted .)\n \n\n   \n  And White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued perhaps the most extreme comments Thursday on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrat Party’s main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” Leavitt said.\n \n\n   \n  The first thing to note is that the kinds of broad brushes being employed here are exactly the kinds of broad brushes Republicans have previously decried.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve spent years assailing Hillary Clinton for putting large numbers of Trump supporters in what she called a “basket of deplorables.” Even less than a year ago, they were seemingly apoplectic about President Joe Biden  arguably calling some Trump supporters “garbage.” \n \n\n   \n  Leavitt herself cast the latter episode as proof that Biden and Kamala Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support” Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The comments also come even as Republicans after Charlie Kirk’s assassination sought to link the coarsening of our rhetoric – things like calling Trump a “fascist” – to political violence.\n \n\n   \n  Does that not also apply to calling wide swaths of the electorate terrorist sympathizers? The administration has now moved from decrying those broad brushes to embracing them.\n \n\n   \n  But even beyond that, it’s a weird strategy.\n \n\n   \n  These aren’t the first “No Kings” rallies, after all. They were also held across the country back in June, and they were overwhelmingly peaceful. The  scenes  were largely full of very normal-looking, liberal Americans speaking their minds.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News this week managed to find  five incidents of violence and/or arrests  from the June rallies – rallies which, again, drew millions.\n \n\n   \n  But two of them were actually  alleged attacks   against  the protesters , with people allegedly targeting them with motor vehicles. In another case in Florida,  2 of 3 people arrested were counter-protesters . A fourth example was a  deadly shooting by a “peacekeeper”  who apparently feared someone was about to carry out a mass shooting. (As of last month, it  wasn’t clear  that either the peacekeeper or the other man would even face charges.)\n \n\n   \n  Anything can happen on Saturday, but the scenes could also provide a rather rapid counterpoint to the alternate reality the GOP is attempting to paint.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic politicians like  California Gov. Gavin Newsom  and  many   others  this week have made a point to emphasize these comments reinforce the need to keep the proceedings peaceful. Some have warned those assembled not to give the administration any scenes that might give it pretexts for Trump’s militarization of the homeland.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona said Trump is “trying to incite violence as a justification just for more control.”\n \n\n   \n  If anything, the scenes in Portland, Oregon, in recent weeks suggest such messages are being received.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters there have taken to  wearing costumes and otherwise engaging in light-hearted forms of protest . Their efforts appear aimed at betraying the ridiculousness of Trump’s decision to send in the National Guard. A Trump-appointed judge has said the administration’s claims of violence in Portland – which Trump has labeled “war ravaged” – are “ untethered to the facts .”\n \n\n   \n  To this point, Trump’s argument that the left is unusually violent doesn’t appear to have penetrated American public opinion.\n \n\n   \n  A  Marquette University Law School poll  last month showed Americans are about evenly split on whether left-wing violence or right-wing violence was a bigger problem. And a  CBS News-YouGov poll  this month actually showed significantly more Americans called the Republican Party “extreme” (59%) as said the same about the Democratic Party (46%).\n \n\n   \n  The stakes here are huge. To the extent Trump can turn this into reality in Americans’ minds, it opens the door to all kinds of powers he craves. That’s not just when it comes to militarizing US soil, but also wielding heavy-handed tools to crack down on the political left, as he’s made clear he’d very much like to do.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday begins a new phase in this high-stakes moment for our country.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/weather/severe-storms-tornado-south-midwest-forecast-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-04:30","title":"Severe Thunderstorms with Dangerous Winds, Isolated Tornadoes Threaten South and Midwest This Weekend","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe thunderstorms with dangerous winds, isolated tornadoes, and large hail are threatening parts of the South and Midwest this weekend, including Northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and areas from Arkansas to the mid-Mississippi Valley.

Large hail, from quarter-size to possibly as large as golf balls, could also accompany a few of the storms.\n \n\n   \n  Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Paducah, Kentucky, are some of the cities where people should stay alert for severe weather warnings while tackling weekend plans.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain could also trigger flash flooding in spots, though much of the region is so dry, the downpours are needed.  Moderate to severe drought  covers a large chunk of the lower and mid-Mississippi valleys as well as the Ozarks of southern Missouri and northeast Arkansas.\n \n\n   \n    An unusually warm Gulf is fueling this threat\n \n\n   \n  Fall typically brings to mind cool, crisp air and blue skies, but the United States is seeing unusually warm air stream northward ahead of a cold front in the central part of the country.

Storms riding the jet stream can turn severe anytime southerly winds pull up warm, humid air from the Gulf. Gulf waters are unusually warm right now, adding an extra punch of moisture to this weekend’s setup.\n \n\n   \n  The South and, occasionally, lower parts of the Midwest like the Ohio and mid-Mississippi valleys tend to be the regions most affected by severe thunderstorms in fall and winter. In some cases, a major winter storm will dump heavy snow in northern areas, while the South contends with a springlike severe storm threat from the same system.\n \n\n   \n  And with the loss of daylight in those months, there is a greater chance the threat of dangerous storms carries into the evening and overnight hours. Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly than daytime ones, a  2022 study  found.\n \n\n   \n  Colder weather is coming in the weeks and months ahead, but severe storms will no doubt make an appearance at times, so it’s important to stay vigilant and have a preparedness plan in place year-round.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/trump-tomahawk-missiles-ukraine-white-house-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"02:15:00-04:00","title":"Trump denies Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, urges both sides to ‘stop the war immediately’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Washington to request Tomahawk cruise missiles for targeted strikes on Russian energy facilities, believing they would weaken Russia’s war economy.

Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:15 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to obtain Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russia from a meeting with Donald Trump on Friday, with the US president later calling for both sides to cease fighting and accept current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had traveled to Washington hoping to receive the long-range cruise missiles, which he believes could deliver a decisive blow to the Kremlin’s war economy by enabling targeted strikes on oil and energy facilities deep inside Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, during opening remarks at a White House working lunch, Trump expressed  hopes to resolve the war  “without thinking about Tomahawks,” adding that the weapon is one America “needs.”\n \n\n   \n  And Zelensky appeared to come away empty-handed, describing the meeting as “productive” but declining to comment further on Tomahawks because the US “doesn’t want escalation.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, Trump made a public call for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters upon landing in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “And both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing. And that should be it,” he added, saying that he’d communicated that sentiment to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came a day after Trump spoke on the phone with Putin and  agreed to meet him  soon in Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  During that call, Putin is said to have stressed that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield. But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n    Why is Ukraine seeking Tomahawk missiles?\n \n\n   \n  Tomahawk missiles have a significantly longer range than any others in Ukraine’s current armory.\n \n\n   \n  Although Trump has  tempered discussions  regarding their delivery, he has not definitely ruled it out.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Friday’s White House meeting, Zelensky appeared to suggest a trade of Ukrainian drones for US Tomahawks.\n \n\n   \n  “Ukraine has thousands of our production drones but we don’t have Tomahawks,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They (US) can have our thousands of drones, that’s where we can work together.”\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky briefed European leaders virtually following his meeting with Trump. The leaders reiterated their “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to reporters, the Ukrainian leader reaffirmed his trust in Trump wanting to finish the war, adding “it was also difficult to manage the situation in the Middle East, and the president was successful in it.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump stopped short of offering a view on whether Ukraine would need to cede territory as part of a peace settlement with Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has taken divergent stances on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his meeting with Putin in August, he said “land swaps” would be necessary for the war to end.\n \n\n   \n  Later, he changed his mind, saying he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory now occupied by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  In comments Friday, Trump did allow for the possibility that Putin may be stringing him along in a bid to gain time to complete his war aims in Ukraine, but concluded: “I think that he wants to make a deal.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” he added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/americas/made-in-guatemala-working-conditions-as-equals-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"The truth behind your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article exposes the hidden realities of Guatemalan garment factories (maquilas), where women workers endure long hours, wage theft, sexual harassment, and threats—often under the control of Korean-owned companies.

Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Video Journalist: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/alaska-storm-damage-evacuees-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-10:17","title":"Alaska storm damage so bad many evacuees won’t go home for at least 18 months, governor says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful storm driven by Typhoon Halong, behaving like a Category 2 hurricane, caused catastrophic flooding in remote Alaska villages, particularly in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, destroying 90% of homes in Kipnuk and damaging over one-third in Kwigillingok.

Mike Dunleavy said in a request to the White House for a major disaster declaration.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the hardest hit villages, Kipnuk, an initial assessment showed that 121 homes — or 90% of the total — have been destroyed, Dunleavy wrote. In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.\n \n\n   \n  The remnants of Typhoon Halong struck the area with the ferocity of a Category 2 hurricane, Dunleavy said, sending a surge of high surf into the low-lying region. One person was killed, two remain missing, and rescue crews plucked dozens of people from their homes as they floated away.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have been scrambling to  airlift people  from the inundated Alaska Native villages. More than 2,000 people across the region have taken shelter — in schools in their villages, in larger communities in southwest Alaska or have been evacuated by military planes to Anchorage, the state’s largest city.\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage leaders said Friday they expect as many as 1,600 evacuees to arrive. So far about 575 have been airlifted to the city by the Alaska National Guard, and have been staying at a sports arena or a convention center. Additional flights were expected Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are working on figuring out how to move people out of shelters and into short-term accommodations, such as hotels, and then longer-term housing.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the time, space, distance, geography, and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy said. “Agencies are prioritizing rapid repairs … but it is likely that some damaged communities will not be viable to support winter occupancy, in America’s harshest climate in the U.S. Arctic.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\n \n\n   \n  The three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\n \n\n   \n  The storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\n \n\n   \n  Alexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\n \n\n   \n  At least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\n \n\n   \n  Anchorage officials and business leaders said Friday they were eager to help the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our neighbors in western Alaska have experienced tremendous loss, devastation and grief,” Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said at a meeting of the Anchorage Assembly. “We will do everything we can here in Anchorage to welcome our neighbors and help them through these difficult times.”\n \n\n   \n  State Rep. Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece.\n \n\n   \n  “We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate. She thanked Anchorage for welcoming the evacuees.\n \n\n   \n  “You are showing my people, my relatives, my constituents, even if they are far from home, this is still Alaska land and they’re amongst families,” Jimmie said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/baseball-los-angeles-dodgers-nlcs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000Z","title":"Shohei Ohtani’s Legendary Night Leads Los Angeles Dodgers to Another World Series, Sweeping Milwaukee in 4 Games","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani delivered an unprecedented performance in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, hitting three home runs, striking out 10 batters, and pitching a six-inning shutout—making him the first player in MLB history to hit three home runs and strike out 10+ batters in a single game, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.

World Series, sweeping Milwaukee in 4 games \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s once again Sho-time in the World Series.\n \n\n   \n  The Los Angeles Dodgers will have a chance to defend their World Series title in this year’s Fall Classic after a Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, clinching a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. The Dodgers were led by their otherworldly star, Shohei Ohtani, who hit three home runs, struck out 10 batters and got the win for the Dodgers.\n \n\n   \n  It was one of the greatest individual performances in the history of the game, let alone on a stage of this magnitude. Ohtani, the Japanese two-way star who has been breaking boundaries since he joined the league, looked sterling in a six-inning, shutout performance.\n \n\n   \n  And then when he walked to the plate to do something no other player does in Major League Baseball these days – hitting while being a starting pitcher – Ohtani helped himself out. He hit home runs in the first, fourth and seventh innings, with the last one sending his teammates into hysterics.\n \n\n   \n  According to MLB statistician Sarah Langs, Ohtani became the first player in league history to hit three home runs and strike out at least one batter, let alone 10. Per the TNT Sports broadcast, Ohtani became the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit a leadoff home run in the regular season or the playoffs, and the first starting pitcher since 1900 to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game.\n \n\n   \n  All of those incredible superlatives come with one other amazing fact, given that starting pitchers usually thrive on a regular five-day schedule for starts: It was the first time Ohtani had pitched in 13 days.\n \n\n   \n  He was, quite obviously, named the NLCS MVP for his performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really fun on both sides of ball today,” Ohtani said via his translator while holding the NLCS MVP trophy. “As a representative, I am taking this trophy and let’s get four more wins.”\n \n\n   \n  Far from the home runs that baseball fans are used to seeing from pitchers, Ohtani’s blasts were absolutely majestic. He led off the game for the Dodgers with a 427-foot blast, hit a gigantic 469-foot homer in the fourth and topped it off with another mega 446-foot blast in the seventh.\n \n\n   \n  “We won it as a team and this is really a team effort so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” Ohtani added.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the fifth time in the last nine seasons that the Dodgers have won the National League pennant, the 26th trip to the World Series in their history.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh my God. I’m still speechless,” Dodger first baseman Freddie Freeman said of his teammate’s performance in an interview with the TNT broadcast after the game.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes you have to check him and make sure he’s not made of steel when he does something like that. Absolutely incredible. The biggest stage and he goes and does something like that. It’ll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani Game.”\n \n\n   \n  Ohtani’s game drew the admiration from another Dodgers star, Clayton Kershaw.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know about Shohei but until you play with him and you see him, it’s just a different level,” said Kershaw, the team’s future hall of famer who is coming out of the bullpen in the playoffs.\n \n\n   \n  With the Seattle Mariners taking a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series over the Toronto Blue Jays earlier in the night, the Dodgers will have to wait to find out who their opponent will be in the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  But whoever the American League champion is will be facing a buzzsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers have lost just one game in this postseason and their pitching hasn’t allowed more than one run per game since a loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Divisional Series more than a week ago. Starters Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani make up one of the most formidable playoff rotations in recent memory and their lineup with Ohtani at the top followed by stars like Mookie Betts, Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez and a slew of others.\n \n\n   \n  “Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts said to an applauding crowd on hand at Dodger Stadium. “Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball.”\n \n\n   \n  No team has repeated as World Series champions since the New York Yankees dynasty of the last 1990s and early 2000s won three straight titles between 1998 and 2000. The Dodgers are the first team to even make it back to the World Series the year after winning it since the Phillies did it in the late 2000s.\n \n\n   \n  Kershaw is one of the few players still in the league who was playing when the Phillies made that run. He’s on his last go-round now, retiring after the season and is relishing the opportunity to make history.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to be a part of this team … I’m so happy to be a part of it. This group of guys is awesome, we have a blast and we’re playing so good. It’s just awesome. Whether I get to pitch or not, I’m just glad I get to be a part of it. It’s so fun.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/trump-maduro-tensions-venezuela-military","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump and Maduro are both amassing military forces as tensions build in the Caribbean","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As tensions escalate in the Caribbean, U.S. President Donald Trump is advancing a strategy of military and covert pressure against Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, including deploying B-52 bombers near the coast, authorizing CIA operations to target drug traffickers and migrant flows, and signaling possible strikes on Venezuelan territory.

Cohen, Ines Capdevila, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President  Donald Trump  weighs military action inside Venezuela, building up forces in the Caribbean and  flying B-52 bombers  off the country’s coast this week,  Nicolás Maduro  is responding in kind, repositioning troops, mobilizing “millions” of militia and denouncing US activity in the region – a sign of defiance from the strongman as the two leaders are locked in a standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have privately acknowledged that the  intensifying US pressure campaign  is aimed at ousting Maduro, a goal that was also a target of Trump’s first term in office when the White House recognized Venezuelan  opposition leader Juan Guaidó  as the legitimate president of the country in 2019. But as the Trump team ratchets up the pressure this fall, Maduro has in turn ramped up the rhetoric and propaganda for Venezuelans while calling for new military exercises by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, which has some 123,000 members.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, the US military has  moved warships  and other weaponry into the region and has  targeted boats  off the Venezuelan coast it says are transporting drugs. Then on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he’d  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert action in Venezuela and said the United States was considering strikes on Venezuelan territory.\n \n\n   \n  “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” the president told reporters Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training. As of October 17, 20 out of 23 Venezuelan states have been militarized as part of the Maduro’s military mobilizations, called Independence 200.\n \n\n   \n  On his Truth Social account last month, Trump mocked a video of women, some who appeared to be overweight, running with guns during a purported training for the Venezuelan militia.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been quietly laying the groundwork for potential military action inside Venezuela for months by tying Maduro to drug traffickers and cartels that officials have designated as terror groups who pose an imminent threat to the US. But to date, there is no indication that Trump has decided to take that step or target the Venezuelan leader directly.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the goal has been to pressure Maduro to step down on his own, sources told CNN, in part by establishing a credible threat of US military action if he does not. The recent strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean are a clear message to Maduro, the sources said, noting the administration has been very intentional about linking the Venezuelan leader to trafficking groups and cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Wednesday that he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would be attempting to remove Maduro. The remarks are Trump’s most expansive comments on his decision to expand the CIA’s authority to conduct lethal targeting and carry out covert action in the region, which  CNN first reported  last week.\n \n\n   \n  In a televised speech Wednesday, Maduro denounced what he described as the CIA’s record of regime change and coups d’état around the world.\n \n\n   \n  “But our people are clear, united, and aware. They have the means to once again defeat this open conspiracy against the peace and stability of Venezuela,” he said on state television.\n \n\n   \n    ‘We don’t sleep well’\n \n\n   \n  In Venezuela, daily life has continued despite the looming possibility of armed conflict with the United States. Near downtown Caracas, at the Teresa Carreño Theater, a sold-out musical premiered just days after a well-known salsa party brought together more than 1,000 people in the west of the city.\n \n\n   \n  But Venezuelans are increasingly discussing the US warships in the Caribbean Sea and the fear of a possible US attack. “Venezuelans live in anxiety thinking about what might happen,” said Ivonne Caña.\n \n\n   \n  Caña, who is a cook, said she lives in uncertainty and, worried about her family, has been buying a little more food than usual to stock up at home. The fear, she said, is felt most at night: “We don’t sleep well.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Venezuelans are cautiously showing their support for the US pressure on Maduro. In recent days, banners bearing messages such as “It’s happening… freedom loading 95%” have been displayed on at least 10 university campuses across the country — a form of peaceful protest in spaces where political issues are seldom addressed due to fear of government reprisal.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Maduro has further cracked down on civil liberties in Venezuela. At the end of September, the government announced that the president had signed a decree of “external commotion,” which he described as “a constitutional defense tool in case the country faces a military aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  The state of emergency decree would allow Maduro to restrict constitutional guarantees and, according to analysts, would grant him broad political, social and economic powers.\n \n\n   \n  As Maduro has accused the US administration of trying to steal the country’s oil wealth, the nearby American military presence has drawn closer. Three US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours on Wednesday, according to open-source flight data reviewed by CNN. The bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  Two of them kept their location beacons activated inside Venezuela’s flight information region (FIR), at one point coming within 53 miles of La Orchila Island, where Maduro’s forces carried out drills last month.\n \n\n   \n  At their closest point, the planes flew 132 miles from the Venezuelan mainland, at around 11:20 a.m. local time. The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region that is international airspace but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple sources told CNN that the recent US military strikes on drug boats are just the beginning of a larger effort to rid the region of narcotics trafficking and potentially dislodge Maduro from power. The military has carried out at least six  strikes to date  on six separate boats in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n    The Trump administration’s war on drugs\n \n\n   \n  The argument that drug traffickers pose an imminent threat to Americans is at the core of the Trump administration’s classified legal justification for carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean — and potentially beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department opinion also includes a secret and expansive list of groups the Trump administration argues can now be treated as enemy combatants, rather than criminals, and thus summarily killed without due process at the president’s direction.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts said, because it appears to  justify an open-ended war against a secret list of groups  and potentially offers a pretext for unilateral US military action against a broad array of targets in the region.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pentagon, some military lawyers, including international law experts within DoD’s Office of General Counsel, have raised concerns about the legality of the lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers, sources familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple Pentagon lawyers previously told CNN that internal dissent is unlikely to dissuade the Trump administration from continuing its military campaign in the region.\n \n\n   \n  The latest indication of internal concerns over these strikes emerged on Thursday when the admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean,  announced he is retiring  just one year into his tenure.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Adm.

for Zelensky, but Kyiv’s real prize remains out of reach – for now \n       \n  Analysis by Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:13 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The relationship between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky has unquestionably improved but the real prize Kyiv seeks seems out of its reach, for now.\n \n\n   \n  After nine months of extraordinary diplomatic acrobatics and verbiage, Trump still prefers to give Russian President Vladimir Putin yet another chance to talk him around, over blunt military escalation.\n \n\n   \n  But there were – among the fawning compliments and the conviction an elusive peace was near – bits of good news for Ukraine. Even Trump’s final word on the matter, a Truth Social post delivered as he left for Mar-a-Lago, suggested “They should stop where they are” – a ceasefire along current battle lines, suggesting something Kyiv could very much tolerate.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to stop where we are. This is important, to stop where we are, and then to speak,” Zelensky told CNN during a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the day could have gone a lot worse for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  First, Trump extolled the deadly virtues of the Tomahawks, the supply of which he said his meeting with Zelensky was all about. “That is why we are here,” he said. “Tomahawks are very dangerous… It could mean escalation – a lot of bad things could happen.” This is a threat unimaginable when Trump first came to power: the president contentedly signaling he might give the cream of his arsenal to Zelensky so Ukraine can strike deep into Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Yet at the same time, Trump undermined his own threat, by immediately making the nature of the deal before Putin clear. “Hopefully we will be able to get this war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump added. “I think we are pretty close to that.”\n \n\n   \n  The truth is, Trump is likely still far from the deal he called “Number 9,” a reference to the number of peace agreements around the world he claims to have had a hand in. But his new approach – of threatening real military escalation, through US technology purchased by European allies and then supplied to Ukraine – might, over time, bring closer the deal he still says Putin wants.\n \n\n   \n  The threat is as psychological as it is military. The US lacks the inventory to provide the “thousands” of Tomahawks Trump said he joked with Putin on Thursday he might give Ukraine. The missiles are normally sea-launched, and so at best Ukraine would have to wait months to receive a few dozen that it would have to adapt to launch on land.\n \n\n   \n  They are remarkably expensive. Their range is not much greater than the drones Ukraine currently fires nightly deep into Russia. If it used them, Kyiv would have to hit targets worth the Tomahawk’s $2 million price tag – which means hitting serious military or government infrastructure, something Trump might veto. Trump and Zelensky appeared to have agreed to leave their arrangements ambiguous: Zelensky declined to offer any details on their Tomahawk conversation, saying the US did not want escalation. Asked if he was optimistic or pessimistic on the missiles, he replied he was “realistic.”\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Trump is now unafraid to admit Putin might be playing him – an important, if overdue, epiphany. He added: “I have been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n  The Budapest summit with Putin still lacks a concrete date, and appears another moment in which the Kremlin may seek to buy yet more time. But Putin will meet a US president perhaps wiser to his own flaws in dealing with the Kremlin head, and what is required to get Moscow’s attention. Trump has now heeded the advice of European allies: Putin most clearly responds to force.\n \n\n   \n  Whether Trump ever makes good on this threat arguably matters less in the changing dynamics of the conflict itself. Zelensky sat before Trump in a position few observers imagined possible in the spring.\n \n\n   \n  As Putin’s much-vaunted summer offensive rattles on into fall, it has singularly failed to capture any eastern town of importance. That may change in the scant remaining weeks ahead of winter in November. But the intense grind, loss and cost of the summer months has still left Pokrovsk, Kupiansk and Kostyantynivka in Ukrainian hands. Kyiv’s grip is precarious, and the Russian advances across open land and through tiny villages leave Ukraine poorly placed for winter. But Kyiv’s key positions, remarkably, for the most part, held.\n \n\n   \n  Given the crises of manpower, resources and morale looming over Ukraine in May, this is startling, and potentially flips the dynamics of the months ahead. Putin has again played his military cards, and not (yet) achieved his goals. In weeks, winter will strip the foliage bare and make it harder for Russian infantry to advance, concealed under the leaves against the threat of Kyiv’s drones.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has again defied expectations, partly due to grit and sacrifice, but also because, as Trump conceded: “They make a very good drone.” These new dynamics may yet change.\n \n\n   \n  But, for the Kremlin, pressure for results is edging towards an uncomfortable need to explain recent failures.\n \n\n   \n  Can Putin afford to fight all winter, through spring, into the fourth summer, to again aim for increasingly minimalist objectives? Gas shortages from Ukrainian strikes on oil refineries, rising inflation, vacillating sign-up payments for new military recruits, and Moscow’s consistent failure to make a real breakthrough, suggest he can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has survived a spring and summer in which Ukraine’s main ally turned on him and tried – without Kyiv - to strike a peace deal with its enemy. Ukraine has seen Europe step financially and militarily into the void left by America, and then seen the same recalcitrant White House offer them its best missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky used to be the global salesman of the case to support Ukraine’s defense and let it become a NATO member. Now he travels around NATO members, pitching to them up-to-date, fast-evolving Ukrainian drone technology.\n \n\n   \n  Recent changes are less comforting for Putin. Yes, China still has his back, but India is surely paying a price from the US secondary sanctions imposed over its purchases of Russian oil. (Trump suggested India had decided to stop buying Russian oil on Friday, which  much reporting  suggests isn’t the case).\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s plan, and support base, depends upon a military win. Putin has yet to achieve that. He may do – remarkably – in the weeks ahead, given late October’s propensity to bring sweeping battlefield change in this war.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the capability of Russia’s closed, autocratic society to suppress dissent, one question is becoming loudest for Putin: “What is your next move?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-04:00","title":"Lindsey Halligan fires more prosecutors in key US attorney’s office","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lindsey Halligan, a Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has fired senior prosecutors Beth Yusi and Kristin Bird, citing allegations of unauthorized leaks to the press.

expelled from the ruling Communist Party and the military on corruption charges, the country’s defense ministry said on Friday, the most senior officers to be purged in an anti-graft drive that began in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  He Weidong, China’s number two general, and navy admiral Miao Hua, the Chinese military’s former top political officer, are the latest senior military officials to be targeted in a campaign against corruption in the People’s Liberation Army.\n \n\n   \n  He’s removal is the first of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since March, but the investigation of his activities had not previously been disclosed by Chinese authorities.\n \n\n   \n    President Xi ‘cleaning house,’ says analyst\n \n\n   \n  He, Miao and seven other senior military officials named in the announcement “seriously violated Party discipline and are suspected of serious duty-related crimes involving an extremely large amount of money,” defense ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said.\n \n\n   \n  Their offenses were “of a grave nature, with extremely detrimental consequences,” the statement added, calling it a “significant achievement in the Party and military’s anti-corruption campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  The expulsion of He, 68, has implications beyond the military, as he also sat on the 24-member Politburo, the ruling Communist Party’s second-highest echelon of power.\n \n\n   \n  One of two vice-chairmen of the commission, the general is the third-most powerful commander of the People’s Liberation Army and has been considered a close associate of President Xi Jinping, the army’s commander-in-chief.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement came just days before the Communist Party’s Central Committee, an elite body of 200-plus senior officials, is due to hold its Fourth Plenum in Beijing. More personnel decisions, such as the expulsion and replacement of Central Committee members, are expected to be formalized at the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “Xi is cleaning house for sure. The formal removal of He and Miao means he will get to appoint new members of the Central Military Commission - which has been virtually half empty since March - at the Plenum,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.\n \n\n   \n  Miao was previously removed from the Central Military Commission in June after being put under investigation for “serious violations of discipline” last November.\n \n\n   \n  The other officials named include He Hongjun, a former senior official at the PLA Political Work Department, Wang Xiubin of the Central Military Commission’s Joint Operations Command Centre, former Eastern Theatre Command commander Lin Xiangyang, and two former political commissars of the PLA Army and Navy.

 8:12 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with protesters,  Chicago  is being cemented as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of developments in the last 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Now – with the city heading into its first weekend since a fence outside the Broadview immigration enforcement facility has come down, and with the director of   Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s   Chicago field office ordered to appear in court Monday – the stage is set for a reckoning on crowd-control measures.\n \n\n   \n  Several developments on Thursday put the Windy City under the national spotlight, including a federal appeals court upholding a lower court’s ruling temporarily denying the federal government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois and a judge separately  demanding answers  on violent encounters with protesters in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions have flared as  federal agents were deployed  across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building in Broadview, outside Chicago, has been the site of multiple confrontations as protesters have come out to decry the immigration arrests. Meanwhile,  DHS  has said it “won’t let this violence deter us from arresting the worst of the worst and making Illinois safe again.”\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  A small group of protesters that remained outside the facility Friday evening were ordered by authorities to disperse at 6 p.m. per a  curfew  put in place earlier this month by Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.\n \n\n   \n  It came a day after 13 people were arrested in a federal raid at a Chicago flea market, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday. Those arrested are “illegal aliens with criminal histories including DUI, battery causing bodily harm, and domestic violence,” the department said in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a roundup of what has transpired in the Windy City area ahead of more planned anti-ICE protests on Friday and a  second ‘No Kings’  rally and march planned for Saturday, with more than 75,000 expected to attend.\n \n\n   \n    Federal judge orders use of body cameras\n \n\n   \n  One week after issuing a  sweeping order  trying to quell the intense response of federal agents to protests against immigration enforcement activities in Chicago, US District Judge Sara Ellis told attorneys on both sides of the case to come back to her courtroom to have their own discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she had “serious concerns” about her order being followed and eventually announced she will be expanding her restraining order and will require all federal agents involved in the immigration crackdown in Chicago to have body cameras on when encountering protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but agreed to some flexibility after an attorney representing the Trump administration said it would be logistically impossible to immediately provide all agents with the cameras.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body camera order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic US Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin on Friday called on ICE and Customs and Border Protection to enforce body camera requirements in compliance with the federal order, saying the footage “plays a vital role in promoting responsible law enforcement tactics and verifying DHS accounts against facts on the ground and, ultimately, is in the best interest of agents, officials and individuals involved in use of force incidents.”\n \n\n   \n    Order bars ICE from county property\n \n\n   \n  An  executive order , signed Thursday by the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, prohibits ICE from using county-owned “property, resources, and personnel for civil immigration enforcement activities,” including staging for and debriefing from enforcement actions.\n \n\n   \n  The new order builds on prior resolutions and a 2011 county ordinance that prohibits the use of county facilities and personnel time for ICE investigations without a criminal warrant.\n \n\n   \n  “Local law enforcement and County employees rely on public trust to effectively serve residents. Allowing federal civil immigration operations on County property would erode that trust, discourage cooperation with public safety agencies, and jeopardize the sense of security that all residents deserve,” a  release  from the county about the order said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to ICE for comment.\n \n\n   \n    Federal vehicle moved more than 1,000 miles away\n \n\n   \n  The federal vehicle that American citizen  Marimar Martinez  is accused of ramming earlier this month before she was shot by a CBP agent has been  moved  more than 1,000 miles away to Maine, a Department of Justice attorney said at a Thursday hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney accused the DOJ of moving the vehicle – key evidence in the case – despite knowing he would likely need to examine it.\n \n\n   \n  The judge in the case ordered the vehicle be returned via flatbed truck after Martinez’s attorney expressed concern that evidence would not be preserved after it was driven to Maine and back.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, 30, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of assaulting, resisting and impeding officers.\n \n\n   \n  She is accused of ramming the federal law enforcement vehicle with her car on October 4 as protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown took place in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorney has disputed this, saying unreleased body camera footage shows it was a federal agent who swerved into Martinez.\n \n\n   \n    ICE arrests police officer\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, ICE agents arrested a police officer in the Chicago suburb of Hanover Park, alleging he is an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said the officer, Radule Bojovic, overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Bojovic was “encountered during a targeted enforcement action as part of Operation Midway Blitz,” the department said.\n \n\n   \n  “Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years – what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns? It’s a felony for aliens to even possess a firearm. A law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Hanover Park Police for comment and has attempted to contact Bojovic.\n \n\n   \n    Appeals court denies effort to deploy National Guard troops\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said at the time, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n  The denial is the latest in a court saga over whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority by deploying troops to quell demonstrations outside ICE facilities near Democratic-led cities like Chicago.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/trump-momentum-gaza-ukraine-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"Trump seeks to build on momentum from Gaza deal in a busy diplomatic week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is leveraging momentum from his successful brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza to pursue high-stakes diplomatic initiatives, including face-to-face meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

We got to get that one done,” Trump said while musing about a new Iran nuclear deal. “If you don’t mind, Steve, let’s focus on Russia first.”\n \n\n   \n  Energized by success in the Middle East, Trump is eager to harness that most elusive ingredient in politics and diplomacy: momentum. A week that began with a 36-hour trip to the Middle East ended with Ukraine’s president in the White House, trying to convince Trump to approve  new long-range missiles  before a surprise meeting soon with  Vladimir Putin in Budapest .\n \n\n   \n  In between, Trump confirmed he’d  authorized the CIA  to operate covertly in Venezuela while threatening to strike inside the country. He threw his endorsement — and a  $20 billion lifeline  from the US Treasury — behind Argentina’s likeminded leader. And he zigzagged through  new China tariff threats  ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Xi Jinping in a few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we carry a lot of momentum, a lot of credibility. Getting Middle East done was very important,” Trump said Friday over lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Cabinet Room. “Nobody thought it could be done. That was one nobody thought could be done, and we got it done.”\n \n\n   \n  “We had to set the table properly,” he added later. “This should be one that we get done, and I think the table is set properly here now, too, and it’ll be a great honor to get it done.”\n \n\n   \n  Translating his ability to quell the Mideast war into successes elsewhere will be a tall order for the president. And there have already been stumbling blocks in the delicate truce with Hamas, including the militant group’s inability this week to produce the remains of  more than a dozen deceased hostages  and subsequent outrage in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The leverage Trump successfully employed on Israel to stop the war doesn’t exist with Russia and China, both nuclear powers who aren’t dependent on the United States for military or financial support. Many senior US and European officials said this week they doubted Trump’s success in the Middle East would lead to any immediate shift in strategy by Moscow or Beijing. And Trump faces political peril with his interventions in Latin America, where US troops and dollars have a mixed history of either propping up or taking down regimes.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile victory\n \n\n   \n  Still, Trump’s experience with Gaza was a reminder that long stretches of arduous, often fruitless effort can eventually result in a victory, however fragile. As the US diplomat George Mitchell liked to say after brokering the Good Friday agreement to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, “We had 700 days of failure and one day of success.”\n \n\n   \n  That quote was batted around frequently by aides to President Joe Biden last year as they worked to achieve what Trump eventually did: an agreement to release all the remaining hostages in Gaza while stopping the two-year war. A week after Trump declared the deal done, it appeared to be holding, despite accusations from Israel that Hamas was not maintaining its pledge to return all the hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  American officials were quick to explain it would have been nearly impossible for Hamas to quickly locate and extract the bodies from the piles of rubble and debris left behind from the war. One US adviser pointed out the Palestinian enclave lacks any heavy equipment, like bulldozers, to clear out the wreckage. And they emphasized the unquestionable diplomatic success of getting 20 living hostages released.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the understanding we had with them was we get all the live hostage hostages out, which they did honor that,” one US adviser said.\n \n\n   \n  The task of preventing the deal from falling apart has fallen mainly to Witkoff and  Jared Kushner , Trump’s son-in-law, each of whom helped convince Israel and Hamas, via its Arab interlocutors, to agree. In conversations with Israeli officials, they have tried to emphasize the ways in which they are working to locate all the bodies, including calling in teams from Turkey with experience in earthquake recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  After returning in the middle of the night from the region this week, the president himself spoke again on Thursday with Netanyahu about the issue of the hostages’ remains.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to find out if they behave,” he said afterward, referring to Hamas. “If they don’t behave, we’ll take care of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Few believe the issue could derail the deal entirely, and American advisers were pushing ahead with the next phase of the arrangement: establishing a multinational security force and taking steps toward rebuilding Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But the issue underscored the fragility of a deal that was pushed through by Trump before many of the details were finalized. Ultimately,  far stickier questions remain , including getting Hamas to disarm, deciding who will govern Gaza and, most crucially, whether the process results in a Palestinian state.\n \n\n   \n    Carrots and sticks\n \n\n   \n  As he turns quickly to Ukraine, Trump may be drawing some lessons from his Middle East negotiations, including the virtues of working rapidly even as major details remain outstanding. This week he agreed to meet soon with Putin in Hungary in another attempt at face-to-face diplomacy, even as the parameters of a peace deal remain entirely unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Some European officials speaking privately this week said if Trump hopes to strike a similar deal to end the Ukraine war, it will require a degree of pressure on Putin — be it new sanctions or supplying new arms to Ukraine — that he so far seems unwilling to exert. Without sticks, Trump may seek to find carrots to lure Putin into a peace deal, although those, too, will be limited compared to what incentives existed with Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, in his dealings with Netanyahu, appeared highly attuned to the Israeli prime minister’s political concerns, be it the demands from his far-right coalition partners or his ongoing corruption trial on long-standing bribery and fraud charges. In a remarkable moment during his speech to the Knesset, Trump called for Israel’s president to grant Netanyahu a pardon, brushing aside the accusations the Israeli leader received lavish gifts in exchange for favors.\n \n\n   \n  “Cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?” Trump scoffed.\n \n\n   \n  Finding a political lever to pull with Putin will be more difficult. The Russian president rules as an authoritarian, without the political chores required to keep together fragile coalitions or avoiding legal mires (at least in his own country; he’s wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of trafficking Ukrainian children).\n \n\n   \n  That leaves Trump with fewer options to bring Putin to the negotiating table. For much of the last week, Trump seemed to be warming to the idea of sending Ukraine new long-range Tomahawk missiles, whose 1,000-mile range would put Moscow well within striking distance.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for Washington this week hopeful Trump was serious about providing the weapons, which he believes are necessary for turning around the battlefield momentum. He even arranged meetings with representatives from Raytheon, the US manufacturer of the Tomahawks, to discuss his weaponry needs.\n \n\n   \n  But over the course of his working lunch with Trump, it became evident the Tomahawks would not soon be on their way to Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “Hopefully they won’t need it,” Trump said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”\n \n\n   \n  The conversation between the two leaders, alongside their top aides, continued behind closed doors on Friday afternoon in what was described to CNN by several people familiar as a tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” discussion.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the long-range missiles. One official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky said afterward he’d agreed with Trump not to discuss the Tomahawks in public. And Trump, as he was flying to Palm Beach for the weekend, wrote on social media that Russia and Ukraine should end the war “where they are,” tacking back to his position from the summer that land concessions were necessary after claiming in September that Ukraine might be able to regain its lost territories.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told those around him that was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one official.\n \n\n   \n  It was the latest example of Trump inching closer to allowing new capabilities or applying new sanctions on Moscow, only to back away when Putin intervenes to head it off. In this case, it was a phone call initiated by the Kremlin a day before Zelensky arrived, meant ostensibly to congratulate Trump on his Middle East victory but which resulted in arranging another in-person meeting.\n \n\n   \n    Meetings with Putin and Xi on horizon\n \n\n   \n  If the Budapest summit materializes — Trump said he hoped it would happen in the next two weeks — it would mean back-to-back meetings with two of his top global adversaries who have, in recent years, deepened their alliance. Trump’s face-to-face summit with Xi, scheduled for the end of the month in South Korea, is intended to clarify trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  The war in Ukraine, which Beijing has helped sustain through military supplies and purchases of Russian oil, could be another point of contention. But Trump appeared confident he’d have the whole thing resolved before they sit down.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll be discussing that, but I’d love to see it ended before that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s assessments Friday that Putin “wants to end the war” were reminiscent of his confidence ahead of his August meeting with the Russian leader in Alaska, when he seemed sure the talks would result in quick progress toward a peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  They did not, and before Thursday there seemed to be little evidence that Putin was interested in moving ahead with US-brokered negotiations. Trump said he believed threat of Tomahawks could have helped bring him back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  So, too, do American officials believe that a successful negotiation in the Middle East has led Russia to rethink how it is approaching Trump and his desire to see the Ukraine war ended.\n \n\n   \n  But even Trump seemed to allow for the possibility that he could be wrong, and that Putin — as he’s feared in the past — may just be stringing him along.\n \n\n   \n  “I am,” he said when asked whether he’s concerned Putin might be playing for time. “But, you know, I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/us-navy-detaining-survivors-strike-drug-boat","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"18:41:00Z","title":"US Navy Detains Two Survivors of Strike Against Alleged Drug Boat","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Navy detained two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean, marking the first time the Trump administration has held individuals after a lethal operation.

survivors of strike against alleged drug boat \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Katie Bo Lillis, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:41 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military is holding two survivors on a Navy ship after the US carried out a Thursday strike on  an alleged drug boat  in the Caribbean, according to three US officials.\n \n\n   \n  The strike, which President Donald Trump confirmed Friday, was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. But it appeared to mark the first time an attack had not killed everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n  The detention marks the first time that the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners, and it sets up a complicated legal and policy situation for the administration. It is unclear what the US is going to do with the survivors being held, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it continues to promise further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about what happened to the survivors of the strike during an event at the White House Friday, Trump did not address the status of the detainees but said that US forces had “attacked a submarine, and that was a drug carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Just so you understand this was not an innocent group of people,” he said. “I don’t know too many people that have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug carrying loaded up submarine.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who confirmed earlier in the week that he’d  authorized the CIA to conduct covert action  in Venezuela, also had harsh language for Maduro on Friday: “He doesn’t want to fuck around with the US.”\n \n\n   \n  The threat came when Trump was asked about reports that Maduro offered preferential access to the nation’s natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature after the US conducted the series of Caribbean strikes.\n \n\n   \n  US Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region, referred CNN to the White House for comment when asked about Thursday’s strike and the survivors.\n \n\n   \n    Legality of strikes in question\n \n\n   \n  The legality of the Trump administration’s operations in the Caribbean has been widely questioned. Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been both a driver and an architect of the policy – has argued that the US has the right to “wage war” against narco-terrorists. Earlier in the year, the administration designated multiple drug cartels and gangs operating in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has also produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The detaining of the alleged drug traffickers who were not killed in the strike this week sets up another legal dilemma for the administration. It’s unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the men, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The Bush administration advanced the theory that it could rely solely on Article II for its military detention authorities, Finucane said — but the Supreme Court never ruled on the matter, leaving the question of its lawfulness unresolved. The Bush administration was ultimately able to rely on a 2001 congressional authorization that deemed the United States to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates to hold military detainees.\n \n\n   \n  The men held by the US Navy could hypothetically petition the courts to rule on the legality of their detention in what’s known as a habeas corpus claim, Finucane noted — a pathway followed by a number of detainees in the past that could reveal more information about the Trump administration’s secretive legal rationale for the strikes.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/acosta-interview-epstein-house-oversight","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"18:34:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s former labor secretary Alex Acosta defends handling of controversial Epstein plea deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Alex Acosta, the former US Attorney and Secretary of Labor under Donald Trump, defended his 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, asserting that taking the case to trial would have been legally and evidentially unworkable.

controversial Epstein plea deal \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:34 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The former US attorney who negotiated a controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein defended that agreement in a closed-door interview with House investigators last month, according to a transcript of the interview released by lawmakers.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Acosta, the former US attorney from the Southern District of Florida who later served as labor secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, disagreed with the assessment that he gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” and argued that it would have been a “crapshoot” to take the case to federal trial at the time.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with the House Oversight Committee, Acosta reflected on what he viewed as his constraints as the US attorney on the case and why he felt he did the best he could with the circumstances he was navigating.\n \n\n   \n  The interview was part of the committee’s bipartisan investigation into Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, which has included subpoenas for documents and closed-door testimony. The congressional investigation comes amid growing calls for more transparency over the case.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta  resigned  from the post of Secretary of Labor in 2019 after he faced furor over the plea deal. Epstein avoided a federal trial at the time and  served only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls .  A Miami Herald investigation published  in 2018 described the plea deal, negotiated by Acosta, as the “deal of a lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  In his testimony to Congress, Acosta said that a Washington-based attorney from the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section who reviewed the case said going to trial would be a “crapshoot” – a judgement he apparently agreed with.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the trial was a crapshoot, and we just wanted the guy to go to jail,” Acosta told the House Oversight panel.\n \n\n   \n  “If we go to trial and we roll the dice and we do the crapshoot and we lose, what kind of signal does that send? That says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important  to send that signal, and that’s why – that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea,” he later added.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta laid out why he thought the victims’ statements and issues of jurisdiction would have posed challenges to the case if it had gone to trial in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  “Every attorney that looked at the case, from the prosecuting attorney, again, through the entire chain, looked at the evidence, and there were evidentiary issues with the victims,” Acosta stated. “Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have – cross-examination would have been withering.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said investigators did not have evidence that Epstein traveled with any victims across state lines, which would have supported a federal charge, or that there were other individuals involved.\n \n\n   \n  “At the time, one of the major questions in the case was, is this a Federal case or is it a local case?” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  While Acosta acknowledged that in the political climate today, “there’s a greater desire for ‘just go for it’” among the public,” he claimed that was not the case in the early 2000s when he was making the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Myself, the prosecuting attorney, the managing attorney of the Palm Beach office, the Criminal chief, and the first assistant all favored a pre-trial resolution. It was across-the-board,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta has previously defended his handling of the plea deal, but the release of the closed-door interview transcript offers extensive insight into the former US attorney’s decision-making in the highly scrutinized, and criticized, case.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Acosta stood firm behind his actions, he acknowledged that others have had strong criticisms of his work.\n \n\n   \n  “Looking back in hindsight, there are a number of issues that I will, you know, that I will say caused the community and the victims to feel – to feel that this was not a good resolution, and I get that,” Acosta said. “But from the perspective of our prosecutors at the time, based on the evidence we had at the time, you know, everyone in our office wanted to put him in jail, and that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta placed blame on his state counterparts for allowing Epstein to participate in a work release program that enabled him to be outside of the jail during the business day.\n \n\n   \n  “The work release was granted by the Palm Beach sheriff. Our office opposed it. Our office had every expectation that he would have continuous confinement. We were upset – more than upset. We were – what’s the polite word for ticked off? I’ll say ticked off. We were ticked off that he didn’t do so,” Acosta testified.\n \n\n   \n  “When we found out about it we objected. We objected in writing. We objected fully,” Acosta detailed.\n \n\n   \n    Acosta says it was ‘entirely’ his choice to resign as labor secretary amid Epstein furor\n \n\n   \n  Acosta repeatedly said he did not know if Trump was interviewed as part of his case and said the decision of who was interviewed was not up to him.\n \n\n   \n  “Not to my knowledge,” Acosta said when pressed by investigators. “It would not have been my practice to get involved in who was and who wasn’t interviewed.” He added he had no recollection of ever seeing documents where Trump’s name surfaced during the investigation into Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta said he never spoke to Trump until he was under consideration to be his Labor Secretary. Acosta said there were only two times the Epstein matter could have come up in discussion with Trump or anyone in his administration, but was not certain or specific on the details.\n \n\n   \n  The first was during his vetting process.\n \n\n   \n  “I may have had a communication – I don’t recall if I did or if it was simply – or if there was some written question or otherwise. But at some point in the vetting process, a question may have arisen,” Acosta said. “I honestly don’t remember.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta also said he had a conversation with Trump’s then- communications team, but did not give an exact date and was vague on specifics. I know in The Washington Post there was a story above the fold at one point,” he said, “And so I talked to the communications team, because the communications team needed to be briefed.”\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was also asked about rumors that Epstein had ties to the intelligence community., He said during the investigation no one from the intelligence community reached out to the office about Epstein and that he had no reason to believe Epstein was an asset to a foreign or domestic intelligence agency. “If there was any secure information, procedures would have been triggered that were never triggered,” Acosta said.\n \n\n   \n  On his eventual decision to resign in 2019, Acosta said, “I was neither instructed to resign, it wasn’t suggested that I resign. It was entirely my choice, my decision.”\n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Acosta was shown at least two news articles that connected Trump to Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  One was a New York Magazine  article  from 2002 prior to Acosta’s term as US attorney, where Trump is quoted saying he knows Epstein for 15 years and calls him a “terrific guy.”\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,” Trump is quoted saying the 2002 article.\n \n\n   \n  The second article Acosta was shown was from  October 2007 - - after Acosta’s office had executed the non-prosecution agreement but before Epstein had plead guilty—that alleged Epstein would try and “procure girls” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and was banned as a result.\n \n\n   \n  Acosta was then asked if he is aware if Trump was interviewed about women at Mar-a-Lago.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not aware of who was interviewed and not interviewed in the case generally because U.S. attorneys do not become involved in deciding who gets interviewed and who does not get interviewed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/presidential-profanity-trump-biden","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:39:00-04:00","title":"When the White House gets salty: Trump, Biden and presidential profanity","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the use of profanity by high-ranking U.S. political figures, particularly Donald Trump, who used the 'f-bomb' during a White House meeting with Ukraine's leader and criticized Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro with a reference to 'fucking around.'

Trump’s frustrations with Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro spilled into public view during a White House meeting with Ukraine’s leader Friday, which saw Trump trade  military strikes  in the Caribbean for an f-bomb in the Cabinet Room.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on reporting from  The New York Times  that Venezuela had approached administration officials with a proposal to offer preferential access to its natural resources in exchange for lowering the temperature between the two nations, Trump told reporters Maduro has “offered everything.”\n \n\n   \n  “You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue language at the White House is rare, but it’s not the first time Trump has deployed that specific expletive to vent his annoyance over diplomatic challenges\n \n\n   \n  In June, following the news Israel and Iran violated a temporary ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long, and so hard, that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shrugged off many norms as president, and often used coarse or politically incorrect language, both as president and as a presidential candidate — in 2018,  he decried immigrants coming to the US from what he called “shithole countries ,” behind closed doors, later using the same curse to describe the District of Columbia  during a 2024 campaign rally in Iowa .\n \n\n   \n  But he’s hardly the first prominent politician to deploy the f-word or other expletives from their off-color arsenal in public.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, raised eyebrows when, during a 2010 press conference with then-President Barack Obama, he was caught telling Obama passage of the Affordable Care Act was a “big fucking deal.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats  later used the gaffe to raise money for the Democratic National Committee .\n \n\n   \n  Later, as president, Biden  was again caught on a hot mic  calling a reporter in the White House press pool “a stupid son of a bitch,” for asking a question he didn’t like, though he later called the reporter to apologize.\n \n\n   \n  Obama too raised eyebrows when, during an off-the-record portion of a 2009 interview with CNBC, he called rapper Kanye West “a jackass” after West rushed the MTV stage during Taylor Swift’s speech accepting the award for best female music video of the year.\n \n\n   \n  And in 2004, then-Vice President Dick Cheney  told Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy to “go fuck yourself”  on the Senate floor during Senate picture day after Leahy accused the vice president of war profiteering.\n \n\n   \n  Using profanity on the Senate floor is against the chamber’s rules, but Cheney skirted a violation because the Senate was not in session, a Senate official told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/business/salesforce-marc-benioff-apology","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:39:00Z","title":"Marc Benioff apologizes for suggesting National Guard be sent to San Francisco","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, initially suggested that President Donald Trump deploy the National Guard to San Francisco to address safety concerns during the company’s Dreamforce conference, sparking backlash from critics including venture capitalist Ron Conway, who resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hubris courses through what President Donald Trump and his administration are doing right now. So much of it is unpopular and politically fraught. They’re charging ahead regardless.\n \n\n   \n  That’s true of the tariffs. It’s true of the growing militarization of the homeland. And it’s been true of his cuts to the government and  many other things .\n \n\n   \n  But perhaps nothing is as politically fraught right now as what’s happening off the coast of South America.\n \n\n   \n  There are growing signs that Trump is  flirting with regime change or even attacking Venezuela . And to the extent it’s more than a bluff, it’s not difficult to see the situation blowing up in the administration’s face.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf today runs through the increased saber-rattling and  signs of a building clash . The US Navy has built up in the Caribbean, and the Air Force flew B-52 bombers off the Venezuelan coast for hours on Wednesday. The Trump administration is striking alleged drug boats  in quite possibly illegal ways . Trump has both left open the possibility of strikes inside Venezuela and confirmed Wednesday that he has  authorized covert CIA action there .\n \n\n   \n  We also learned Thursday that the admiral overseeing this US Southern Command region, Adm. Alvin Holsey, has  suddenly announced his retirement . CNN reports this came amid tensions over the administration’s activities, though the Pentagon denied this.\n \n\n   \n  There are a couple ways to read all this.\n \n\n   \n  One is that this is part of a trademark Trump pressure campaign to get Venezuela to bend to his will. Perhaps the threat will be enough to get Trump what he wants.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a different side of Trump in his second term –  an increasingly militaristic one . He seems to have shed the non-interventionist political veneer that characterized his campaigns for office in favor of a more heavy-handed approach on the world stage. And that would fit with his broader project, which appears to be largely about showing how powerful he can be.\n \n\n   \n  And even if his saber-rattling is all intended as a bluff, at some point it’s conceivable that the president could be forced to follow through.\n \n\n   \n  If it comes to that, it’s difficult to see how Trump would have the American people behind him.\n \n\n   \n  While we don’t have good quality polling on the Venezuela situation specifically, other recent surveys have shown Americans taking a dim view of such foreign adventurism.\n \n\n   \n  A  poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  last year showed the percentage of Americans who favored an active role in world affairs hitting its lowest point since 1982.\n \n\n   \n  Just 17% of Americans agreed that the US had a “responsibility” to take a leading role in world affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  in June showed Americans agreed 58%-38% that it’s better if the US “stays out of the affairs of other nations.” Majorities of Republicans, independents and Democrats agreed with that sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  Americans have been willing to take active roles in certain foreign conflicts. But that quickly changes when it includes the prospect of conflict involving US troops and regime change, according to several surveys taken around the time of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Iran is, of course, not Venezuela. You could certainly argue that going to war with Iran would be a far riskier proposition.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s a threat that Americans have been quite concerned about for years and decades. But there is no evidence that Americans feel similarly about Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the case that Venezuela has sent drugs and gangs to invade the United States, but so many of these claims have proven hyperbolic – and  even been rejected by judges  and  his own intelligence community .\n \n\n   \n  It’s conceivable that Americans could be convinced that going into Venezuela is necessary to combat the flow of drugs.

On Thursday, the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals let stand an order temporarily blocking that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Trump filed the appeal at the Supreme Court in a case involving his effort to deploy the guard to Chicago. In the appeal, the administration said that lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The litigation puts the controversy before a Supreme Court that has rarely ruled on such deployments – but that has often deferred to the president on matters of security and defining what  constitutes a national emergency . The administration asked for a quick order that would allow them to carry out the deployment while the high court considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  In the appeal, the Trump administration argues lower courts were impermissibly encroaching on the president’s authority to control federalized guard members.\n \n\n   \n  The   lower court order temporarily blocking the deployment, the administration said, put the judicial branch “in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the president’s commander-in-chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the president can deploy.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting that federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  “Federal agents are forced to desperately scramble to protect themselves and federal property, allocating resources away from their law-enforcement mission to conduct protective operations instead,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.\n \n\n   \n  That framing starts in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as a “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court balked at Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  In the administration’s appeal on Friday, Sauer said that case “squarely controls” Trump’s current deployments.\n \n\n   \n   Based on that, the Trump administration has argued, federal courts may not even review a president’s decisions to call up the guard.\n \n\n   \n  But the states challenging those decisions have scoffed at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army. And they have pointed to a 1932 decision, Sterling v. Constantin, in which courts reviewed a former Texas governor’s decision to deploy the National Guard to shut down certain oil fields in the state in order to limit production. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could review such deployment decisions that fell beyond a “range of honest judgment.”\n \n\n   \n  Just how fast the Supreme Court will move in the case was not immediately clear, but the court requested a response from state and local officials by Monday evening – a faster than usual turnaround.\n \n\n   \n  The 6-3 conservative court has sided with Trump in the vast majority of emergency cases he has filed since returning to power in January.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/media/smartmatic-doj-fox-giuliani-bribery-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Smartmatic Indicted in Foreign Bribery Case, Possibly Endangering Its Lawsuits Against Fox News and Giuliani","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Smartmatic, a voting technology company, is facing foreign bribery charges from the U.S. Department of Justice over alleged payments to a top Philippine election official to secure contracts for the 2016 elections.

       5:32 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department on Thursday filed foreign bribery charges against Smartmatic, the voting technology company that is suing Fox News and other prominent pro-Trump figures for defamation over their promotion of 2020 election lies.\n \n\n   \n  The bribery and money laundering charges against Smartmatic arose from  an existing case  filed last year against some of its current and former executives, including its founder.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment relates to an alleged $1 million bribe paid to the top election official in the Philippines to secure lucrative contracts for that country’s 2016 elections. The indictment doesn’t include any allegations of voter fraud or election-rigging against Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  The news could be catastrophic for Smartmatic, potentially weakening its hand in pending 2020 election-related defamation lawsuits against Fox News, the Fox News host turned US attorney  Jeanine Pirro , ex-Trump lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  and MyPillow CEO  Mike Lindell .\n \n\n   \n  The charges could undermine Smartmatic’s arguments that its reputation has been damaged solely by these pro-Trump figures and their brazen lies about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more of the same. A photocopy of the previous spurious indictment,” Smartmatic said in a statement on Thursday, denying wrongdoing and vowing to fight the case.\n \n\n   \n  The company further said, “We believe the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has been misled and politically influenced by powerful interests, despite our extensive cooperation with the government. This is again, targeted, political, and unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what meddling Smartmatic is referring to. President Donald Trump has successfully pushed in recent weeks to  prosecute his opponents , but the underlying case against Smartmatic executives was brought by the Biden-era Justice Department, and career prosecutors endorsed Thursday’s new indictment, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic’s co-defendants previously pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s machines and software are widely used overseas, but in US elections, they are only used in Los Angeles. Dean Logan, the top election official for Los Angeles County, told CNN in a statement that the county owns and controls its own voting systems, but will “hold Smartmatic accountable to the terms and protections” of their ongoing contract.\n \n\n   \n  “The indictment is unrelated to the County’s administration of elections or the integrity of Los Angeles County’s voting systems, and the County’s contracts with Smartmatic were validated to ensure that all work was performed and requirements met,” Logan said. “Further, the County’s engagements with Smartmatic are fixed fee contracts with specific protection from the types of add-on fees and price inflation alleged in the activities cited in the indictment.”\n \n\n   \n    The defamation cases\n \n\n   \n  After President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies  spread the false claim  that Smartmatic technology flipped millions of votes to rob him of a victory.\n \n\n   \n  Smartmatic filed defamation lawsuits in 2021 against these figures, and other right-wing media outlets, seeking billions of dollars in damages. The company  settled with Newsmax  last year for $40 million and  settled with One America News  for an undisclosed amount.\n \n\n   \n  All of these pro-Trump outlets and figures deny wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines scandal — which  CNN first revealed  in 2023 — has  provided a major boost  to these pro-Trump figures facing defamation lawsuits. They have sought additional documents about the criminal probe, hoping these will weaken damages claims from Smartmatic, and they’ve argued that the indictment proves Smartmatic’s shady practices.\n \n\n   \n  “Smartmatic was and is a failing company: its continued cozy relationship with dictators, a decade of mismanagement and poor performance, and criminal bribery charges against its highest echelon of leaders,” Fox News wrote in a court filing earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Kate Mangels, a Los Angeles-based defense attorney who has handled defamation cases, said the indictment “severely limits” Smartmatic’s ability to claim it’s still suffering from ongoing damages from the 2020-era lies about its supposed vote-rigging.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendants in the defamation lawsuits will likely argue that, to the extent Smartmatic’s reputation has been harmed, it is impossible to tease out what harm came from the alleged defamation and what harm came from the indictment,” Mangels said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment could also influence settlement negotiations, Mangels said, because “at trial, it would be difficult for Smartmatic to establish that all the damages” stem from the allegedly defamatory broadcasts and statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/deadly-michigan-plane-crash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00Z","title":"Deadly plane crash in Michigan mirrors similar business jet crash last year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A private Hawker 800XP business jet, registered XA-JMR, crashed near Lansing, Michigan, during a test flight following scheduled maintenance by Duncan Aviation.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administration’s CMS official, quickly clarified that the price reduction was not finalized and was still under negotiation. The announcement sparked significant investor reaction, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly stock prices dropping 4% in after-hours trading. While patients and doctors expressed strong hope, experts caution that the $150 price remains uncertain and may not be achievable in the near term. Current access is limited by high costs, leading many to rely on unregulated compounded versions, which carry safety risks. Experts emphasize that even if prices drop, financial barriers may persist, and more detailed policy frameworks are needed before such a change becomes real.

Oz cautions it’s not a done deal, but patients and doctors say it could be a gamechanger \n       \n  By Meg Tirrell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Janet McCaskill was on vacation in Arizona with her husband and best friend when she heard that President Donald Trump had suggested he might be able to bring the cost of popular weight-loss drugs down to $150 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “The thought of it going to $150 a month is dramatic,” said McCaskill, a grandmother from North Carolina  who’s lost 100 pounds  with the help of GLP-1 medicines, a class best known for the diabetes drug Ozempic. “That is most fantastic – if it comes to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump planted the idea Thursday in an Oval Office news conference about an entirely different set of drugs – those for  in vitro fertilization  – before his Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz, stepped in to warn it wasn’t a done deal.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump’s comments made waves. Patients who’ve struggled to afford the pricey medicines shared hope the price could be reached. Doctors called it “huge for patients,” if true. And in a sign that Wall Street took it seriously, stocks of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the makers of GLP-1 drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, fell significantly, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in the companies’ market values.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just not clear it’ll actually happen.\n \n\n   \n    An awkward moment in the Oval\n \n\n   \n  It started with a familiar refrain from the president,  who’s previously lamented  the cost difference of weight-loss drugs in Europe compared with the US.\n \n\n   \n  “In London, you’d buy a certain drug for $130 … and in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,” Trump said in opening remarks of his IVF announcement Thursday. “So now we’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150.”\n \n\n   \n  A reporter, Max Bayer of Endpoints News, made the connection, asking later if Trump was referring to bringing weight-loss drugs down to $150. The president confirmed he was “referring to Ozempic, or the fat-loss drug … they’ll be much lower.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, Dr. Oz started to look uncomfortable, stepping up to the podium with a subtle shaking of his head.\n \n\n   \n  “We have not negotiated those yet,” Oz clarified. “We’re going to be rolling these out over time.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t take long for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly’s stocks to react, each dropping about 4% in after hours trading Thursday and maintaining losses through trading on Friday. A Wall Street analyst, Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets, sought to assuage investor fears of coming price cuts in a research note Thursday evening that called Trump’s remarks “aggressive posturing amidst negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The drug companies were tight-lipped. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and its weight-loss counterpart, Wegovy, told CNN that the company “has engaged in discussions” with the Trump administration about drug pricing in the context of the president’s Most Favored Nation executive order, an approach that dictates the US shouldn’t pay more for medicines than the lowest price offered to peer nations.\n \n\n   \n  Medicines are routinely sold at markedly higher prices in the US than other countries, including diabetes and weight-loss drugs: Ozempic is priced 10 times higher in the US than France, according to  a 2023 analysis  from Peterson-KFF.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain focused on improving patient access and affordability, and we will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need,” a Novo Nordisk spokeswoman said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesman for Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, said the company is “not aware of any specific price commitments,” and that it’s “in discussions with the administration to further expand patient access, preserve innovation and promote affordability for our medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Most Favored Nation’ drug prices\n \n\n   \n  The president has announced deals with  Pfizer ,  AstraZeneca  and  EMD Serono  in the past month under the Most Favored Nation framework, and has promised more to come. The deals so far have included an offering of medicines at Most Favored Nation prices to Medicaid – a system that already receives heavy discounts – as well as deals on certain drugs that can be purchased directly by consumers, without insurance, through a new platform called TrumpRx.\n \n\n   \n  In return, drugmakers have won reprieves from the threat of tariffs, as long as they continue to invest in manufacturing and research in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Thus far, the deals have appeared neutral or positive to pharmaceutical companies, with  Pfizer’s stock rising  the day of its announcement and buoying competitors along with it. The agreements, Seigerman wrote, “have been far from a sweeping implementation of US pricing cuts.”\n \n\n   \n  The drugs Pfizer and the White House noted  would be offered  through the TrumpRx program don’t appear to be used very often in the US, face generic competition in the near future, or carry such high list prices that even steep discounts for cash-paying patients would leave the medicines unaffordable for most people, said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 medications, though, so-called for a hormone they mimic, are used by millions of Americans, and “if you look at the barriers to using them, cost is the number one thing,” said  Dr. Louis Aronne , director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n \n\n   \n    From thousands to hundreds\n \n\n   \n  The medicines are all priced, before insurance or discounts, at about $1,000 a month or more in the US. With commercial insurance coverage, many patients pay as little as $25 out of pocket. But coverage can be thorny, especially for weight loss, and some insurers are  reducing coverage .\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill experienced that firsthand. She started using Mounjaro in late 2022 to try to lose weight, and had such strong results, she credits the medicine with saving her life. But her insurance didn’t cover it, and it was so expensive she switched to a compounded version made by a local pharmacy.\n \n\n   \n  Compounders typically make drugs that require personalization, like if a patient is allergic to a certain ingredient or needs other modifications made. But law also allows compounding when medicines are in shortage, and GLP-1 manufacturers had trouble meeting outsized demand for several years, opening up an entire market of off-brand, compounded GLP-1s.\n \n\n   \n  Though the shortages  have now ended , some purveyors still offer compounded versions of the medicines, at much lower prices than Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly – even after  the companies introduced  cash pay discounted options.\n \n\n   \n  McCaskill said she switched to a Lilly program that allowed her to buy its weight-loss drug, Zepbound,  directly at at discount  after her local compounding pharmacy stopped selling the medication. But it costs her about $500 a month. Her best friend, Kay Powell, a nurse, is also on one of the medicines, but gets a compounded version through another pharmacy she trusts for $150.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m moving back to the compound just as soon as I can get to my doctor next week,” McCaskill told CNN Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re price shopping,” Powell added. “We’re going to buy it wherever it’s most affordable.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big however’\n \n\n   \n  The White House and US Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from CNN about Trump’s $150 promise from the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  And doctors, analysts and policy researchers were skeptical they’d reach a $150 deal – or even what that might mean.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments may be “more to get these guys to make a deal than to actually get the price to $150 over the short term,” said Jared Holz, a health care strategist for financial firm Mizuho Securities USA. “Everything that comes out of this administration seems like it’s a precursor to some sort of transaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. William Feldman, a physician and health policy researcher at UCLA, pointed out Novo Nordisk is  also in negotiations  with Oz’s CMS over pricing of semaglutide – the generic name of Ozempic and Wegovy – for Medicare, under a framework laid out in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. He noted it’s not clear if a $150 monthly price would be part of those negotiations or a broader agreement outside them.\n \n\n   \n  “$150 a month gets closer to prices for semaglutide in other parts of the world and even to prices for compounded versions in the US,” he told CNN by email Friday. “This could be a boon for patients and could drive increased uptake in the US. However – and this is a big however – I’d like to see more details.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Jody Dushay, an attending physician in endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said she refers patients to both Lilly and Novo Nordisk for their self-pay options when they don’t have insurance coverage, but pointed out “for many patients $500 a month is still totally unaffordable.”\n \n\n   \n  She urges patients to steer clear of compounded products, though, “due to lack of regulation and unknown safety and efficacy.”\n \n\n   \n  If the branded versions were priced at $150 a month,  access “would greatly increase,” said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an obesity specialist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. “Even more patients would be willing and able to afford paying” for them.\n \n\n   \n  Even an out-of-pocket cost “would still pose some financial barriers,” said Dr. David Kim, an assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences at the University of Chicago. Vanderbilt’s Dusetzina pointed out “prior research has shown that once the prices reach $100 per month, many people do not fill their medicines.”\n \n\n   \n    260 pounds all together\n \n\n   \n  Affording GLP-1 medicines can make people feel desperate at their current prices and without insurance coverage, McCaskill said, especially as she’s seen not just dramatic weight loss but improvements in her cholesterol and other health markers.\n \n\n   \n  “Between the three of us, we’ve probably lost – what – 260 pounds?” Powell added, including McCaskill’s husband, Barry, in the tally.\n \n\n   \n  They all said they’d switch to the branded versions, away from the compounded ones, if they were offered at comparable prices.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the real thing,” Barry said. “No question.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misspelled Bayer’s last name.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/des-moines-superintendent-ian-roberts-indicted","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00-05:00","title":"Iowa Superintendent Detained by ICE Falsely Claimed He Was a US Citizen, Indictment Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ian Roberts, a former superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on an I-9 form and for unlawfully possessing firearms while an illegal alien.

quiet, yearslong investigation into John Bolton \n       \n  By Jeremy Herb, Katelyn  Polantz, Kristen Holmes, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  By the time FBI Director Kash Patel took office in February, the investigation into whether John Bolton mishandled classified information had been in the works for roughly three years.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump had long been calling for Bolton – and other perceived political enemies – to be prosecuted, and the Maryland US Attorney’s office had been quietly building a case that started during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  When Patel was briefed on Bolton and other sensitive investigations shortly after landing at the bureau, he was surprised at the amount of evidence gathered.\n \n\n   \n  “Why isn’t this m*therf**ker ​ in jail yet?” Patel said after being briefed, sources familiar with the exchange told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019, is now the third Trump critic to be indicted in the past month after the president implored Attorney General Pam Bondi in a  social media post  he thought was a private message: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.”\n \n\n   \n  Within days of that message urging Bondi to act, Comey  was indicted on charges  of lying to Congress. Soon after, New York Attorney General Letitia James was charged with bank fraud related to a mortgage  in an indictment unveiled  last week. But while Trump called in his post specifically for the prosecutions of Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, he never mentioned Bolton in his missive.\n \n\n   \n  The cases against Comey and James were presented to a grand jury by Lindsey Halligan, an interim US attorney handpicked by Trump for the position after the previous US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was forced out amid pressure to bring the cases.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer who had no previous prosecutorial experience, was the only prosecutor to sign both indictments.\n \n\n   \n  In contrast, six prosecutors, including US Attorney for Maryland Kelly Hayes and the current head of counterintelligence investigations at the Justice Department, Scott Lara, signed the 26-page indictment against Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  In it, prosecutors accused Bolton of sharing “more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities” through his personal email account with two unauthorized individuals, who CNN has reported are his wife and daughter.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against Comey and James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said. That hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly attacking Bolton and possibly causing damage to the case, some Justice officials fear.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has railed for years against Bolton over his 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president, claiming he should have gone to jail because classified information was contained in the book. Trump’s first Justice Department opened criminal and civil investigations into the book in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said Thursday when told Bolton had been indicted, adding that he had not reviewed the case.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton made his initial court appearance in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Friday morning, pleading not guilty to all 18 counts. He said in a statement Thursday that he was a victim of Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” Bolton said. “I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Good luck, Mr. Mustache!’\n \n\n   \n  In June 2021, the Justice Department  closed its year-old criminal investigation  that scrutinized whether Bolton’s 2020 book had illegally revealed national security information.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, an Iranian hack of Bolton’s AOL email account would set in motion a new probe that led to Thursday’s charges.\n \n\n   \n  On July 6, 2021, a Bolton representative notified the FBI that he was the victim of an email breach by suspected Iranian hackers.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have been laboring on this case since then after the FBI began assessing potential damage from the hack and raised questions about whether Bolton’s practice of sending diary entries from his personal email broke the law, according to people briefed on the probe.\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian hacking campaign targeting Bolton and other former government officials included threats against Bolton to expose him and cause him problems of the kind that crippled Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  “Good luck Mr. Mustache!” one message sent in August 2021 said, according to a person who described investigative documents.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI and national security lawyers in Maryland, and at Justice Department headquarters, formally opened an investigation into the hack in 2022, sources said. Early in the probe, prosecutors on the investigation got warrants to receive the data from service companies that hosted relevant accounts, such as Yahoo for Bolton’s AOL account and Google for another account, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  The work building a case was slow and meticulous. Information returned to the prosecutors needed to be reviewed by both the intelligence community, which was sensitive to classified information, and processed through a filter team at the Justice Department that would pull out confidential attorney-client records, because Bolton was a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  For years, the work around what Bolton had and shared in his email account was an investigation essentially walled off from the one related to his book, which had been run by the US Attorney’s office in the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  By the time investigators were ready to obtain a search warrant in August, the book manuscript had once again become part of the case. It was part – along with the hack – of what prosecutors pointed to in court as a basis for searching his office and home, according to court filings.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to search Bolton’s office and especially his home were crucial in the final turn of the investigation before the indictment this week.\n \n\n   \n  While investigators spent months assembling an idea of the emails and classified records they would want to use to build the case, Bolton’s home contained printed copies of some of the emails, the indictment said. Investigators had long suspected they would find hard copies like those, sources told CNN, because some of the emails Bolton wrote to his family he noted were for “the Archives.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s really treasonous’\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly attacked Bolton since the release of his 2020 book and as Bolton has become one of the more prominent ex-Trump staffers turned critic of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton was named Trump’s third national security adviser in 2018, a position that marked the culmination of a lengthy career in Washington across multiple administrations, including as George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  The initial Justice Department criminal probe of Bolton began in 2020 with an investigation into whether his he violated the law by including information the administration said was classified in his memoir. The same year, the Trump administration sued in civil court to try to stop publication of Bolton’s book over a dispute of whether he got proper sign off from classification authorities.\n \n\n   \n   Bolton’s memoir  included shocking allegations about the inner workings of the Trump White House, including that Trump requested Chinese help to win the 2020 election, argued Venezuela was part of the US and offered to help Turkey’s leader avoid a Justice Department probe.\n \n\n   \n  Trump publicly called for Bolton to be prosecuted in 2020 over the book’s publication, saying in  an interview  that his former national security advisor released “massive amounts” of classified information in its pages.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really treasonous what he did,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  On X, then called  Twitter , Trump called Bolton “a lowlife who should be in jail.”\n \n\n   \n  This year, Trump hasn’t frequently commented this year on the Bolton probe – a stark contrast from his public pressure campaigns for the prosecutions of other political foes who were key figures in investigations into himself.\n \n\n   \n  But since the search of Bolton’s house and office in August, Trump has asked advisers about the status of the case. He had been assured in recent weeks that they were moving ahead and that it was a strong case, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Stay tuned’\n \n\n   \n  In late August, when FBI agents executed a search warrants on Bolton’s home and office, they  seized electronics and multiple documents  labeled “secret,” “confidential,” and “classified,” including some about weapons of mass destruction, according to court records filed by prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Bondi, Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino all posted statements on X the morning of the search,  breaking department norms  of not commenting on ongoing investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “Public corruption will not be tolerated,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino  wrote .\n \n\n   \n  After the search, Bolton’s attorney Abbe Lowell said that the records Bolton kept would have been typical of those kept by a long-time government official. In a statement Thursday, Lowell said that the records were unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, were known to the FBI and were “personal diaries.”\n \n\n   \n  The next month, senior Justice Department leaders, including an attorney from the deputy attorney general’s office, were  pressing for the US Attorney’s office  to charge Bolton in the days after Trump complained that prosecutions of his enemies weren’t moving quickly enough.\n \n\n   \n  But prosecutors in the Maryland US attorney’s office pushed back, arguing the timeline was too aggressive and they needed more time to bring a stronger case against Bolton, including reviewing the records obtained from the search warrant.\n \n\n   \n  One Justice Department official was considering pulling prosecutors off the case out of opposition to the deputy attorney general’s instruction.\n \n\n   \n  In the end, though, the political pressure eased on the Maryland office after Comey’s indictment. Career prosecutors on the case withdrew their reservations on timing and set in motion  finalizing the indictment  last weekend.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the lead prosecutor in Bolton’s case, Thomas Sullivan – who also worked on the Biden classified documents investigation under special counsel Robert Hur – presented to a federal grand jury for a little over two hours at the federal courthouse about 20 minutes outside DC.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen minutes after members of the grand jury filed out of the courthouse, Sullivan, four of his colleagues and the jury foreperson took an elevator one floor up to Magistrate Judge Gina Simms’ courtroom to deliver the indictments approved that day. After the foreperson handed up the indictments, the judge asked if there were any other matters she needed addressed, to which Sullivan said yes.\n \n\n   \n  He handed the judge a slim red file, but and said nothing else. Simms then quickly reviewed the file – also not saying aloud any details of it – before adjourning. The entire proceeding lasted less than 10 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the courtroom, Sullivan said few words to reporters seeking information about what he gave the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “I would just stay posted,” he said. “Stay tuned.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/no-kings-protests-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"16:06:00Z","title":"Another nationwide day of protest is set for this weekend.

Here’s what we know about ‘No Kings’ 2 \n       \n  By Lauren Mascarenhas, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:06 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald  Trump arrived at his military parade  in Washington, DC, this June to a 21-gun salute and members of the crowd singing “Happy Birthday,” about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest his administration. Now, amid an ongoing government shutdown and Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops to American cities, millions are gearing up for round two.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,500 demonstrations – about 450 more than were planned in June – across all 50 states are slated for Saturday in the second round of “ No Kings ” protests, which aim to broadly reject what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican leaders have labeled the protests as anti-American. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed, without evidence, that Saturday’s planned rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the first round of “No Kings” protests took place, Trump had just barreled through the first five months of his second term with  hundreds of executive orders  and other moves targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, student protesters, federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and more.\n \n\n   \n  Tension over immigration raids reached a fever pitch with protests in Los Angeles, where Trump  federalized the California National Guard  against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom – a move that experts warned was an  unprecedented and dangerous escalation  of presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the administration has only “doubled down,” protest organizers say.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents, under pressure to meet the administration’s  arrest quotas , have performed raids throughout the country, sometimes met with fervent protests by community members. Trump has called on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, former FBI director  James Comey  and Attorney General of New York  Letitia James . The administration has challenged unflattering media coverage, resulting in a  defamation lawsuit  against The New York Times and the suspension (and eventual return) of “ Jimmy Kimmel Live! ”\n \n\n   \n  And the administration has escalated its  attempted deployment of federal troops  into Democratic-led cities, like DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state leaders have pushed back against the National Guard deployments, and legal battles are still playing out in court.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republican politicians have branded the upcoming protests as “Hate America” rallies. GOP Sen. Roger Marshall alleged “professional protesters” and “agitators” will show up, and Johnson suggested participants would be “pro-Hamas” and “Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  But organizers are planning for peaceful demonstrations aimed at providing a clear contrast to the administration’s recent show of force.\n \n\n   \n    Could the protests prompt more military force?\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll have to get the National Guard out,” Marshall recently said about Saturday’s protests. “Hopefully it’ll be peaceful. I doubt it.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the possibility of National Guard deployment to Saturday’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday directed the state’s National Guard to deploy troops to Austin ahead of a planned protest his office characterized as being “antifa-linked.”\n \n\n   \n  Texas Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\n \n\n   \n  “Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do — and Greg Abbott just proved he’s one of them,” Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Indivisible Project, the nonprofit organizing the protest, has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation, and organizers are working directly with cities that have   a National Guard presence to make sure they are prepared, its co-executive director, Leah Greenberg, said.\n \n\n   \n  In other areas, organizers have been working to educate protesters on their rights, in the event troops show up somewhere unexpected.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said Thursday at a meeting of protest organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights,” Greenberg told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already planned another celebratory military show of force in California set to take place on the same day of the protests,  Newsom  noted Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers hope to build on the momentum of June’s protests and the  Hands Off!  and  50501  protests this spring. They’re confident the movement has grown steadily in response to the administration’s actions.\n \n\n   \n  For local leaders who have tried to push back against what they describe as federal overreach in their cities, Saturday may provide an opportunity to send a message.\n \n\n   \n  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is set to headline the No Kings event in her city this Saturday. Following recent protest activity in Boston,  Trump threatened to pull the FIFA World Cup  out of Massachusetts next year, a move Wu says Trump does not have the authority to make.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible the protests could prompt the administration to send more military force into cities, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n \n\n   \n  The memorandum Trump used to send the first round of federal troops into Los Angeles can be used to take similar action around the country, Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Under this memorandum, troops can be deployed if there are entirely peaceful protests,” she said, calling it “a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  And almost any violence on the part of individual protesters could end up bolstering the administration’s case for calling in troops, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “So might the administration use the protests this weekend as justification to deploy troops? It certainly looks that way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  As for whether people will see troops on the ground in new locations as protests play out Saturday, Goitein noted that it takes some planning to mobilize troops and direct them to a particular location.\n \n\n   \n  “It can’t be done at the snap of anyone’s fingers, so if we were to see the military deployed at these protests, that means it was in the works beforehand,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    DHS advises local agencies to mitigate potential for violence\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the “No Kings 2” protests, Department of Homeland Security officials are warning about the potential for certain events to become violent.\n \n\n   \n  In a DHS intelligence report sent to law enforcement agencies around the nation Thursday, and obtained by CNN, DHS said it is “concerned” about the potential for violence at the demonstrations, “based on several events in the United States in 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  “Throughout these events, we observed behavioral indicators associated with violence and geopolitical developments that have historically driven violence at similar events,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence brief was meant to make law enforcement aware of indicators of possible violence at protests and ways to mitigate them in advance. It did not indicate that US national security officials were aware of any specific and credible threats, nor did it identify any planned protests by name.\n \n\n   \n  Particularly concerning behavior police should be on the lookout for includes the attendance of demonstrators “with a history of exploiting lawful protests to engage in violence” and demonstrators who have engaged in paramilitary-like training, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  Other potentially concerning behaviors included “protesters or counter-protesters engaging in harassing or intimidating behavior, which may escalate to physical violence,” and any indicators individuals may seek to distract and divert police away from an area where criminal activity is planned, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  In order to prevent and counter any possible violence, the intelligence report said law enforcement should communicate with mass transit agencies for awareness of increased travel to a particular area by people from outside the area, and consider limiting protests and counter protests to specific areas.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said law enforcement agencies should also proactively “establish liaisons with the protest organizers and counter-protest groups” and “clearly communicate legal parameters and guidelines to protest and counter-protest organizers so all parties understand the legal limits of activity before enforcement action is taken.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A big tent’ protest effort\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown continues to threaten federal workers’ jobs and seeps into daily life, some Republican lawmakers have suggested that the protests are a distraction compounding the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Asked when the shutdown will end, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week, “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting ‘til this crazy No Kings rally this weekend … No Kings equal no paychecks.”\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg called the criticism “transparently ridiculous,” saying the protests were planned in September, before the government shutdown, and are “a big tent effort” encompassing a range of political identities and viewpoints.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg also pushed back against the idea that the protests are anti-American.\n \n\n   \n  “No Kings is about as American a value as you can imagine. It is as American as apple pie,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “My husband and I were at the flagship event in Philly in June – the birthplace of the nation, which is why we chose it, and we led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg co-founded the progressive grassroots network Indivisible with her husband Ezra Levin in 2016 in response to Trump’s first election. It’s grown to include thousands of local Indivisible groups, which function autonomously but coordinate with national staff.\n \n\n   \n  The  network encompasses  the nonprofits Indivisible Project and Indivisible Civics, which organize protests and trainings, and Indivisible Action, a separate political action committee aiming to elect progressive candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Greenberg said she’s aware that organizations like Indivisible that have taken a public stance against Trump may be targeted by the administration.\n \n\n   \n  After conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s death,  Indivisible joined more than 500 nonprofits  in an open letter condemning what the groups described as the use of government power to target liberal organizations and threaten First Amendment rights.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has recently taken aim at billionaire investor  George Soros  for funding “violent protests,” calling for racketeering charges against the philanthropist, and the White House has called Indivisible a “left-wing activist group” that has “received more than $7.6 million” from Soros.\n \n\n   \n  Soros’ long-running nonprofit,  Open Society Foundations , has provided millions in funding to Indivisible over the years, along with a vast number of predominantly left-leaning causes. Indivisible Project received almost  $8 million in contributions  from various sources in fiscal year 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re heartily aware that there are ongoing efforts to kill organized opposition – to retaliate, to come after people who stand against Trump and his agenda,” Greenberg said. “We’re aware of those things, and also we believe that we have one path forward, which is to continue to exercise our constitutional rights.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/unidentified-palestinian-bodies-handed-over-by-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-17:30","title":"Uncertainty surrounds identities of more than 100 Palestinian bodies handed over by Israel","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 120 Palestinian bodies have been returned by Israel to Gaza under a ceasefire agreement, marked only with numbers and showing signs of torture, binding, and abuse.

than 100 Palestinian bodies handed over by Israel \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Abeer Salman, Mohammed al Sawalhi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:26 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Palestinian forensic experts are working to identify 120 bodies returned to Gaza by Israel marked only with numbers, some of whom were blindfolded, bound at the hands and feet, or bearing gunshot wounds.\n \n\n   \n  Under the  ceasefire agreement  reached with Hamas last week, Israel agreed to transfer the bodies of what it called 360 “Gazan terrorists” into the enclave. Israel hasn’t provided any information about their identities or how they died.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether the 120 individuals whose remains were returned this week died in Israel’s custody, in Gaza during the war, or were killed in Israel as they took part in the October 7, 2023, terror attack.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, health ministry, foreign ministry, justice ministry and the Israel Prison Service for comment, but has not heard back.\n \n\n   \n  Only a handful of the 120 bodies have been identified so far. Two were named publicly by family members on social media as having participated in the assault on Israel on October 7, when thousands of Palestinians breached the perimeter fence.\n \n\n   \n  Many were militants who went on to kill 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, mostly civilians, in communities across southern Israel. Others were ordinary Gazans who crossed into Israel but didn’t participate in the attacks.\n \n\n   \n  The unidentified remains were handed over by Israel to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which then delivered them to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, where forensic experts began examining them.\n \n\n   \n  An official from the Ministry of Health in Gaza told CNN each of the bodies had a document that indicated they were, at some point, held at Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert, and that DNA tests had been performed on them there.\n \n\n   \n  The base has been used by Israel as a detention center, where a number of  cases of abuse of Palestinian detainees  had been reported during the war in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  After the October 7 attacks, Israeli first responders were overwhelmed by the number of bodies found across multiple attack sites.\n \n\n   \n  At that time, members of the ZAKA, an Israeli volunteer search and rescue organization that was  called in to recover the bodies  near the Israel-Gaza perimeter, told CNN that the victims were taken to the Shura Army Base, while remains of the attackers were stored at a different base in the Negev desert.\n \n\n   \n  Doctors at the forensic department at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital described to CNN the state they found the bodies that were handed over this week, saying they showed “signs of abuse and torture.”\n \n\n   \n  “Each martyr is given a number, and all martyrs are bound at the hands and feet. Some are blindfolded, and there are signs of gunshot wounds,” the doctors said.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official said the bodies had broken bones and looked like they had been “crushed by heavy vehicles.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has seen photographs, including closeup shots, of some of the bodies. Zip ties, blindfolds, and gunshot wounds are clearly visible on some of them. Most of the bodies appear to belong to young men, and those who are clothed appear to be wearing civilian clothes. Some of the bodies had dirt on them. One with what appeared to be an IV cannula still in the arm.\n \n\n   \n  The health ministry official told CNN that some of the remains appeared to have been exhumed after burial.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Lawrence Owens, an independent forensic pathologist who looked at photographs of one of the bodies said the person in the picture was almost certainly bound and blindfolded before death, and noted that a fingertip appeared to be missing.\n \n\n   \n  Owens, a research fellow at the University of Winchester, said while the body had lines imprinted on it that appeared to be track marks, it was not nearly as damaged as one would expect if a heavy vehicle had rolled over it. He said, however, that it was possible the body was buried when run over.\n \n\n   \n  Another expert who examined the same photographs also said the deceased individual was bound and that the blindfold was likely applied before death, while the track marks appeared to have been caused after death.\n \n\n   \n  The Ministry of Health has set up a website where it has posted images of the remains in the hopes that family members or friends might be able to identify them. Many of the photographs are extremely graphic, showing wounds and details of partially decomposed bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the remains have already been identified through the website, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n    Mother ‘searched through more than 30 bodies’\n \n\n   \n  Rasmiya Mohammed Khairi Qdeih from the town of Khuza’a in southern Gaza is among those searching for information about her family.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis on Wednesday, she said six of her sons were killed during the war, one has been taken prisoner by Israel, and one has been missing since the day Hamas and its allies in Gaza launched their assault in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  Qdeih said she didn’t know whether the son missing from October 7 was dead or alive. She said he did not participate in the attack but went to Israel when the fence was breached to see what was happening.\n \n\n   \n  “I heard news that they had brought the bodies of prisoners, so I ran (to the hospital) to see if he was among them or not,” she told CNN. “Whenever they bring the bodies of prisoners, I come here and search among them. Yesterday, I searched through more than 30 bodies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Palestinian Center for the Missing and Forcibly Disappeared Persons (PCMFD) said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel’s omission of an official list of names of the deceased “arouses suspicion and strengthens doubts about practices of enforced disappearance and tampering with victims’ files.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stress the necessity of providing complete information about the bodies being handed over and publishing all available information as soon as it arrives, including the names of the victims and details about the circumstances of their deaths, and immediately notifying the families in respect for their right to know and human dignity,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how many more bodies of Palestinians Israel is holding. An Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN last month that the bodies of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was believed to be one of the architects of the October 7 attack, and his brother Mohammed, would not be returned to Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/climate/imo-shipping-carbon-tax-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:14:00Z","title":"US helps sink world’s first global carbon tax after threatening sanctions against countries supporting it","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The world’s first global carbon tax on the shipping industry failed to be adopted at a recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) summit in October 2025, after being delayed by 12 months.

But after four days of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a vociferous US campaign, with President Donald   Trump calling it a “scam tax” and the State Department threatening reprisals on countries supporting it.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say the collapse of the talks marks not only a significant blow for attempts to clean up a heavily climate-polluting industry, undermining decades of negotiations, but also represents  yet another failure  of climate diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  IMO member states  agreed in 2023  that the shipping industry would reach net zero emissions — removing as much planet-heating gas from the atmosphere as it emits — by around 2050.\n \n\n   \n  One of the measures proposed as part of this was a tax on the industry’s climate pollution. The shipping industry would have paid the tax into a fund created by the IMO, to encourage emissions reductions and raise funds for climate action. IMO member nations  approved the tax  at a chaotic April meeting that the US abandoned part way through. The October talks were intended to formally adopt it.\n \n\n   \n  While the tax was supported by members including the European Union, Brazil and small island states such as Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the United   States and Saudi Arabia opposed it strongly.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration spent weeks calling on countries to reject the vote. The US will “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the State Department said in a  statement  this month.\n \n\n   \n  It laid out a series of threats against countries that supported the tax including potentially blocking vessels from US ports, visa restrictions, increased fees and sanctions on “officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on Truth Social Thursday, Trump said he was “outraged” at the vote and that the US “would not stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax.”\n \n\n   \n  After days of chaos and disagreement at the IMO talks, Singapore put forward a motion to delay the decision on Friday, which was called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n   \n  A legally-binding carbon tax on shipping would have been a big deal. “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at the University of Melbourne.\n \n\n   \n  A State Department official told CNN the vote demonstrates American leadership on the global stage: “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The global shipping industry is responsible for  around 3%  of global planet-heating pollution annually, a figure that could rise to 17% by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a 2018 European Parliament  analysis .\n \n\n   \n  The industry has tended to slip under the radar when it comes to climate action, in part because so much of its activity happens in international waters, making the question of accountability for its climate pollution more complex.\n \n\n   \n  The failure to adopt the tax is a huge missed opportunity, experts say .  “Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly,” said Natacha Stamatiou of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n \n\n   \n  There are also fears about what it means for climate diplomacy. Other recent efforts to tackle the escalating climate crisis have either collapsed, such as attempts to negotiate the world’s first global plastics treaty, or failed to meet hopes, including last year’s COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan,  which ended in bitterness  and a finance deal described by some developing countries as a “betrayal.”\n \n\n   \n  Experts are concerned for what this might mean for ambition levels at the upcoming COP30 climate conference in Belém, Brazil, next month.\n \n\n   \n  The failure of the IMO to adopt a carbon tax “marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph John Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate change minister. “This makes the road to Belém and beyond more difficult.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/health/mpox-monkeypox-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:53:00-04:00","title":"California mpox cases raise concerns.

California mpox cases raise concerns. But health officials say the risk remains low \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   New York (AP)  – Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first US cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case.\n \n\n   \n  The risk to the public is low, officials say.\n \n\n   \n  These are not the US first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.\n \n\n   \n  Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”\n \n\n   \n   Mpox  — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.\n \n\n   \n  One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the US  was averaging  close to 500 cases per day.\n \n\n   \n  The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned  later that year , thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\n \n\n   \n  The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.\n \n\n   \n  A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem  had waned enough  that it was no longer an international emergency.\n \n\n   \n  Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\n \n\n   \n  The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding.\n \n\n   \n  Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”\n \n\n   \n  A US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/jodie-turner-smith-victorias-secret-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:33:00.000Z","title":"Look of the Week: From Jimi Hendrix to Jodie Turner-Smith, why fashion loves a military jacket","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The fashion world is experiencing a revival of the Hussar pelisse, a military-style jacket with historical roots, as seen in recent appearances by celebrities like Jodie Turner-Smith, Zendaya, and Jenna Ortega.

loves a military jacket \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:33 PM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Attention! The fashion set has just deployed a new fall jacket that could become a wardrobe mainstay for us all. Earlier this week at the Victoria’s Secret after-party in New York, Jodie Turner-Smith arrived in a pair of relaxed, low-slung light wash jeans, a white vest and a black, white and red military jacket that looked nothing short of Napoleonic.\n \n\n   \n  Identifiable by elaborate braiding, decorative buttons, and often toggles across the chest, military coats — also known as the Hussar jacket or Pelisse — appear to be making a comeback. While Turner-Smith, who also attended  the brand’s latest runway show  as a VIP guest, got her Hussar coat from Georgian-based brand Keburia, she’s not the only celebrity who has been spotted in military-style outerwear in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  At Paris Fashion Week, Zendaya was snapped outside the Louis Vuitton show at the Louvre, dressed in a metallic, fur-trimmed dress-coat with a Rococo edge. While some fashion enthusiasts may be revisiting Marie Antoinette as a source of sartorial inspiration in the light of  the blockbuster London exhibition dedicated to the French Queen’s style , Zendaya’s look took more cues from King Louis XVI. The following day at Dior, Jenna Ortega was seen in a gothic black sleeveless Hussar vest, the frog fastenings embroidered intricately with gold thread and finished with shining buttons. She completed her look with aviator sunglasses, bleached brows and a denim mini-skirt.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, this isn’t the first time modern dressers have dusted off 18th-century military outerwear in the name of fashion. The late American guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix, who once briefly enlisted in the US army, owned and wore several different types of Hussar pelisses in the 1960s. Hendrix wore the coats unbuttoned, sometimes shirtless, and adorned with pendant necklaces; other times he styled them with vibrant silk scarves or blouses, subverting their original context as strict uniforms for obedient, militant officers.\n \n\n   \n  This playful, bohemian upending of a rigid, historical garment started a wave of subversive iterations from luxury brands, including Saint Laurent, Balmain, Gucci and Marc Jacobs — which in 2002 presented cream wool Hussar jackets trimmed with red and finished in gold stitching, worn with paisley blouses that seemed to be   in the Hendrix style. But when The Beatles wore the decorated military coats of yore on the cover of the 1967 album “Sargent Peppers and the Lonely Hearts Club,” it was less about communicating sex appeal and more about anti-establishment and anti-war sentiments. They wore their delicious, candy-colored satin guard coats buttoned to the top, like four fanciful colonels on the regimen of peace and love.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the Hussar pelisse ironically became something of a uniform in the early aughts for musicians, including Michael Jackson, Beyoncé and Rihanna, and bands such as British alt-indie group The Libertines and US pop-punk band My Chemical Romance. In 2005, Kate Moss, then-girlfriend of The Libertines front man Pete Doherty, led the charge in making the trend mainstream with an ivory version worn to the Glastonbury music festival.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the style is back on our catwalks, as seen at Jonathan Anderson’s debut menswear collection for Dior, as well as in recent collections by McQueen, Vaquera and Ann Demeulemeester. And word spreads fast — according to Molly Rooyakkers, who runs the data-driven fashion Instagram account  @styleanalytics , global searches for “Hussar jacket” have increased 300% in October compared to the previous month.

I think that as a coach, if you really want to love your players, then you got to get to know your players on a personal level,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa was a stand-out  soccer  player as a teenager, but he failed an exam and didn’t go to college in Japan. His passion, joy and energy were gone. But everything changed when Matsuzawa’s parents offered their son a chance to visit the US.\n \n\n   \n  An  NFL  game between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams that he attended fueled his fire to one day return to America and pursue his dreams. It’s no wonder that winning kick against Stanford was so special for both player and coach alike.\n \n\n   \n  “I really wanted to win that game, especially like week zero. Visualization is really important. I was ready for a game-time field goal and a game-winning field goal. I’m telling myself I am elite. And then focus on myself as one of the biggest things,” Matsuzawa revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Sheffield added: “I was like crying like a baby, I just told him, ‘Man, your parents are here to see this.’ That was the coolest part for me was seeing somebody who works so hard and overcome so many battles and so much adversity to get to that moment. And there’s nobody that deserves it more than this kid because of the journey.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rainbow Warriors kicker has had to work hard for all he’s achieved in life so far and especially so when it comes to finances.\n \n\n   \n  Before moving to the US, he would wait tables back in Japan at his local steakhouse in Tokyo. At one point, he was even cutting his own hair to save money. He would upload clips of his kicking to his social media hoping somebody – somewhere – would take notice and give him a chance.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, a school in Nelsonville, Ohio, did and Matsuzawa credits the time he spent at Hocking College before his move to Hawaii as playing a significant role in greatly improving his English. And then there were huge, selfless sacrifices made by his parents, such as the trip the family took to the US.\n \n\n   \n  So just imagine the joy and elation he went through when he learned, at long last, he was to be awarded a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. It was a moment that would cause him to break down in tears.\n \n\n   \n  “That was amazing. I feel like it’s one of the toughest things to walk on to a scholarship in college football. It’s really tough, but (the) coaches believed in me. That moment is so amazing for me and my family,” Matsuzawa said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re paying my tuition, paying my rent. It was tough for my family. My family moved to a different place, a cheaper house, to help.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment Matsuzawa – who’s majoring in sports management – learned he was getting a life-changing scholarship was actually witnessed first-hand by Sheffield himself.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one recording it. I got to record it because I knew it was coming. It was one of the most rewarding things when you see a kid who just follows his dreams and meets his potential, and that we just get to play a small part of it. It gets you emotionally. It’s like watching your son achieve a big dream and a big goal and reaping the benefits of all the hard work,” Sheffield said.\n \n\n   \n  Matsuzawa says he’s inspired by his idol and compatriot: baseball superstar  Shohei Ohtani .\n \n\n   \n  “Like everyone, I’m just watching him on TV. But his mindset and his preparation are a different level, and if I want to be like him, I have got to have the same mindset and preparation to perform to the highest level.”\n \n\n   \n  And as for Matsuzawa’s future, it won’t surprise you to learn he’s already dreaming big, hoping one day he might even get to play in the  NFL . And if he does, he would become the first Japanese national ever to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of dreams, but since day one, I’m going to NFL, win Super Bowl, play 10 years in the NFL – you know, big contract!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/tech/instagram-parental-controls-ai-characters-teens","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-04:00","title":"Instagram to Let Parents Stop Teens from Chatting with AI Characters","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Instagram, owned by Meta, is launching new parental controls to allow parents to restrict teens’ access to AI chat interactions, including the ability to disable access to individual AI characters or block specific ones.

The app will also show parents information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters. The company said it’s building the controls now and users will start seeing them early next year.\n \n\n   \n  The move comes after Meta and the tech industry more broadly have grappled with criticisms from parents  and lawmakers  that online platforms aren’t doing enough to protect children online.\n \n\n   \n  Concerns have also been raised about whether people are relying on AI for emotional support and companionship. A wave of reports this year have indicated that some   people have endured emotional distress and isolated themselves from family members after developing  close relationships   with chatbots  like ChatGPT.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple lawsuits have been  filed against the company behind Character.AI , another popular app for chatting with AI personas, over allegations that the platform played a role in self-harm and suicide in teens. A lawsuit was also  filed against OpenAI  in August over allegations that ChatGPT contributed to the suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine. And a  Wall Street Journal investigation  from April found that Meta’s chatbot and other AI chatbots on its platforms would engage in sexual conversations even with accounts identifying as minors.\n \n\n   \n  Meta said its AI characters “are designed not to engage” in conversations with teens about “self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating” or topics that “encourage, promote or enable” those subjects. Teens are also only able to chat with certain AI characters related to content like education and sports, the blog post said.\n \n\n   \n  Instagram’s new parental controls follow other updates the company has recently made to better protect teens. Earlier this week it adjusted its “Teen Accounts” settings to  line up with PG-13 ratings , meaning it won’t show or promote posts featuring strong language or those that could promote “harmful behaviors.” In late September, OpenAI announced parental controls for ChatGPT that reduce “graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/north-korea-submunition-russia-ukraine-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00-04:00","title":"North Korean submunition found in drone used to attack Ukraine, report finds","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A North Korean submunition, marked with Juche calendar references indicating a 2000 production date, was discovered in a drone used to attack Ukraine’s Kherson port city in September 2024.

wouldn’t change a thing \n       \n  By Ben Church, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:49 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a rare interview,  Lia Thomas  described what life was like as arguably the most prominent transgender swimmer in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas has been the subject of global scrutiny after  winning  a host of NCAA women’s races, triggering an outcry from those who thought she – as a transgender woman – held an unfair advantage over her competitors.\n \n\n   \n  The issue was given extra attention after the Trump administration  ordered  the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), for whom Thomas competed, to erase the transgender swimmer’s records.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Penn  modified a trio  of school records set by Thomas and said it would apologize to the female athletes she competed against.\n \n\n   \n  In an extensive interview with Philadelphia-based public media outlet  WHYY  just before Penn’s decision, Thomas spoke about the impact so much attention has had on her life and career.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas last competed for Penn in 2022 and, in 2024, lost a legal battle against the global swimming governing body  World Aquatics  which prevented her from competing in elite women’s races due to its new policy.\n \n\n   \n  As such, her life as a professional swimmer was over.\n \n\n   \n  “I still swim occasionally, just on my own at a local YMCA,” Thomas told WHYY.\n \n\n   \n  “With everything that happened my senior year and has happened since, it’s very easy to slip into almost like a negative perception of swimming, where swimming and being in the water just brings up all that pain and all those feelings of grief all over again and very fresh. It takes a lot of effort to try to focus on the joy that swimming still brings me.\n \n\n   \n  “There are moments where I can just, I can find that escape that it was for me as a child, and just let everything sort of wash away and it feels almost like I’m flying, and it still absolutely, it can be that place of peace and happiness, but it unfortunately takes a concerted effort at times.”\n \n\n   \n    Finding acceptance\n \n\n   \n  In the interview, Thomas spoke openly about how she struggled with  gender dysphoria  during her younger years and said swimming was often a way of escaping her problems.\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said she knew she was trans just before starting college and that it felt like a “wonderful realization” before fears about how people would react came creeping in.\n \n\n   \n  “The toughest conversation was the first time I came out to my parents. And that was the most sort of terrified I’ve ever been in my life,” Thomas said, adding her parents were initially confused but supportive.\n \n\n   \n  “They were caught totally off guard. They had no idea; they did not see it coming.\n \n\n   \n  “What I think essentially happened in between that first conversation and the next conversation was they tried to research what being trans was and meant. And, in doing that, fell into essentially transphobic misinformation rabbit holes.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said her parents needed time to accept her desire to transition and that it took them seeing how happy she was to fully understand her decision. She hopes that, ultimately, the same will happen with sections of society and media.\n \n\n   \n  “They parroted a lot of really transphobic talking points, and it caused a lot of harm. But it wasn’t totally unsalvageable,” Thomas said.\n \n\n   \n  “What fixed it, what healed that relationship, was seeing just how much this meant to me. And also after starting hormone replacement therapy, seeing just how much happier I was when I was being true to myself. And every day more that they saw that, they only solidified their support and have come fully around and are now some of my biggest supporters.”\n \n\n   \n    Advice to children\n \n\n   \n  There were times, Thomas said, that she felt the whole world was against her.

sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Zachary Cohen, Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:34 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  did not take the possibility of the US sending long-range  Tomahawk cruise missiles  to Ukraine off the table during  his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin , sources familiar with their conversation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump is also not expected to commit to providing the potentially game changing American-made weapons in  his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  at the White House on Friday, two of the sources said, though they cautioned that things can always change once the president is alone in a room with the Ukrainians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president, in both public and private,  has appeared more willing  to allow Ukraine to obtain the long-range missiles in recent weeks, US officials said. The administration has drawn up plans to provide the weapons to Ukraine, the officials said, in case Trump gives the order, which they stress he can do at any time if he feels it is right.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been holding off, hoping to ascertain from Zelensky a better idea of how he planned to use them, the officials added.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and his top aides have described the weapons — which have a range of more than 1,000 miles — as potentially turning the tide in the war against Russia. And they’ve said they viewed the possibility of receiving them as an attractive threat that Zelensky hoped would force Putin back to the table.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s exactly what it appears to have done — though it remains unclear what, if anything, may have changed since Trump and Putin met in Alaska two months ago that would make the prospect of a peace agreement more likely.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 24 hours before Zelensky was slated to meet with Trump in Washington, Putin made a last-ditch attempt to intervene with the American president and halt all talk of sending the lethal US weapons to Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  His lengthy phone call resulted in a promise to have the two leaders meet in Budapest “within two weeks or so,” in Trump’s telling — which appears to have bought Moscow more time as Trump’s desire to reach a peace agreement has grown even further following his administration’s success in Middle East negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, did not drop his new military threats while speaking with Putin on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I did actually say, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump told reporters later that day. “He didn’t like the idea.”\n \n\n   \n  A Trump administration official argued it’s all about leverage: “Why would he give up that leverage? He won’t remove the threat until it’s no longer necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  Another US official echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Trump is looking to bring the war to an end and is focusing on a diplomatic approach first — suggesting the threat of sending Tomahawks to Ukraine is one tool he has at his disposal as part of that effort.\n \n\n   \n  Putin is said to have stressed during the call that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield,  CNN previously reported.  But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued.\n \n\n   \n  Putin has previously argued that if Trump chooses to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, it would completely alter the level of US involvement in the war thus far, noting that the weapons would likely require Americans to operate them.\n \n\n   \n  The risk of escalation is also a concern among some US officials, though others said previous steps that appeared escalatory — like allowing Ukraine to have more powerful missile systems or weapons — did not significantly escalate the conflict.\n \n\n   \n   The story headline has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-relationship-history","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-04:00","title":"Jennifer Lopez Doesn’t Believe She’s Ever ‘Truly Been Loved.’ Here’s a Reminder of Everyone She’s Talking About","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Lopez reflects on her romantic relationships, expressing that she believes she has never been 'truly loved' because she feels her partners lack the emotional capacity to love her deeply.

doesn’t believe she’s ever ‘truly been loved.’ Here’s a reminder of everyone she’s talking about \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jennifer Lopez knows a thing or two about love and relationships.\n \n\n   \n  The singer-dancer-actress recently appeared on Howard Stern’s show and talk turned to her love life. Lopez said it’s difficult being in a romantic relationship when you are famous.\n \n\n   \n  Stern asked: “Do you think you’ve truly been loved?” She paused and responded “no” before switching to “yes,” as she considered if she had “really experienced loving someone.”\n \n\n   \n  “What I learned is it’s not that I’m not lovable,” she said. “It’s that they’re not capable.”\n \n\n   \n  Who’s not capable? Here’s a reminder of the high-profile relationships Lopez has been in over the years.\n \n\n   \n    Ojani Noa\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was married to the Cuban waiter from 1997 to 1998, which is around the time her career took off, thanks to her starring role in the hit film “Selena” about the beloved murdered Tejano singer.\n \n\n   \n  Noa went on to become a model and actor. He also attempted to publish a tell-all about their relationship which Lopez successfully sued to have blocked.\n \n\n   \n    Sean “Diddy” Combs\n \n\n   \n  Lopez had an on-again and off-again relationship with the music mogul from 1999 to 2001 and they were the focus of a great deal of  media attention in that time. \n \n\n   \n  She stood beside him after the couple, Combs’ bodyguard Anthony “Wolf” Jones and the rapper Shyne Barrow, a Combs protégé, were involved in a disagreement at Club New York in Manhattan that ended with gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were injured, and while the men and Lopez were initially arrested, charges against her were soon dropped. Combs and Jones  were later acquitted in the incident .\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Combs split in 2001, and two years later  she told Vibe magazine  infidelity played a role in their breakup.\n \n\n   \n  ”It was the first time I was with someone who wasn’t faithful,” she said. “I was in this relationship with Puff” — that’s the nickname Combs went by at the time — “where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin.”\n \n\n   \n    Cris Judd\n \n\n   \n  She married her former backup dancer in 2001 and in 2013 he shared the story of how his life changed after he was cast to dance in her “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” video in 2000.\n \n\n   \n  “So when Jennifer walks in, I shake her hand and we kinda look at each other – and in my head, I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to marry this woman,’” he said during an episode of “Oprah: Where Are They Now?”  as per Huffington Post. \n \n\n   \n  The couple tried to keep their relationship under wraps, Judd said.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess the first introduction to me being with her was when we were at the Oscars. It was just bedlam,” he said. “I’ve never seen so many people concentrated in one place, especially cameras. I knew she was there to do a job, and so I was just that guy who was just by her side.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple finalized their divorce in 2003 — at which time Lopez was already involved with her “Gigli” co-star, Ben Affleck.\n \n\n   \n    Marc Anthony\n \n\n   \n  Lopez was engaged to Affleck (we will circle back to that and him later) from 2002 to 2004 and months after they split, she shocked fans when she married Marc Anthony, the Latino singer and actor.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez and Anthony collaborated on music together and also co-starred in the 2006 film “El Cantante” which was based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe.\n \n\n   \n  In 2008 they welcomed fraternal twins, Emme and Max.\n \n\n   \n  Lopez  talked to British Vogue  in 2024 about motherhood.\n \n\n   \n  “You always want to put your best foot forward for your kids, you want to lift them up — that doesn’t stop you from being a human being who struggles,” she said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  She and Anthony announced their split in 2011,  he filed for divorce the following year  and and it was finalized in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    Casper Smart\n \n\n   \n  The dancer-actor-choreographer was one of Lopez’s longest relationships that didn’t make it to the altar.\n \n\n   \n  While they were on-again and off-again, they dated from 2011 to 2016 and Smart had good things to say about her.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s sweet, funny, nice, easygoing and gracious,”  Smart said of Lopez.  “You can’t ask for anything more. She’s beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  Their breakup was reportedly amicable.\n \n\n   \n    Alex Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Many thought Lopez had met her match in the legendary baseball player.\n \n\n   \n  She and the former New York Yankees shortstop started dating in 2017 and seemed like a match made in social media heaven with their posts of supporting each other in everything from red carpets to yoga class.\n \n\n   \n  The pair got engaged in 2019. But in March 2021, there was some confusion as reports swirled that they had split, only to have them say days later in a statement that they were still a couple after all.\n \n\n   \n  A month later they confirmed that their engagement was off.\n \n\n   \n  “We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so. We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects,” they said in a joint statement. “We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.”\n \n\n   \n    Ben Affleck\n \n\n   \n  Lopez spun the block with this actor-director.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after she and Rodriguez broke things off, Affleck was photographed visiting her Los Angeles home.\n \n\n   \n  First time around, of course, the couple had dated and gotten engaged in 2002 before having a high-profile split in September 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realized that something was awry,” they said in a statement. “We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN at the time that the couple was “taking a break.”\n \n\n   \n  She was with Rodriguez in 2020 when Affleck raved about Lopez  to CNN while promoting his film, “The Way Back.” \n \n\n   \n  He said he had no regrets about making “Gigli” because “I made a great friendship with Jennifer Lopez, who I think is a fabulous person and I’m so excited for her continued success.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think she always got the respect that she deserved, in part, because she was a powerful woman,” he said. “And also because she was a Latina and she was really groundbreaking and nobody wanted to acknowledge that. They just wanted to kind of hate, so it’s nice to see her having that success.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck and Lopez went public with the fact they were back together in July 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Months later he expressed his gratitude for second chances in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, calling his rekindled romance with Lopez “beautiful.”\n \n\n   \n  “My life now reflects not just the person that I want to be, but the person that I really feel like I am — which is not perfect, but somebody who tries very hard and cares very much about being honest and authentic and accountable,” he told the publication. “It’s hard to say who benefits more, without going into gossipy detail.”\n \n\n   \n  The pair became  engaged  once again in April 2022, after Affleck surprised Lopez with a proposal while she was in the bathtub.\n \n\n   \n  They eloped in July of that year by  traveling to Las Vegas  with their children and the following month held a lavish wedding on Affleck’s sprawling estate outside of Savannah, Georgia, complete with famous friends like Matt Damon and director Kevin Smith in attendance alongside their families.\n \n\n   \n  She  filed for divorce  from Affleck last year, on the anniversary of their second wedding.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/europe/sigfrido-ranucci-bomb-investigative-journalist-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00-04:00","title":"Bomb explodes outside home of top Italian investigative journalist","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bomb exploded outside the home of Italian investigative journalist Sigfrido Ranucci, who hosts RAI’s 'Report,' a program known for its critical reporting on government actions.

become an NBA head coach \n       \n  By Ben Church, Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:27 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Las Vegas Aces  head coach  Becky Hammon  sees no reason why a woman can’t lead an NBA team in her lifetime but told  CNN Sports  that it would take a “whole lot” to pull her away from her current role.\n \n\n   \n  Her comments come after  Dawn Staley , the long-time head coach of the South Carolina women’s basketball team, said she doesn’t believe there will be a female head coach in the NBA during her lifetime.\n \n\n   \n  Staley, who recently interviewed to be head coach of the New York Knicks, also suggested that the  NBA  isn’t ready to have a woman lead an organization.\n \n\n   \n  But Hammon, who recently led the Aces to yet another WNBA championship on October 10, is more optimistic, while acknowledging there needs to be more growth in the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it could happen in our lifetime,” Hammon said to CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “There is really not a good reason why it hasn’t happened already. I think there are qualified women that could coach in the NBA, it’s just the matter of getting that opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star in her 16-year playing career, is one of the female head coaches that many believe could make the transition to the NBA given her incredible record in the game.\n \n\n   \n  She has now guided Las Vegas to three championships in the past four years after  making history  as the first full-time female assistant coach in NBA history by the San Antonio Spurs in 2014.\n \n\n   \n    NBA experience\n \n\n   \n  During her time in San Antonio, Hammon became the first woman to lead an NBA team as a head coach during the regular season, when she took over for Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich after he was ejected during a game.\n \n\n   \n  She has since said she’s interviewed for several head coaching positions in the league.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was in the NBA, in some ways I thought it could happen right away and then in other ways, I thought this is 20 to 30 years from happening,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “If men can lead women, there is no reason why women can’t lead men. Just because it hasn’t been done, doesn’t mean it can’t be done.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, this is basketball. People follow great characters and great leadership. People follow people that they know can help them.\n \n\n   \n  “In my experience with the NBA, the players were always great. It’s the higher-ups, that are the decision-makers, that have more of an issue of maybe taking directions from a woman.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked whether she would be interested in taking a head coaching job in the NBA, Hammon said she was very happy with the Aces.\n \n\n   \n  The 48-year-old has helped create the league’s latest dynasty – a term she’s reluctant to fully accept – and is very content with life in Sin City.\n \n\n   \n  However, she said she would take calls if NBA teams wanted to speak.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been building something now for four years,” she said about her time with the Aces. “I love winning, I love the city of Las Vegas and my bosses that I answer to.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll take calls, but it would take a whole lot to pull me from here.”\n \n\n   \n    Dynasty building\n \n\n   \n  Hammon has been enjoying yet another title celebration this week after Las Las Vegas’ most recent triumph.\n \n\n   \n  The Aces secured the third championship in franchise history with a 97-86 win over the Phoenix Mercury last week to sweep the Finals.\n \n\n   \n  With celebrations down the famed Vegas Strip set for Friday, Hammon is relishing in what she called the hardest championship to win.\n \n\n   \n  The start of the 2025 season was a grueling one for the Aces, who began the year 14-14 before winning their last 16 regular season games.\n \n\n   \n  “It hits a little different this year, just the journey and the routes that we had to go through. It was tough. It’s that more rewarding,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “We  fell short last year , I think everybody had to retool a little bit, reroute, gameplan a little bit differently and find a way to get back on top.\n \n\n   \n  “We went around the mountain, up the mountain, down the mountain, back to the mountain top again and it feels really good this time around for sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Many are now calling the Aces basketball’s latest dynasty, but it’s a phrase that doesn’t sit totally comfortably with Hammon.\n \n\n   \n  She does, though, concede her team is “flirting” with the term after dominating the league in recent seasons.\n \n\n   \n  “A dynasty is different because of the culture and standard for what it takes. You see a lot of one-offs in sports,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “You got to have a lot of things go your way, you’ve got to have a little luck and you’ve got to get the right pieces and the right pieces playing together at the right time.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/style/picasso-still-life-guitar-missing-spain-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Picasso painting goes missing en route to exhibition","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 1919 gouache painting by Pablo Picasso titled 'Still Life with Guitar' went missing during its scheduled delivery to a temporary exhibition at the CajaGranada Cultural Center in Granada, Spain.

after it apparently vanished on the way to an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  The 1919 gouache work “Still Life with Guitar,” which measures just 12.7 centimeters by 9.8 centimeters (5 inches x 3.9 inches), was supposed go on display from October 9, as part of a temporary exhibition at CajaGranada Cultural Center in the southern Spanish city of Granada.   \n \n\n   \n  The work is owned by a private collector and was insured for an estimated 600,000 euros ($700,000), the CajaGranada Foundation, which owns the cultural center, confirmed to Reuters Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The Friday before the exhibition was due to open, a van belonging to a transportation company arrived at the cultural center as scheduled to deliver works from Madrid, CajaGranada Foundation said in a press statement Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  All the works were moved in a single, continuous movement from the van to a freight elevator that took all the transportation company employees at once from floor -1 to floor 1, the center said.\n \n\n   \n  The items were then transferred from the elevator to the exhibition hall under video surveillance, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  After verifying the origins of the different packages, the exhibition manager agreed with the transportation company that the delivery would be signed for, ahead of the unpackaging of the pieces the following Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The packages remained under video surveillance at all time over the weekend, and the unpacking began at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, according to the center.\n \n\n   \n  The recordings have been checked and no incidents occurred over the weekend, it said.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-morning, the CajaGranada Foundation staff had finished unpacking the works and had positioned them in the room.\n \n\n   \n  This is when the exhibition curator and head of exhibitions realized Picasso’s “Still Life with Guitar,” known by its Spanish title as “Naturaleza muerta con guitarra,” was missing.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation then reported the missing work to the police, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The video recordings from the weekend were checked and no incidents had occurred, it said.\n \n\n   \n  “An investigation is currently underway, and the investigation is attempting to determine when and where the painting disappeared,” Granada police said in a statement to CNN on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The police said the missing work has been added to the international database of stolen artworks but noted that there is no international police cooperation currently being carried out from Granada.\n \n\n   \n  Thieves have often targeted Picasso’s paintings, which have fetched up to $179 million at auction.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, a  Dutch art detective recovered Picasso’s 1938 masterpiece  “Portrait of Dora Maar,” worth $28 million, 20 years after it was stolen from the yacht of a Saudi sheikh off the south coast of France.\n \n\n   \n  In 2021,  Greek police recovered Picasso’s “Head of a Woman”  and Piet Mondrian’s “Landscape with a Mill” almost a decade after they were taken in a daring heist at the National Art Gallery in Athens.\n \n\n   \n  And last year,  Belgian police found Picasso’s stolen painting “Tête”  in a basement in the city of Antwerp.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Philadelphia Phillies were the last team to achieve that feat in 2009, while no team has won back-to-back World Series since the New York Yankees clinched three in a row between 1998 and 2000.\n \n\n   \n  Brewers pitcher Jacob Misiorowski’s excellent performance from the mound – striking out nine, a Milwaukee rookie postseason record – ensured that Thursday’s game was a tight affair through five innings, but LA took the lead in the sixth on Tommy Edman’s RBI single.\n \n\n   \n  A throwing error from Abner Uribe then allowed Freddie Freeman to score, resulting in the Dodgers going 3-1 ahead and closing out the game.\n \n\n   \n  The chances of reaching the World Series are now heavily stacked in LA’s favor.

The Blue Jays will be hoping to ride their momentum and take the series lead for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re in the biggest moment of the season right now, these games are must-win, every single one of them,” Scherzer told reporters. “When you get success, it’s great. This is what you play for. You work so hard the whole year, make all the sacrifices, put all the work in to get to this moment.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just a great effort by our team all the way around – our offense, our defense, our relievers,” he added. “Everyone contributed tonight and that’s what makes it special.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/oklahoma-schools-bible-mandate-rescinded","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-05:00","title":"Oklahoma Schools Superintendent Rescinds Bible Instruction Mandate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma’s new public schools superintendent, Lindel Fields, has rescinded a controversial mandate introduced by former Superintendent Ryan Walters that required Bibles to be placed in classrooms and incorporated into student lesson plans for grades 5 through 12.

Here’s what the experts say \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lindsey Martin’s electricity bill reached $314 in July, the highest bill she had received this year until that point, she said on TikTok. In the video’s more than 4,000 comments, many users reported similar power-bill spikes.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s bill jumped even higher in August to $372, a notable leap from around $150 two to three years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought that was so high, I could not believe my bill was $150,” Martin, a Kentucky-based registered nurse, told CNN over the phone. “And now I wish my bill was $150.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin isn’t alone. Residential electricity costs are on the rise, according to  data  from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The average price of electricity in America has increased 13% since 2022, with the cost of retail electricity expected to grow faster than the rate of inflation, the report says. Some regions, like the Pacific, Middle Atlantic and New England, could see even higher increases than the national average.\n \n\n   \n  The increases have largely been driven by the costs of updating and maintaining the power grid and other necessary infrastructure, particularly in the face of increasingly common severe weather events, according to experts on energy and computing who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But a new technological wave is also driving up electricity bills: The AI boom is boosting electricity demand and power resources as tech giants pour billions into what many believe is the biggest computing shift in decades. OpenAI and Broadcom announced  a partnership  just this week to design and develop 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and systems, more than enough to power a major city.\n \n\n   \n  That trend is only expected to continue. Data centers are projected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a December 2024 report from the  Department of Energy . A  Bloomberg News analysis  found that areas near data centers saw an increase in electricity costs of as much as 267% compared to five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The power industry just isn’t equipped to keep up, said Bob Johnson, an analyst with market research firm Gartner who follows the semiconductor industry.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Explosion in demand’ for AI\n \n\n   \n  Investment in data centers has moved fast as tech behemoths stake the future of their businesses on AI. Meta said it spent $17 billion in capital expenditures, which typically refers to money spent on data centers and infrastructure, for the quarter that ended in June, while Microsoft said it spent $24.2 billion. Data center construction spending reached  a high of $40 billion  in June, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\n \n\n   \n  Existing data centers likely need to be updated to ensure they have enough capacity to handle new power-hungry AI services and products.\n \n\n   \n  That growth is contributing to more electricity demand than the United States has seen in two decades, leading to a need for more investment in electricity generation and transmission, said Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group that represents electricity buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Other factors behind the increased demand include a shift to electric-based heating systems in homes and new manufacturing plants, according to the Bank of America report.\n \n\n   \n  There weren’t enough data center construction and upgrades in the past to affect consumer prices, said Ram Rajagopal, senior fellow for Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy. But now the AI industry is seeing an “explosion in demand.”\n \n\n   \n  AI tools are also growing increasingly sophisticated, evolving beyond text-based queries to handle complex tasks like generating realistic video clips in a matter of seconds and coding websites from scratch. This means they also require more resources than ever.\n \n\n   \n  “AI is really computationally intensive,” said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.\n \n\n   \n    What goes into your electricity bill\n \n\n   \n  Rates vary by location, but retail electricity prices generally include the “cost of generating, transmitting and delivering” electricity and can sometimes factor in investment in upgrading infrastructure, according to the EIA.\n \n\n   \n  Large buyers of electricity typically pay lower rates because the distribution infrastructure is less complex; power needs to be piped to one location rather than hundreds or thousands of homes, said Johnson. Pricing models haven’t been updated to take into account the surge in data center growth, he said, although that can vary by location.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon, for example,  passed a bill  requiring data centers to “pay for the actual strain they place on Oregon’s electrical grid” so that the costs don’t get passed on to the consumer.\n \n\n   \n  “In other words, the homeowners shouldn’t have to pay for data centers, but that’s not built into the pricing structure,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/soccer-europa-league-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"06:01:00-04:00","title":"UK Authorities Seek to Reverse Decision to Ban Maccabi Tel Aviv Fans from Villa Game","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"UK authorities are working to reverse a decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a Europa League game against Aston Villa in November 2025, citing security concerns.

EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One essential Social Security employee didn’t foresee her surgery being upended by the  federal government shutdown  when she scheduled it for early October.\n \n\n   \n  But the longtime manager decided to postpone the procedure, which would have required her to take two weeks off to recover, fearing that she could lose her job if she was absent from work.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because taking sick leave during the shutdown would result in her being furloughed for those days. What’s more, the furlough notice would be filed under “disciplinary and adverse actions” in her employee record — an unprecedented categorization during a funding lapse, according to a Social Security union leader and outside experts in government service. (CNN has viewed the agency’s FAQ instructing supervisors to store furlough notices under that designation.)\n \n\n   \n  Between that potential black mark and the  general sense of anxiety  pervading her office, the employee said she felt, “This is not the time. I could not take a chance on having weeks of furlough and being laid off.”\n \n\n   \n  Essential workers at several federal agencies said they are worried about taking time off or are being told that requests for leave would not be granted during the shutdown, which began on October 1 after Congress failed to agree to a federal spending package. It’s adding to the insecurity they have felt all year as the Trump administration overhauls and downsizes the federal workforce.\n \n\n   \n  A government shutdown is often stressful both for furloughed employees, who are not allowed to work, and for certain essential staffers, who must still report for duty, because  neither group is paid  until after the shutdown ends. But this impasse is even more fraught because President Donald Trump is threatening federal workers’ jobs and their ability to get back pay.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has already issued  reductions in force, or RIF, notices  to about 4,100 federal workers over the past week — a move that a  federal judge paused  on Wednesday, declaring it unlawful — and has warned  it will lay off thousands  more during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has called into question a 2019 law that guarantees that furloughed workers will receive  retroactive compensation  once the government reopens, though lawmakers remain far from reaching a deal.\n \n\n   \n  One employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs told CNN that his supervisor asked him if he was sure he wanted to take his preapproved time off during the shutdown, a question he’d never been asked before and one that put him on edge. He thought about canceling his vacation, but decided not to, despite being unsure whether he’ll be paid for those days and whether his absence will jeopardize his career.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m mad, so I’m just going to take it off,” he said — though the uncertainty casts a shadow over his vacation.\n \n\n   \n  While it’s standard for essential employees to be listed as furloughed for the hours or days they miss work during an impasse, that designation is more risky now, workers said.\n \n\n   \n  “It shows who the agency can run without,” the Social Security manager said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about categorizing furlough notices as “disciplinary and adverse action,” a Social Security Administration spokesperson said, “SSA has followed its standard practice for how it manages furlough activities during a government lapse in appropriation, including how we provide notice to staff on their furlough status and where we have always stored the notices in our personnel records.”\n \n\n   \n    Mixed messages on leave\n \n\n   \n  Internal Revenue Service employees in Atlanta have received “conflicting guidance from managers about whether essential workers could take scheduled leave or medical time off,” Denise Wells-Gomez, National Treasury Employees Union chapter president, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Messages viewed by CNN instructed essential staff that vacation or sick leave could not be used and that any absence, even for surgeries or medical procedures, would be treated as AWOL (absent without leave).\n \n\n   \n  One internal message from managers to staff, viewed by CNN, warned that they could be terminated if employees weren’t present the day they decide to do an audit.\n \n\n   \n  However, during a staff meeting, the director of the IRS Atlanta office appeared unaware this guidance was being circulated and clarified that essential workers could still take leave if it was approved by their manager. Despite that, employees continued receiving instructions that “no exceptions” would be allowed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, at the VA, a regional director informed staffers that they could take leave that had already been approved before the shutdown, but no new leave would be authorized, the agency employee told CNN. The worker’s supervisor said the same thing.\n \n\n   \n  The IRS and VA did not return requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple employees in different Social Security offices have told Joel Smith, their union representative, that their supervisors have said that if they don’t show up for work, they could be let go. Having their furlough notices filed as a disciplinary action — which he said has not happened in the past — is compounding their concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “People are feeling they have to choose between their job and their health,” said Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which represents about 6,000 Social Security workers in offices across the South and Southwest.\n \n\n   \n  Taking a day off during a shutdown is not dishonorable, said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on improving the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  Having it “be a black mark on your record is, as they say, piling mistreatment upon mistreatment, and, to my knowledge, has never been done before,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/sport/football-nfl-week-8-bengals-steelers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"20:11:00-04:00","title":"Joe Flacco outduels Aaron Rodgers in battle of elder statesmen as Bengals stun Steelers in ‘Icy Hot Bowl’","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-intensity Thursday Night Football matchup dubbed the 'Icy Hot Bowl' by Steelers teammate Cameron Heyward, 40-year-old Joe Flacco outperformed 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in a dramatic 33-31 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

outduels Aaron Rodgers in battle of elder statesmen as Bengals stun Steelers in ‘Icy Hot Bowl’ \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:11 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the  NFL  remains a young man’s game as a whole, Thursday Night Football was a good example that the old guys can still sling it.\n \n\n   \n  The contest saw 40-year-old Joe Flacco face 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers as the Cincinnati Bengals hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers and was dubbed the “Icy Hot Bowl” by Rodgers’ Steelers teammate, Cameron Heyward, beforehand.\n \n\n   \n  And despite having a combined age of 81, the two oldest quarterbacks in the NFL currently showed that they can still produce on the top level, with both having productive outings in a high-scoring affair.\n \n\n   \n  In the end though, it was Flacco – making just his second Bengals start since being traded from the Cleveland Browns – who came out on top, with the Bengals winning 33-31.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns – one apiece to Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Noah Fant – as well as orchestrating a  field goal  drive in the final minutes which would turn out to be the decisive score.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco was parachuted into Cincinnati following the long-term toe injury suffered by  Joe Burrow  and the streaky play of back-up passer Jake Browning. And after losing his debut to the Green Bay Packers last week, the Super Bowl XLVII champion got in the win column to keep the Bengals’ season alive at 3-4.\n \n\n   \n  “This is what we do it for is games like that,” Flacco said after the victory. “It came down to the wire just like we know it’s going to. Really, really happy about how the guys just kind of stayed with it for a full 60 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  “Man, our offensive line was going today. We were running the football, protecting, doing a lot of things that we wanted to do.”\n \n\n   \n  Pittsburgh had raced out into a 10-0 lead midway through the second quarter but 20 straight points from the Bengals put them on top at Paycor Stadium.\n \n\n   \n  The teams traded scores until a long 68-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to tight end Pat Freiermuth and the ensuing extra point gave the Steelers a one-point lead with just over two minutes remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But the experienced Flacco was able to put together an eight-play, 52-yard drive which drained the majority of the clock to set up a 36-yard field goal for Evan McPherson which he converted to give the home team a two-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  It left Rodgers and the Steelers just seven seconds to attempt a miracle comeback but it came to nothing and Flacco had his first win in Cincinnati.\n \n\n   \n  “Outstanding. Outstanding. Outstanding. It was outstanding, really,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said of Flacco’s night.\n \n\n   \n  “We scored on, what, like six of the last seven drives maybe? Seven of the last eight. And really early on, we had some drops and some quirky stuff happen that prevented a score there. So, just thought his performance was outstanding. Very calm, collected, led us in the two-minute drive to go win the game.”\n \n\n   \n  A key reason for trading for Flacco was the hope that he’d get their star-studded offense firing and he seems to have done so. Both Chase and Higgins had big nights – Chase had 16 catches for 161 yards while Higgins had six catches for 96 yards, a season high – and the running game had its best outing so far this year, with Chase Brown rushing for over 100 yards for the first time this season.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the defeat, it was a productive evening for Steelers quarterback Rodgers who threw four touchdowns and two interceptions on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  There was a moment of history for the former Green Bay Packers and New York Jets star during the game, as he  moved up to fifth place  in the all-time career passing yards leaderboard, moving past Pittsburgh’s all-time leading passer and long-time contemporary Ben Roethlisberger.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers needed 116 passing yards to pass Roethlisberger and cruised past him with a 15-yard connection with Jaylen Warren in the second quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Rodgers finished the game with 64,222 yards, still over 7,000 yards behind Brett Favre in fourth.\n \n\n   \n  The Steelers fall to 4-2 but still remain atop the AFC North with a big clash against the Green Bay Packers to come in Week 8 on Sunday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/us/wisconsin-man-tiktok-ice-agents-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:58:00-05:00","title":"Wisconsin man charged after posting TikTok videos calling for the killing of ICE agents, prosecutors say","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Andrew Stanton, a 38-year-old man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been charged with threatening federal law enforcement officials, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, after posting a series of threatening TikTok videos from August to October 2025.

including threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a US official, court records show.\n \n\n   \n  His arrest comes amid heightened tensions nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operations and criticism over  aggressive tactics  observed to be used by immigration agents. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and that its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  Stanton pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Thursday in US District Court in Milwaukee.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Stanton was behind multiple threatening TikTok videos posted from various accounts between August and October this year, according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  In one video posted four days before his arrest, Stanton allegedly called for ICE agents to be targeted, saying in the video, “If they (ICE) show up to your neighborhood…it’s time we start shooting at you,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Stanton’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to the  New York Times , John Bradley, a lawyer for Stanton, said: “It is important to remember that the contents of a criminal complaint represent one side of the story and are just allegations. Mr. Stanton pled not guilty. He is presumed innocent, and we will vigorously defend against these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Stanton is also accused of suggesting that mass shootings can be applied to federal agents, prosecutors said, citing a video posted in September.

Federal investigators flagged that an account registered to Stanton asked for information about the whereabouts of members of the Israeli military in the Illinois and Wisconsin area, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  A video posted near the end of August also featured Stanton with text superimposed on the screen that read in part, “a violent state can only be stopped with violence in return” and “I think we should be OFFING federal agents,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to use bullets,” he was quoted as saying in the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal law enforcement officers tried to interview Stanton multiple times, in person and over the phone, in early September but were unsuccessful, the complaint said.\n \n\n   \n  On September 11, a supervisor with US Customs and Border Patrol identified himself by first name in a text to Stanton and said he wanted to speak with him about his recent posts. In response, Stanton told him to go away, using an expletive, and sent a series of hostile messages, as well as one asking to meet in person, the complaint alleges.\n \n\n   \n  A pretrial conference in Stanton’s case is scheduled for December 1, and his trial is scheduled for December 15, according to federal court records.

Su was a superstar.\n \n\n   \n  Now boasting over 300,000 followers on  Instagram  and over 2,000,000 on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Su is one of the most recognizable faces heading into next year’s Winter Olympics in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel really honored and feel really lucky to have so many people who always look at me,” he tells  CNN Sports  from a training camp in Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m always looking up to my idols, in snowboarding or even in life, so I really know what it means to the younger generation to look up to their idol.\n \n\n   \n  “I really try to be better, and try to show young people that once you have a dream, once you have something you love, just putting 100% to go chase for your dream, and then it will come one day.”\n \n\n   \n    Path to Mount Olympus\n \n\n   \n  Su’s rise to Olympic champion is no accident.\n \n\n   \n  Both his mom and dad were snowboarders and he remembers finding himself playing on the slopes from the age of four, when his parents couldn’t find anyone else to look after him.\n \n\n   \n  At first, he used a board that was bigger than he was. It took a while, almost five years, before he grew into it.\n \n\n   \n  By then, the slopes in northern China became his second home. It’s a place which feels totally natural to Su. In today’s fast-paced world, where he finds himself being pulled from one major city to another, the 21-year-old still longs to spend time out in the wild, where the only thing that matters is having fun on his board.\n \n\n   \n    Life as a film star\n \n\n   \n  But before he became a sporting icon, Su’s first break into the public consciousness came in the world of acting.\n \n\n   \n  When producers of a new film were looking for a child who was comfortable on the snow, Su swapped out his board for skis to play Zi Shuan in the popular film “The Taking of Tiger Mountain.”\n \n\n   \n  The film and his character struck a chord with the Chinese public and Su saw his acting career blossom, going on to feature in several other films and television series.\n \n\n   \n  “That memory just gives me a really special feeling,” he said, looking back at his time as a child actor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m pretty sure a lot of people at that age can’t experience so many crazy things. It’s pretty crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  But while his acting career went from strength to strength, he never let go of his love for snowboarding and a fire was lit in his heart after Beijing was picked to host the 2022 Winter Games.\n \n\n   \n  He turned his attention full-time to the sport in 2018, competing in his first proper competition a year later where his potential was clear to see.\n \n\n   \n    Making of a champion\n \n\n   \n  Whether he performed well or poorly in competitions, the youngster kept dreaming of making it to the Olympics and dedicated his entire life to improving.\n \n\n   \n  Then, after a stellar year before the Games, Su was chosen to represent his nation. What happened next, was just the icing on the cake.\n \n\n   \n  He won two medals, the first a silver and then the magical gold. It was the defining moment of his young life.\n \n\n   \n  But after the fanfare died down, Su was left with a hole. For most of his teenage life, he had dreamed of winning gold at the Winter Olympics. Once he achieved his wildest ambition, there was a period of transition where he lost his motivation.\n \n\n   \n  “I kind of lost my passion for competing,” he said. “I still loved snowboarding, but I decided to take a year and a half off to take some rest for my mental and also for my body.\n \n\n   \n  “Every morning I woke up, there was a dream, some goal you wanted to chase for, that’s why you put in your 100% and work really hard.\n \n\n   \n  “But right after I won the gold, the next morning I woke up and thought there was nothing else I wanted. It feels really empty at that point.”\n \n\n   \n  Much like other sporting prodigies, such as US tennis star  Amanda Anisimova , Su spent the ensuing months recharging his batteries. He enjoyed time off with family and friends, immersing himself in nature and pursuing his other interests, such as fashion.\n \n\n   \n  “I still got out snowboarding, but just without any purpose, and not for competition, just trying to have fun,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that definitely helped. I felt like I just needed some time to take a rest – snowboarding is just a part of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  After that reset, he returned to competitive snowboarding with a new ambition of retaining his Olympic title in Italy.\n \n\n   \n  Life, for him, looks very different heading into his second Winter Games and Su knows there will be a target on his back during the competition.\n \n\n   \n  “I got more pressure going into the next Olympics because, for the last one, I was just kind of a nobody, and it was just more about challenging myself,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “People are expecting more from you, and that’s why you feel pressure from yourself. But I spent a lot of time talking to my family and I took those years off after the Olympics to set my mind in the right spot. I use those pressures for motivation.”\n \n\n   \n    Pool, fishing and surfing\n \n\n   \n  Su knows he’s in the privileged position of being in high demand. He has ventures in several different fields and is growing his profile around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s exhausting just hearing about the things such a young man can fit into his 24 hours, but it’s a schedule that seems to energize him.\n \n\n   \n  But balance, he said, helps him enjoy his often hectic life and career.\n \n\n   \n  While his stock is rocketing around the world, the skateboarding sensation remains humble, grounded by those who know him best.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a pretty chilled guy, especially when I’m back home. It’s the time you can finally relax,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been enjoying spending time with family, just eating dinner together and then having a conversation. That feels really special, it’s like recharging.\n \n\n   \n  “Also, when at home, I go play pool with my friends and I go fishing and surfing. I’m not the guy who wants to be at home and watch his phone or a movie. I’m trying to get close to nature and doing a lot of stuff that feels like I’m connected to nature.”\n \n\n   \n  But the world is set to see the other side of Su in February next year, the one capable of being the best snowboarder on the planet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/ice-arrests-chicago-suburb-police-officer-hanover-park","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:41:00-04:00","title":"ICE arrests police officer in Chicago suburb and accuses him of being in US illegally","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"ICE arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, accusing him of overstaying a Montenegrin tourist visa that expired in 2015.

AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most people go to work for the paycheck and benefits. What they typically don’t expect is to have to return   some of the money   when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  But with some benefits — such as signing or retention bonuses, tuition reimbursement and some forms of training — workers may have to pay their employer back if they’re subject to a so-called stay-or-pay agreement, which specifies that the employee will be on the hook to repay the company for the cost of certain benefits if they don’t stay at the organization for a minimum amount of time.\n \n\n   \n  Why? On the one hand, “employers are trying to get a reasonable return on their investment,” said Jonathan Crook, a partner at Fisher Phillips, which represents management in labor and employment matters.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, paying for benefits intended to attract or retain employees only to have them get the benefit and then quit — and potentially work for a competitor — doesn’t offer a great ROI for the employer.\n \n\n   \n  But there are some instances when “stay or pay” agreements are viewed as abusive and limiting employee mobility, especially when they apply to lower income workers and involving what are called training repayment agreements (sometimes referred to, especially by critics, as TRAPs).\n \n\n   \n  “TRAPs are often forced on workers as a condition of employment and require workers who receive on-the-job training — regardless of the quality or necessity of that training — to pay back the supposed cost if they leave their job before the end of a specified term,” Chris Hicks, a senior policy adviser at consumer advocacy group Protect Borrowers,  wrote  in a blog.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, they might charge a quitting fee of thousands of dollars, should an employee leave for another job.\n \n\n   \n  Even if a contract is not enforced, labor advocates say, just knowing of its existence still can pressure employees into staying rather than seeking a better job elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how widespread stay-or-pay agreements are. Researchers from the University of Michigan, Cornell University and the University of Maryland estimated that such agreements — including anything from on-the-job training to paying for an employee’s MBA program — could affect as many as  1 in 11 workers (8.7%) .\n \n\n   \n  Historically, according to a  2023 report  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Employers’ use of TRAPs began in the 1990s, predominantly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions, such as engineers, securities brokers, and airline pilots. Still in use in those industries, they are now also common in lower- and moderate-wage industries where jobs are disproportionately held by women and minorities, such as in the healthcare, transportation, and retail industries.”\n \n\n   \n    New California law bans certain provisions, allows others\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a first-in-the-nation  measure  banning certain stay-or-pay provisions and putting guardrails around others. It takes effect on January 1, 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Among the new prohibitions: California-based employers may not seek repayment for on-the-job training, except for apprentice programs approved by the  Division of Apprenticeship Standards . And they may not seek repayment for any type of benefit when a worker is let go without cause or their job is eliminated.\n \n\n   \n  But the new law still allows employers to impose some types of stay-or-pay agreements if they meet certain guardrails. Among those still allowed in addition to approved apprentice programs are signing or retention bonuses, government-sponsored loan repayment assistance and tuition reimbursement but only for “transferable credentials” (meaning a degree or certificate from an accredited third party that is not specific to the person’s job). In terms of bonuses and tuition reimbursement, if an employee leaves sooner than the stay period, the amount of money they need to repay must be prorated. So if an employee gets a signing bonus but only stays at the company for half the time required, they will only need to pay the company half the amount when they leave.\n \n\n   \n  Employees also must have the option to take their bonus when they leave the company rather than when they start, so they don’t risk owing money if they leave before the end of the stay period — which will now be limited to two years and may not include interest accrual.\n \n\n   \n  The move was welcomed by the California Nurses Association, which represents one of the industries in which such stay-or-pay agreements have been used. “With the threat of having to pay back a debt or fee to their employer, ‘stay-or-pay’ contracts indenture workers to remain at a job and chills workers from seeking better wages or working conditions,” the union said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  It is too early to predict how the new law will influence the way employers operating across multiple states, including California, might draft their own stay-or-pay provisions, Crook said.\n \n\n   \n  Or how many other states may follow in California’s footsteps.\n \n\n   \n  Protect Borrowers notes that there have been legislative efforts to restrict stay-or-pay agreements in several other states, including New York, which passed the “Trapped at Work Act” in June, although it has yet to be signed by Governor Kathy Hochul.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/15/us/airport-cyber-breach-pennsylvania-canada-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"03:21:00Z","title":"Apparent Hackers Take Over PA Systems at 4 North American Airports","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Unauthorized pro-Palestinian political messages, praising Hamas and criticizing US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were broadcast through public address systems at four North American airports — Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), Kelowna (British Columbia), Victoria (British Columbia), and Windsor (Ontario) — on October 17, 2025.

pro-Palestinian political messages praising Hamas and attacking President Donald Trump and Israel’s prime minister were broadcast through public address systems in terminals at four airports in North America on Tuesday, disrupting operations and sparking investigations into the apparent hacks.\n \n\n   \n  Videos posted by passengers on social media show the unauthorized recordings played at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  Incidents were also reported at Kelowna International Airport and Victoria International Airport in British Columbia along with Windsor International Airport in Ontario, according to Transport Canada, which regulates airports in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the messages praise Hamas and, using expletives, are critical of the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “This is absolutely unacceptable and understandably scared travelers,” US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on  social media , adding the FAA is working with the Harrisburg airport “to help get to the bottom of this hack.”\n \n\n   \n  The breaches come as the air travel industry has been dealing with an onslaught of cyberattacks that have caused disruptions for customers and ground some of the world’s largest airports to a halt. In June, a notorious cybercriminal group  breached the computer networks  of multiple airlines in the US and Canada, according to the FBI. And last month,  hackers knocked out  a passenger check-in system, causing long delays, cancellations and chaos at airports across Europe.\n \n\n   \n  At the Harrisburg airport Tuesday, “an unauthorized user gained access to the airport PA system and played an unauthorized recorded message,” airport spokesperson Scott Miller told  CNN affiliate WGAL .\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Glen Brown said at first he was confused at what he was hearing, but then he started worrying about what else could be going on.\n \n\n   \n  “You had to do a double-take and ask yourself if what you were hearing was actually real,” he said. “The real question I have is, if they hack the paging system in an international airport, what else are they tunneling into?\n \n\n   \n  “The message was political in nature and did not contain any threats against the airport, our tenants, airlines, or passengers. The PA system was shut off, and the incident is under investigation by police,” the statement from Miller added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Harrisburg International Airport Police Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration for comment.\n \n\n   \n  During the incident, one flight was in the process of boarding, Miller said.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution, the aircraft was searched. No security issues were found, and the flight departed safely,” the statement added.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, more than 2,000 miles away, Kelowna International Airport reported a similar incident.\n \n\n   \n  “The airport staff was about as in the dark as we were,” one passenger who was waiting for a flight said. “They even had to resort to using megaphones to give people boarding information because the intercom was down.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  shared with CNN, the airport said a third party accessed both its flight information display screens and public address system.\n \n\n   \n  “Free Palestine,” and pro-Palestinian chants could be heard in a video posted by the passenger on social media who told CNN: “Nobody informed us what was going on, there was no crisis response. Everyone was just really confused.”\n \n\n   \n  Messages praising Hamas in its war with Israel were also broadcast on screens inside Kelowna airport, according to multiple photos shared on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Kelowna airport officials said the unauthorized messages were removed and flight display systems restored, adding efforts to fully restore the PA system were ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  At Victoria International Airport, “an unauthorized audio message” was also broadcast over the public address system due to “a cloud-based software issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank our passengers for their patience and cooperation,” the airport said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  At Windsor International Airport, the terminal was nearly empty because there were no flights immediately arriving or departing, airport President Mark Galvin said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our team responded quickly, removed the images and shut off the recorded PA announcement,” he said. “We returned to normal shortly thereafter and have been operating without incident.”\n \n\n   \n  Transport Canada tells CNN it is “working closely with federal security partners, including law enforcement, to ensure there were no impacts on the safety and security of airport operations, and to mitigate disruption from similar incidents in the future.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for more information.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with further details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/why-the-bolton-indictment-is-different-from-comey-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Why the Bolton Indictment is Different from the Comey and James Cases","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has been indicted on 18 counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, with claims that he shared such data with family members lacking security clearances.

He allegedly shared the information with family members who didn’t have security clearances.\n \n\n   \n  That rapid progression means Bolton’s indictment will often be lumped in with Comey’s and James’s as an example of Trump weaponizing the justice system against his foes. Trump’s role in orchestrating the charges against Comey and James has certainly warranted that narrative, given it has  no parallel in decades of American politics .\n \n\n   \n  “Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,” Bolton said in a statement late Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton’s lawyer Abbe Lowell denied that Bolton had kept or shared classified information and said records he claimed the charges stem from were “known to the FBI as far back as 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  But there are also some key differences in Bolton’s case and suggestions that it could be more substantial than those brought against James and Comey.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s dig in.\n \n\n   \n    The differences\n \n\n   \n   The way the case was brought \n \n\n   \n  In Bolton’s case, there is less of a throughline between Trump’s conduct and the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Bolton is also someone Trump spotlighted for prosecution, like Comey and James. As far back as 2020, Trump accused Bolton of breaking the law and warned there would be “a really big price to pay.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now he will have bombs dropped on him!” Trump  said .\n \n\n   \n  But Trump doesn’t appear to have played a similar role in orchestrating the charges against Bolton, at least from what we know. He didn’t publicly push for the charges as much in recent weeks. And he certainly didn’t force out a prosecutor who resisted the charges before installing a loyalist who brought them, like he did in the Eastern District of Virginia (the site of the Comey and James cases).\n \n\n   \n  The Bolton charges also were ultimately brought by experienced prosecutors, including US Attorney Kelly O. Hayes, who has served in the District of Maryland since 2013, and nonpartisan career prosecutor Tom Sullivan.\n \n\n   \n  In Comey’s and James’s cases, Trump’s handpicked US Attorney Lindsey Halligan was essentially forced to bring the charges herself, after other prosecutors balked or were removed.\n \n\n   \n   A judge once suggested Bolton might have broken the law \n \n\n   \n  That Bolton is facing charges isn’t nearly as surprising. In fact, a federal judge back in 2020 basically warned of exactly that.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in Bolton’s favor in a civil case stemming from a dispute with the Trump administration over the publication of Bolton’s book. But Lamberth otherwise  excoriated Bolton  for his handling of classified information.\n \n\n   \n  Lamberth said in  his ruling  that Bolton “likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.”\n \n\n   \n  “He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability,” Lamberth said in his conclusion.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s charges are somewhat different than the issues in that civil case, in that Bolton is charged with retaining and transmitting sensitive information, rather than publishing it in his book as the administration claimed back then. But Lamberth certainly felt Bolton had played fast and loose with this information, which is at the heart of the charges.\n \n\n   \n  There are also other reasons to believe this case is more substantial.\n \n\n   \n  Those include the fact that a judge greenlit  a search of Bolton’s properties  back in August. CNN has also reported that, while the Biden Justice Department didn’t bring these charges, this particular focus of the investigation began under the Biden administration. And the indictment also includes much more detail than the Comey and James indictments, suggesting a more thorough investigation.\n \n\n   \n   The stakes \n \n\n   \n  What Bolton is accused of is, quite simply, a much bigger deal than Comey’s alleged false statement to Congress and James’s alleged mortgage fraud – an alleged offense which even the available evidence suggests would  only have netted her a few thousand dollars .\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton isn’t just accused of retaining and transmitting the information; the indictment also claims this information could have been exposed to hostile foreign actors.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment states that, sometime in the two years after Bolton left the White House in 2019, “a cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran hacked BOLTON’s personal email account and gained unauthorized access to the classified and national defense information in that account.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment says Bolton notified the government of the hack but not the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n \n\n   \n  CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said that, if that can be proved, it will show Bolton’s mishandling of classified information  to be more serious  than the series of prominent politicians facing similar problems in recent years – including Hillary Clinton and Trump himself.\n \n\n   \n    The similarities\n \n\n   \n   Trump has singled out Bolton \n \n\n   \n  Even as Trump didn’t publicly push as hard for Bolton’s prosecution in recent weeks – he generally seemed more content to let the process play out and say relatively little, compared to James and Comey – there is no question he has targeted Bolton for retribution.\n \n\n   \n  For one, Trump has explicitly accused Bolton of crimes and suggested he should be prosecuted, which isn’t what presidents are supposed to do.\n \n\n   \n  Bolton said Thursday that Trump’s calls for retribution against him “became one of his rallying cries in his reelection campaign.”\n \n\n   \n  For another, Trump has singled Bolton out for punishment in other ways, including stripping him of his  security clearance  and even canceling his  security detail , despite Bolton having faced an alleged assassination threat from Iran.\n \n\n   \n  And Bolton’s name also appeared on now-FBI Director Kash Patel’s list of “deep state” members in his 2023 book – a list critics have labeled an “enemies list.” Indeed, two people on that list have now been indicted (Bolton and Comey), and others have faced investigations even at this early juncture in Trump’s second term.\n \n\n   \n  Patel and other prominent DOJ officials also  made a show of publicizing the Bolton search  back in August, in ways that are not normal.\n \n\n   \n  “NO ONE is above the law…  @FBI  agents on mission,” Patel posted around 7 a.m., right around the time the search was conducted.\n \n\n   \n  All of these data points suggest the politicization of this matter, whether or not the charges are ultimately warranted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"04:10:00-04:00","title":"Commander overseeing US forces in the Caribbean to retire one year into tenure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Admiral Alvin Holsey, who has led U.S. Southern Command in the Caribbean since November 2024, is retiring at the end of 2025—marking one year into his tenure.

US forces in the Caribbean to retire one year into tenure \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:10 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The admiral overseeing US Southern Command, which has responsibility for forces in the Caribbean, where the US has carried out multiple legally ambiguous strikes against alleged drug cartels, is retiring one year into his tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post on X on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The news comes  just days  after the US military conducted its fifth known strike on a boat alleged to be trafficking drugs off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It also comes one day after President Donald Trump said publicly that he had  authorized the CIA  to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on the flow of drugs and migrants. Also on Wednesday, US Air Force B-52 bombers flew off the coast of Venezuela for more than four hours, CNN previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions had been simmering between Hegseth and Adm. Alvin Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean, and he complained about not being given the information he needed about the operations, the sources said. But SOUTHCOM was concerned about the operations not being lawful, the sources added.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions came to a head during a meeting between Hegseth, Holsey and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on October 6 at the Pentagon, one of the sources said. Holsey offered to resign during the meeting, the source said, but the idea was tabled and his departure was not announced until over a week later. His departure will also not be imminent — instead, he’ll retire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon’s spokesperson Sean Parnell denied on X that Holsey ever expressed reservations about the counter-narcotic mission in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey confirmed in a statement on X that on December 12, 2025, “I will retire from the US Navy.”\n \n\n   \n  “Serving as your commander and deputy for the past 34 months has been a tremendous honor,” Holsey wrote. “The SOUTHCOM team has made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so. I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the US Navy nor Southern Command have responded to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey was sworn in as the commander of Southern Command in November 2024. Holsey’s predecessor, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, served as the Southern Command commander from 2021 to 2025 before retiring.\n \n\n   \n  Holsey has served in uniform for 37 years since commissioning from the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps in 1988, according to his official Navy biography. His previous assignments have included commander of the Navy’s Carrier Strike Group One, an operations officer in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and most recently as the Military Deputy Commander at Southern Command.\n \n\n   \n  “On behalf of the Department of War, we extend our deepest gratitude to Admiral Alvin Holsey for his more than 37 years of distinguished service to our nation as he plans to retire at year’s end,” Hegseth said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has replaced a number of senior officers across the military since taking over as Secretary this year, including by firing former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former Chief of Naval Operations; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of staff of the Air Force; and Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, former head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect Holsey’s current rank. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/india/india-us-trump-russia-oil-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"India Denies US Claim It Agreed to Stop Buying Russian Oil","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him India would stop importing Russian oil, a claim India strongly denies.

New Delhi says it knows nothing about it \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:22 AM EDT, Fri October 17, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   India  has seemingly pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s claim it had agreed to stop importing Russian oil, signaling the issue that has strained ties is unlikely to be resolved soon.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Wednesday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “assured me today that they (India) will not be buying oil from Russia,” which is subject to US sanctions, describing it as a “big step.”\n \n\n   \n  But on Thursday India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters he was “not aware of any conversation” between Trump and Modi, or any assurance from the Indian leader that he would stop purchasing Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier in the day, India’s foreign ministry said the country was a “significant importer of oil and gas,” without naming Russia nor referencing Modi’s purported assurance.\n \n\n   \n  “Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  India has long maintained close ties with the Kremlin and is due to host Russian President Vladimir Putin later this year. It has emerged as one of the top buyers of Russian oil since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The war sparked massive sanctions against Moscow’s oil industry and sent prices cratering.\n \n\n   \n  For months, New Delhi has resisted Trump’s calls  to cease purchasing Russian oil,  saying it would not bend over the energy needs of its booming economy and growing population, now at more than 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Trump announced an additional 25% tariff on India as a penalty for importing Russian oil and gas, building on a previously announced 25% tariff rate.\n \n\n   \n  It would be almost impossible for India to suddenly halt purchases of crude from Russia, its largest supplier, said Muyu Xu, a senior oil analyst at trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n \n\n   \n  Russia delivered roughly 1.7–1.8 million barrels per day, according to Xu, who cited figures covering the first nine months of this year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think India can stop buying Russian oil overnight. The volumes are simply too large,” she told CNN. “Replacing that volume from the spot market is no easy task. Beyond the sheer quantity, differences in crude quality and refinery yields make substitution far from a one for one swap.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from Kpler shows state-owned refiners trimmed back Russian purchases in recent months, while some private players increased their intake of Russian barrels.\n \n\n   \n  The state-owned Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 10.35 million barrels of Russian oil in January compared to 4.62 million barrels in September, data from Kpler shows. So far in October, Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 7.03 million barrels, the data showed.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has contacted Indian Oil Corporation Limited to ask if it plans to continue purchasing Russian oil and the factors guiding their strategy of sourcing from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Modi’s refusal to kowtow to US pressure plays to his political brand built around the image of a strong leader helming an India that is focused on its own interests on the world stage.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, officials from New Delhi and Washington have focused on diplomacy to get the relationship back on track, with trade delegations focusing on closing a deal.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar acknowledged that India “has issues with the United States,” attributing a significant portion of the friction to unresolved trade negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  He noted that the two countries “have not arrived at a landing ground for our trade discussions,” but said that India is actively working to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  “Those issues need to be negotiated and discussed and resolved, which is exactly what we are trying to do,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/dave-taylor-symbol-american-flag","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"12:44:00-04:00","title":"GOP lawmaker claims his and other Republican offices have been ‘targeted’ with flags depicting ‘vile’ symbol","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Republican Representative Dave Taylor of Ohio claims that his office and other Republican offices were targeted with American flags altered to include a 'vile' symbol, which he suspects is a swastika.

Those entries, prosecutors say, were printed and remained on personal devices used by Bolton and others in his home.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolton used his personal non-governmental email accounts, such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google, to email information classified” to the individual’s personal email accounts, the indictment states.\n \n\n   \n  “Often, Bolton’s notes described the secure setting or environment in which he learned the national defense and classified information that he was memorializing in his notes,” prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The purpose Bolton stated of creating a group chat in which he would later share his notes taken during his work as a national security adviser, the indictment says, was “For Diary in the future!!!”\n \n\n   \n  “The FBI’s investigation revealed that John Bolton allegedly transmitted top secret information using personal online accounts and retained said documents in his house in direct violation of federal law,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors made use of Bolton’s voluminous media commentary on the sharing of classified information and use of encrypted chats to make the case that the former national security adviser has a strong “understanding of how to properly handle classified information and the potential consequences of failing to do so,” according to the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  In one criticism of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time leading the State Department – cited by the indictment – Bolton said in 2017, a year prior to his service under Trump, “if I had done at the State Department what [senior U.S. Government official] did, I’d be [imprisoned] right now.”\n \n\n   \n    Bolton says he’s a victim of Trump’s DOJ\n \n\n   \n  Bolton issued a statement Thursday night saying he has become Trump’s latest target in the weaponization of his Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  He said that his book, “The Room Where It Happened,” was reviewed and approved by “the appropriate, experienced career clearance officials” and that the FBI was made fully aware of his email hack in 2021. In the four years of the Biden administration, Bolton said, no charges were filed against him.\n \n\n   \n  “Then came Trump 2 who embodies what Joseph Stalin’s head of secret police once said, ‘You show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime,’” Bolton said.\n \n\n   \n  “These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” he added. “Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom. I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump, meanwhile, was at the White House, doing a press event on  IVF drug prices  when the indictment was handed up.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s, you know, a bad person. I think he’s a bad guy,” Trump said when told of the indictment. “Yeah, he’s a bad guy, too bad, but that’s the way it goes, right?”\n \n\n   \n    Investigation began during Biden years\n \n\n   \n  While the first Trump Justice Department had initially sought to block Bolton’s 2020 memoir and investigated whether Bolton violated the law by including information the administration said was classified, that case was closed in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an Iran hack investigation started in 2021 under Biden that brought things to the current point.\n \n\n   \n  For prosecutors and FBI investigators, part of their effort has focused on keeping the case out of the roiling politics looming over the Justice Department as Trump has publicly pushed for the prosecution of his political enemies, which includes Bolton.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike prosecutions brought against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the Bolton case has maintained the support of career prosecutors and investigators, people briefed on the matter said.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next for Bolton?\n \n\n   \n  The charges — if proven — are possibly more serious than those in other high-profile investigations into the mishandling of classified material, such as those related to Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Joe Biden and Trump, said CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Bolton is alleged to have “actively disseminated” classified information of the “highest level” to family members who had no security clearance. And when Bolton’s email was hacked by Iran, he allegedly omitted that he had been using the email account to share such information.\n \n\n   \n  “If DOJ can prove this, this is big, big trouble for John Bolton,” Honig said.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been assigned to US District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama in 2014.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Donald Judd and Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/europe/us-russia-budapest-talks-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:03:00-04:00","title":"Will Putin’s call lure Trump closer to the Kremlin?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recently held nearly two-and-a-half-hour phone call, Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged directly with U.S. President Donald Trump to avert discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which could threaten Russian cities.

They would just damage the US-Russian relationship, he added, which he knows Trump values so highly.\n \n\n   \n  According to one Kremlin aide, Putin also praised Trump as a peacemaker in the Middle East and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  Economic deals were again dangled, and – crucially – there was an agreement for a second face-to-face presidential summit, this time in Budapest, Hungary, where ending the Ukraine war could once more be discussed, if not agreed.\n \n\n   \n  That will raise inevitable comparisons with the failed  Alaska summit  just a few months ago, when Trump gave Putin a red-carpet reception but secured no tangible results in his push for a Ukraine peace deal.\n \n\n   \n  But now, flushed with his achievements in  brokering a ceasefire in Gaza , and the release of Israeli hostages, Trump has suggested that his success in the Middle East, against the odds, will help end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  How remains unclear. The Kremlin has offered no suggestion that it is prepared to compromise. Despite mounting battlefield casualties and increasing Ukrainian drone attacks on its energy infrastructure, causing fuel shortages across the country, Russia has consistently ruled out ending the war in Ukraine until it has achieved its maximalist objectives.\n \n\n   \n  These include gaining control over vast swathes of annexed Ukrainian territory not yet conquered, and imposing strict military and foreign policy limits on a postwar Ukraine that would essentially subjugate Kyiv to Moscow’s will.\n \n\n   \n  Nothing in the latest Trump-Putin phone call suggested any of this had changed.\n \n\n   \n  But over the past nine months of this second Trump administration, the Kremlin has also learned that offering personal engagement, and holding out the possibility of a short-term win, can be just as effective as any painful compromise.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials, gathering in Washington, say it is the discussion of Tomahawks that forced Putin back into dialogue.\n \n\n   \n  That may be true. But the calculation here in Moscow is that the mere prospect of progress on peace talks may be enough to lure Trump, hungry for a deal, into dropping his military threats.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/susan-stamberg-death-npr-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-04:00","title":"Susan Stamberg, first woman to host a national news program, dies at age 87","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Susan Stamberg, the first woman to host a national news program on National Public Radio (NPR), has died at age 87.

She was 87.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg died Thursday, NPR reported. It did not provide a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg joined NPR in the early 1970s when it was getting off the ground as a network of radio stations across the country. During her career, she interviewed thousands of people, from prominent politicians and artists to the less well-known like White House chefs and people who work behind the scenes in Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  She explained in an oral history interview with Oregon station KLCC in January that she didn’t have women in broadcast to model herself after when she became the host of “All Things Considered” in 1972.\n \n\n   \n  “The only ones on were men, and the only thing I knew to do was imitate them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She lowered her voice to sound authoritative. After a few days, Bill Siemering, the program manager, told her to be herself.\n \n\n   \n  “And that was new too in its day, because everybody else, the women, were trained actors, and so they came with a very careful accents and very careful delivery. They weren’t relaxed and natural,” she said. “So we made a new sound with radio as well, with NPR.”\n \n\n   \n   NPR’s obituary for Stamberg  quoted her colleague Jack Mitchell saying she had an “obvious New York accent.”\n \n\n   \n  “All Things Considered” only had five reporters to draw on while they filled their 90-minute program, creating a daily challenge.\n \n\n   \n  She told KLCC that she coined the term “founding mother” to refer to herself and three other women who helped launch the NPR: Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and Linda Wertheimer.\n \n\n   \n  “I got tired of hearing about Founding Fathers, and I knew we were not that, so we were obviously Founding Mothers, and I was going to put that on the map,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg hosted “All Things Considered” for 14 years. She went on to host “Weekend Edition Sunday,” where she started the Sunday puzzle feature with Will Shortz.\n \n\n   \n  Shortz, who continues to serve as the program’s puzzle master and who is now the crossword editor of the New York Times, explained that Stamberg wanted the show to be the radio equivalent of a Sunday newspaper that provided news, culture, sports and a puzzle.\n \n\n   \n  She later became a cultural correspondent for “Morning Edition” and “Weekend Edition Saturday.” She retired in September.\n \n\n   \n  In 1979, she hosted a two-hour radio call-in program with then-President Jimmy Carter from the Oval Office. She managed the listeners who called in to speak with him. The questions were not screened beforehand. It was the second time Carter had a call-in program after the first with Walter Cronkite.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, which said she was known for her “conversational style, intelligence, and knack for finding an interesting story.” She interviewed Nancy Reagan, Annie Liebowitz, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin, among thousands of others.\n \n\n   \n  She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Stamberg was born Susan Levitt in Newark, New Jersey, in 1938 but grew up in Manhattan.

drug pricing deal for ‘TrumpRx’ site \n       \n  By Sarah Owermohle, Meg Tirrell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:04 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday announced an agreement to sell common fertility drugs at steeply reduced prices on TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer drug platform the White House plans to launch in January 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Under the plan, cost to patients for three in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs made by EMD Serono, the US arm of German company Merck KGaA, could be reduced by more than 70%, Trump and administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The drugs, sold under the brand names Gonal-F, Ovidrel and Cetrotide, currently typically cost $5,000 per IVF cycle, the president said.\n \n\n   \n  “As part of this agreement, EMD Serono will list their fertility drugs online at TrumpRx.gov at very, very heavily reduced prices — prices that you won’t even believe,” Trump said, calling the company the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Flanked by officials including Dr. Mehmet Oz, his Medicare and Medicaid administrator, and Republican Alabama Sen. Katie Britt,   Trump also previewed a plan to spur employers to offer more IVF coverage to their employees.\n \n\n   \n  The actions come approximately eight months after Trump’s promise, in a February executive order, to  expand access to IVF  and reduce its cost.\n \n\n   \n   Pfizer  and  AstraZeneca  also signed   agreements in recent weeks with the administration to offer drugs on TrumpRx as part of multipart deals earning reprieves from higher tariffs on imported products.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, the EMD Serono deal would include a reprieve from certain tariffs in exchange for manufacturing and research investment in the US. “We are committed to working with the US administration to add value over the long term, ensuring that our patients and customers continue to have access to and benefit from the innovations within our portfolio,” Belén Garijo, the Merck KGaA CEO, said.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials also noted in a call with reporters that the manufacturer is interested in bringing another fertility medicine to the US market, and could get a speedier review from the Food and Drug Administration as a result of the drug pricing deal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he is encouraging employers to improve IVF access through health insurance plans that offer elective add-on insurance—akin to vision or dental plans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no deeper happiness and joy of raising children, and now millions of Americans struggling with infertility will have a new chance to share the greatest experience of them all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers are not being compelled to offer IVF coverage, nor will there be a requirement for government or insurance company coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The insurance announcement falls well short of a campaign promise Trump made to ensure universal free IVF coverage for those seeking it. “Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” he told supporters at a campaign stop last August.\n \n\n   \n  IVF involves costs beyond drugs and can average between $20,000 and $30,000 per treatment   cycle.  Nearly half of companies  with 500 or more employees covered IVF in their broadest health care plans in 2024, according to a Mercer survey— more than double the number of similar-sized companies that covered IVF in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  However,   smaller companies—those with fewer than 500 employees—are far less likely to offer the benefit,  according to data  from health research nonprofit KFF.\n \n\n   \n  An administration official said they expect employers will want to add on IVF   benefits being proposed by the White House   because it will make them “competitive for talent.”\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 60% of women aged 30 to 44 get their health insurance through their employer, “making this the greatest possible expansion opportunity from a federal action probably ever,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n    Limits to Trump’s IVF plans\n \n\n   \n  In response to the announcement, some reproductive medicine doctors and advocates questioned how extensive new insurance coverage would be and what the impact would be on other widely used fertility drugs.\n \n\n   \n  “Fertility care, including IVF, is health care,” said Dr. Serena Chen, director of advocacy at CCRM Fertility IRMS Reproductive Medicine in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to hear a federal mandate for insurance coverage” for IVF, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was cautiously hopeful about the White House’s promised 84% discount on the three fertility drugs from EMD Serono, noting the company is one of three major makers of commonly used fertility medicines.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously that’s a massive discount, so that I do think is super exciting,” she said. However, she noted that two other companies, Organon and Ferring, are also key makers of these drugs. “What about the other two companies?”\n \n\n   \n  Organon and Ferring did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the other companies in the market make some — but not necessarily all three — of the fertility medicines used in the IVF process, said Dr. David Sable, a former reproductive endocrinologist and current biosciences fund manager. That could make EMD Serono’s agreement with the Trump administration, to offer a heavy discount on their three products together, hard to rival, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet other moves by the Trump administration could hurt families’ access to successful IVF procedures, Sable has argued. In particular, layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this April eliminated a  six-person team  that tracks assisted fertility procedures and potential factors in successful pregnancies.\n \n\n   \n  “If you mandate coverage or make IVF free tomorrow, you need an infrastructure and an ecosystem that actually can take care of all these patients,” Sable said. “We need innovation, we need automation, we need risk management.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-04:00","title":"Takeaways from the first general election debate in the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the first general election debate of the 2025 NYC mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, faced criticism for lacking specific policy details on rent control, free buses, and police reform.

first general election debate in the NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Edward-Isaac Dovere, Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:02 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani was pushed to provide specifics about his plans if he’s elected mayor of New York City in the campaign’s first fall debate, hammered by his two older rivals who painted him as unprepared and accused him of selling the city’s residents a fantasy.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the two hours on stage centered on Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and clear front-runner in the polls. But there were so many back-and-forths that Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, started an answer just 15 minutes into the event by saying: “First of all, there’s high levels of testosterone in this room.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t answer exactly how he would afford his signature policies of  freezing increases on rent-controlled apartments  and making buses free, or how to square  past comments on the police  that he says don’t represent his current views. And he notably declined to back the reelection bid of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul,  one of the few major Democrats  in the state to endorse him.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent  after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary , said Mamdani’s “whole plan is based on a myth” of believing that Albany would pass new taxes to enable his plans. Sliwa called his ideas “fantasies.” But Cuomo had his own struggles to explain what new ideas he would bring to City Hall or the questions about  sexual harassment  and  his handling of Covid-19 in nursing homes  that followed him when he resigned as governor.\n \n\n   \n  “What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity,” Mamdani told Cuomo early on. “What you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.”\n \n\n   \n  Here are CNN’s main takeaways from the debate.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo says if Mamdani wins, NYC’s leader would be ‘Mayor Donald Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and Cuomo traded familiar barbs about the Queens native in the White House. But Cuomo debuted a new line to reflect his belief that President Donald Trump would overpower Mamdani and undermine his authority.\n \n\n   \n  “If the assemblyman is elected, Mayor Donald Trump will take over in New York City, and it will be Mayor Trump,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani responded by accusing Cuomo of being a “coward.” He noted Cuomo  failed to mention Trump  in a statement he issued condemning the Department of Justice’s indictment of State Attorney General Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa were all asked the last time they spoke with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo said he spoke with the president after an assassination attempt last year and again denied a New York Times report that the two had recently spoken about the mayoral race. Sliwa said he hadn’t spoken with Trump in years, saying he had last spoken with Trump years ago about the Veterans Day parade.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if he had ever spoken with Trump, Mamdani answered with a curt “no.” (He did  turn to a Fox News camera  Wednesday to deliver a message directly to Trump.)\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was asked what he would say to Trump in a hypothetical first call if elected mayor. He said he would be willing to speak and work with the president as long as it was focused on issues of affordability.\n \n\n   \n   “I would make it clear to the president that I am willing to not only speak to him, but to work with him if it means delivering on lowering the cost of living for New York,” Mamdani said. “That’s something that he ran his presidential campaign on, and yet, all he’s been able to deliver thus far.”\n \n\n   \n    Israel and Gaza\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a Democratic sensation and as  the party’s politics have broadly shifted against the Israeli government  during the war in Gaza, Mamdani has proactively repeated the opposition to Israel he expressed consistently from college through his time as an assemblyman.\n \n\n   \n  On the debate stage, Mamdani spoke of  the conversations he has had with Jewish New Yorkers  since becoming the Democratic nominee that have opened his eyes to the existence of antisemitism in ways he said he hadn’t fully realized existed and how the phrase “globalize the intifada” could be hurtful. He wouldn’t say whether he believes Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state, saying only that he does not support any country that exists with racial or religious hierarchies.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani also backtracked on an answer he gave just Wednesday on Fox News. Pressed then about whether he would call for Hamas to lay down their weapons, as is called for in the ceasefire agreement, Mamdani said he didn’t have an opinion on the matter beyond following international law. On the debate stage, he did have an opinion: “Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani didn’t respond when Cuomo tried to make a moment of calling on him to denounce Hamas explicitly. He said while he hopes the ceasefire will hold, he will not stop denouncing “the siege, the occupation, and apartheid.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo leapt on that answer, arguing that “the occupation” is a reference to Israel existing at all on the land and saying it’s equivalent to the Hamas-promoted slogan that a future Palestinian state should be “from the river to the sea.” Mamdani rejected that interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani in turn accused Cuomo of fanning anti-Muslim sentiment, arguing that Cuomo never visited a mosque until after losing the primary to him.\n \n\n   \n  “What Muslims want in this city is what every community wants and deserves,” he said. “They want equality and they want respect.”\n \n\n   \n    The forgotten Republican tries to make a mark\n \n\n   \n  The Republican nominee came out swinging.\n \n\n   \n  Free of his  signature red beret , Sliwa leaned into the center-stage spot given to him to go after both of his opponents. He sought to separate himself from the political establishment, at one point countering a question about his lack of political experience by saying, “Thank God I am not a politician.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, best known as the founder of the crime watch group Guardian Angels, focused many of his attacks on Cuomo, questioning his toughness and at one point invoking his father with a particularly sharp zinger.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa alleged that the state parole board when Cuomo was governor released people accused of killing police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “Your father, when he was governor, released none. I knew Mario Cuomo; you’re no Mario Cuomo,” Sliwa said.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is hoping to appeal not just to Republicans but also moderate Democrats unwilling to support Cuomo or Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  He has repeatedly refused to leave the race as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams did, even as Cuomo allies argue Sliwa staying in the race helps Mamdani. Trump has refused to endorse Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa called Mamdani’s ideas “fantasies.” Mamdani generally ignored Sliwa, other than repeatedly correcting the Republican’s mispronunciations of his first name.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani did snap at Sliwa when the Republican told him that “Jews don’t trust that you are going to be there for them when they’re subject to antisemitic attacks.”\n \n\n   \n  “I will be a mayor who finally addresses that, not just the theatrics on this stage,” Mamdani retorted.\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani again apologizes for ripping the police as racist\n \n\n   \n  Since winning June’s Democratic primary, Mamdani  has distanced himself  from tweets referring to police officers as “racist” and “wicked,” though he has a long history of being critical of law enforcement. He’s also  met with police officers and won a notable endorsement  from a former high-ranking New York Police Department official.\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his apology Thursday to New York Police Department officers but also mentioned the names of Black men who have died in police encounters, including the five young men of color who were wrongfully accused and convicted in the Central Park jogger case in 1989.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has tried to draw a contrast between him and Mamdani by proposing to increase the police officer headcount, casting himself as a tough on crime candidate and suggesting Mamdani would be soft.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has proposed creating a Department of Community Safety which would in part dispatch social workers to calls involving people in mental health crises instead of solely relying on police officers.\n \n\n   \n  “He wants to use social workers on domestic violence calls, which are very dangerous, and he’s told you what he thinks,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n    A brewing fight over taxes on millionaires – and a notable non-endorsement\n \n\n   \n  There was a wide range of subjects discussed Thursday that will confront the city’s next mayor, everything from noise complaints to the city’s public school system, the largest in the nation.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani said he would be in favor of changing mayoral control over the school system, a surprising position considering it could limit his authority. Mayoral control allows the mayor near-complete authority over the city’s public school system, centralizing the power with the executive which is in turn seen as being directly accountable for the how the system performs.\n \n\n   \n   Mamdani said he would not give up control in full, saying he wants a participatory system that gives parents and educators increased influence.\n \n\n   \n  He also doubled down on his plan to raise taxes the city’s wealthiest residents despite Hochul’s opposition, saying he believed the same energy that buoyed his underdog campaign would create support for his push to increase taxes.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of people called even my campaign a nonstarter when we first began,” Mamdani said. “Now I stand before you proud to be the Democratic nominee who got the most votes in city primary history, and I believe we will see the same thing with our push to ensure that we are taxing the wealthiest and the most profitable corporations the fair amount that they should pay.”\n \n\n   \n  As mayor, Mamdani would not have the power to raise taxes on his own. He would need the approval of the state legislature and for the governor to sign off on the increase – a politically difficult proposition for any executive, particularly in an election year, which Hochul will be facing next year.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Mamdani declined to endorse Hochul for reelection, saying he was focused on winning the mayoral race, even as Hochul  became one of the first major New York Democrats  to endorse him for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m focusing on November, and I appreciate her support, and I appreciate her work,” Mamdani said when pressed by a moderator.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/us-strikes-suspected-drug-boat-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"20:58:00-04:00","title":"Some survivors after US strikes another suspected drug boat in the Caribbean, sources say","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 16, 2025, the United States conducted a military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, resulting in survivors—marking the first such operation not to instantly kill all on board.

the crew, but their status is unclear.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has carried out at least six  strikes to date  on six separate boats in the Caribbean, but Thursday’s was not made public by the administration – unlike the previous five strikes – and appeared to be the first time an attack had not instantly killed everyone on board.\n \n\n   \n   Reuters  was first to report on Thursday’s strike.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Secretary of Defense did not have an immediate comment. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant,  legal experts previously told CNN , because it appears to justify giving the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review. Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he had also authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying they would have authority to remove President Nicolas Maduro.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/entertainment/ace-frehley-kiss-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"10:49:00-10:49","title":"Ace Frehley, Kiss’ original lead guitarist and founding member, dies at 74","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, has died at age 74 in Morristown, New Jersey. As the first of the original four founding members to pass away, his death marks a significant moment in the band’s legacy. Frehley, known as 'Space Ace' or the 'Spaceman,' was central to Kiss’s theatrical performances, including pyrotechnic guitar effects, and helped shape the band’s identity during their peak in the 1970s. Though he left the band in 1982 and later rejoined in the 1990s, his influence on the glam metal genre—including bands like Mötley Crüe, Poison, and even heavier rock acts such as Metallica and Pantera—is undeniable. He was also praised by contemporaries like Bret Michaels and collaborated with country icon Garth Brooks. Kiss was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, though a dispute over the inclusion of Frehley and drummer Peter Criss delayed the performance. The band’s intellectual property was sold in 2024 to Pophouse Entertainment Group for over $300 million. Frehley’s death is a poignant reminder of the cultural impact of 1970s glam rock and the enduring influence of its original members.","keyTakeAways":["Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and

Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, who captivated audiences with his elaborate galactic makeup and smoking guitar, died Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  He was 74.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, according to his agent.\n \n\n   \n  Family members said in a statement that they are “completely devastated and heartbroken” but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss, whose hits included “Rock and Roll All Nite” and “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” was known for its theatrical stage shows, with fire and fake blood spewing from the mouths of band members dressed in body armor, platform boots, wigs and signature black-and-white face paint.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss’ original lineup included Frehley, singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, tongue-wagging bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss. Frehley’s is the first death among the four founding members.\n \n\n   \n  Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters – Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and the “Spaceman.” The New York-born entertainer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.\n \n\n   \n  “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” Simmons and Stanley said in a joint statement. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS’s legacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Born Paul Daniel Frehley, he grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at age 13. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.\n \n\n   \n  Kiss was especially popular in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to become a marketing marvel. “Beth” was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.\n \n\n   \n  As the Kennedy Center’s new chairman, President Donald Trump named Kiss as one of  this year’s honorees .\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the band sold their catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be over $300 million.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years. He left the band in 1982, missing the years when they took off the makeup and had mixed success. Stanley later said they nearly replaced Frehley with Eddie Van Halen, but Vinnie Vincent assumed the lead guitar role.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley’s Comet.\n \n\n   \n  But he rejoined Kiss in the mid-1990s for a triumphant reunion and restoration of their original style that came after bands including Nirvana, Weezer and the Melvins had expressed affection for the band and paid them musical tributes.\n \n\n   \n  He would leave again in 2002. When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.\n \n\n   \n  Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss “no longer deserve to wear the paint.” “The makeup is earned,” he added. “Just being there at the beginning is not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands including Mötley Crüe and Poison.\n \n\n   \n  “Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we’ve done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,” Poison front man  Bret Michaels  said on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  Harder-edged bands like Metallica and Pantera were also fans, and even country superstar Garth Brooks joined the band members for a recording of their “Hard Luck Woman” on a 1994 compilation.\n \n\n   \n  Frehley would appear occasionally with Kiss for shows in later years. A 2023 concert at Madison Square Garden was  billed as the band’s last.  While Stanley and Simmons said they would not tour again, they’ve been open to the possibility of more concerts, and they’ve stayed active promoting the group’s music and memorabilia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/chicago-car-ramming-case-ice-protests","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-05:00","title":"Federal Vehicle Moved 1,000 Miles from Chicago in Marimar Martinez Ramming Case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a tense legal case stemming from an alleged car ramming incident in Chicago on October 4, 2025, Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, is accused of colliding with a federal law enforcement vehicle during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

I am embarrassed. And I am sorry,” Jones said. “I am sorry to Speaker Gilbert. I am sorry to his family. I am sorry to my family. And I am sorry to every single Virginian.

But now we know what he was doing in the dark.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the debate, Miyares kept a relentless focus on Jones’ text messages — repeatedly invoking their contents to cast doubt on whether he could prosecute crimes against children, deal with parents whose children have died and more.\n \n\n   \n  “Jay, if you were really sorry, then you wouldn’t be running,” Miyares said during the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Jones, meanwhile, sought to redirect the conversation to President Donald Trump, arguing that Miyares couldn’t be trusted to defend Virginians’ interests by taking on the Trump administration in court.\n \n\n   \n  “It is no surprise that President Trump has endorsed Jason for this race — the only statewide elected official to receive that endorsement,” Jones said. “Threw his arm around him and said, ‘He will never let you down.’ And when he says ‘you’ he means Donald Trump, because Donald Trump has spent the last 10 years telling us that he only cares about himself.”\n \n\n   \n  Early voting is already underway. Under Virginia law, there is no way for Jones to formally exit the race at this point without Democrats effectively conceding the attorney general’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, has denounced Jones’ texts — but has left his political fate up to voters. She did not repeat her previous endorsement of Jones in her  recent debate  with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, but she also did not call for Jones to end his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Jones’ texts have become a national story that has dominated headlines ahead of an election in Virginia that is often seen as a barometer of the political mood a year after each presidential election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday said Jones “has appropriately apologized” for his texts and said his remarks have been “condemned across the board by the Democrats” in Virginia and beyond. He did not say whether Jones should stay in the race or not.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Democratic Party chairman Lamont Bagby, who is a state senator, has defended Jones.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve known Jay Jones for years, and I know his family. I know him as a man, and those texts aren’t who he is. And at this point in the commonwealth’s history, we need somebody that’s going to stand up and fight for Virginia’s health care, education and make sure that we stand up for democracy,” Bagby said.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, could represent Republicans’ best chance of a statewide victory in Virginia this fall. He won the attorney general’s office in 2021, ousting Democratic incumbent Mark Herring — a year in which Jones lost the Democratic primary to Herring. Miyares has often waded into cultural battles over gender identity and schools — an issue that Earle-Sears has made the centerpiece of her message this year.\n \n\n   \n  The debate covered a range of issues that have been focal points in Virginia’s elections — including  utility costs , transgender policies, drug prices, fentanyl prosecutions and the  government shutdown  — which has major ramifications in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, where the federal government is a massive employer. But Miyares also peppered his comments with references to Jones’ texts throughout the debate.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, who was also in the Legislature at the time the texts were sent, recalled Gilbert’s wife bringing their two young children to the General Assembly, and the children running through the halls.\n \n\n   \n  “This wasn’t a hypothetical. This wasn’t some figure that you know from far away. You actually know Todd. This is a flesh-and-blood, real husband. Jennifer is a real mom. These are real kids,” Miyares said. “How in the world could you ever show compassion and comfort a grieving mother that has ever lost a child to violence?”\n \n\n   \n  Jones pointed to Republican figures’ own controversial comments.\n \n\n   \n  “What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones said, referring to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n  Jones added: “I have taken accountability for my mistakes. It’s time you take accountability, too.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/illinois-judge-trump-chicago-protesters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00-04:00","title":"Federal judge demands answers from Trump admin on following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee, expanded her temporary restraining order against federal immigration and border enforcement agents in Chicago, requiring all agents in Operation Midway Blitz to wear body cameras during protests.

following order to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters \n       \n  By Andy Rose, Bill Kirkos, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 PM EDT, Thu October 16, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The sign outside the door said Courtroom 1403. But inside, it felt a lot more like the principal’s office.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” US District Judge Sara Ellis said Thursday in a stern tone no student – or attorney – wants to hear. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  One week after the judge issued a  sweeping order  trying to calm the intense response of federal agents to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Border Patrol activities in Chicago, Ellis told both sides to come back to her courtroom to have their own intense discussion.\n \n\n   \n  “I live in Chicago, if folks haven’t noticed, and I’m not blind, right?” Ellis opened the hearing. “So, I don’t live in a cave. I have a phone. I have a TV. I have a computer and I tend to get news.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge said those news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration may not be following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” said Ellis  from the bench.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Ellis announced Thursday she will expand her restraining order, requiring all federal agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz and who have body cameras to have them on during encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The judge initially required all agents to wear cameras, but agreed to some flexibility after Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, said it would be logistically impossible to immediately equip all agents with bodycams.\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Justice still opposed the body cam order, arguing it’s not a simple matter to record the body cam videos and consistently turn them around for reviewing and redacting video based on every allegation.\n \n\n   \n  “It would require a tremendous amount of resources,” Skedzielewski said.\n \n\n   \n    Order limited use of riot control weapons and tactics\n \n\n   \n  Ellis –  an Obama appointee  – issued a temporary restraining order last week after a coalition of local journalists and protesters sued the Trump administration, saying federal law enforcement agents were targeting people engaging in peaceful activity, including multiple reporters who said they had pepper balls fired on them despite being identified as press.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the plaintiffs said they believe agents violated the order, including a  confrontation  on Chicago’s southeast side Tuesday after a traffic accident involving US Border Patrol, which ended with agents using tear gas against an angry crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” said the judge, suggesting the tense situation resulted from Border Patrol agents using tactics not appropriate in the nation’s third-largest city.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not on the border. We are in an urban, densely populated area where crowds are going to converge when there’s a commotion, where appropriate crowd control is important,” she said. “Trying to apprehend and detain people is very, very different when you’re in an urban setting than when you’re out on the border.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis demanded that ICE Field Director Russell Hott appear in court on Monday at 10:30 a.m. local time, “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” It is unclear if Hott will appear in person or via a video link.\n \n\n   \n  The original restraining order from Ellis blocks agents from targeting journalists who are not interfering with law enforcement. Federal agents are also prohibited from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on anyone who does not impose an “immediate threat to safety.”\n \n\n   \n  “The issue is that DHS is using force in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of peaceful protesters, journalists and, essentially, clergy members,” said the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t shoot ‘em in the head (with pepper balls),” Ellis said, addressing a list of things federal agents have been accused of doing in encounters with demonstrators. “You can’t deploy tear gas. You can’t use flash-bang grenades. You can’t drive a car through a crowd.”\n \n\n   \n  Video of a pastor being  repeatedly shot  by pepper balls during a demonstration outside at an ICE facility near Chicago earlier this month drew widespread outcry.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration agents nationally have expressed reluctance about body cameras\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys on both sides of the Chicago case are waiting for details on how the body camera order will work there. The topic has at times led to friction between immigration agents and FBI agents assigned to assist with enforcement efforts across the country, two law enforcement sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  While FBI agents have worn body cameras during joint arrest operations per their agency’s policy, some immigration agents not wearing body cameras expressed concern to their FBI counterparts about having their tactics recorded, sources said. During one heated exchange, immigration agents who did not want to be captured on body camera footage refused to invite FBI agents along for an arrest operation, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, law enforcement sources said the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed by immigration agents have, at times, led to other confrontations in recent months between the Department of Homeland Security and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.\n \n\n   \n  In at least two FBI field office divisions, sources who were not authorized to speak publicly said agents assigned to work on immigration matters raised concerns with their management over what they believed to be questionable tactics by DHS, such as entering private property without permission and racial profiling.\n \n\n   \n    Government says judge is seeing “selectively edited” reports\n \n\n   \n  Skedzielewski suggested the news coverage that prompted the judge’s anger may be misleading, saying Ellis is relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis acknowledged some details in news reports may be under dispute, adding that is why she wants to speak to the field director on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker – who is not a party to the lawsuit – said Thursday he was pleased by the judge’s decision to expand her order and that agents should be wearing body cameras “because they clearly lie about what goes on.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re going to see more cases brought against ICE and (Customs and Border Protection),” Pritzer added.\n \n\n   \n  Asked recently about tactics used by immigration agents, DHS said  in a statement  to CNN that federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”\n \n\n   \n  In a loss for the Trump administration, an appellate court on Thursday denied the government’s effort to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  However, the troops can remain in the state under federal control, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion details the court’s reasoning in a  decision  issued Saturday and comes a week after US District Court Judge April Perry issued a scathing  oral ruling  from Chicago that granted a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration’s deployment of soldiers in Illinois for two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois” that would justify federalizing National Guard soldiers, Perry said, calling Department of Homeland Security assessments of the protests “unreliable.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577704","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"No Kings Protests: Nationwide Rally Against Trump Administration Policies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Saturday, October 18, 2025, demonstrators across the United States participated in a nationwide No Kings rally, protesting the policies of the Trump Administration.

Bowman \n        \n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         One of the biggest days of protest against the Trump administration's policies happened on Saturday in cities around the U.S. The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official. It marked the  second massive wave of protests  organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda. Organizers said about 2,600 No Kings events were planned across nearly every state, and that it projected a bigger turnout than the 5 million it said attended its previous nationwide action in June. Energized by a slew of actions taken by the administration since the summer protests, the group cited widespread  immigration detentions  carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal  education resources  and  environmental protections ,  gerrymandering  and other concerns. Here's a recap of how the protests unfolded. 1. United in protests to 'protect America' Protesters showed up to oppose a wide range of issues, including the administration's immigration tactics and its push for federal and military intervention in Democratic-led states as a way to tackle crime. The diversity of concerns was strung together by the broader messaging of democracy, constitutional rights and the freedom the U.S. was founded on. In Washington, D.C., demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read \"No Kings, No Tyrants.\" Many people wore yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity. Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR \"we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.\" \"This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,\" Kitchen said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats,  addressed D.C. protesters  in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president. Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg \"and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.\" On the West Coast in San Pablo, Calif., Maria Floriano attended a No Kings event with immigration on her mind. Wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies, she compared immigration to butterflies and said \"migration is beautiful\" and \"an act of courage.\" \"We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here,\" Floriano said, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants. 2. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers weighed in House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed Saturday's protests as a \" hate America rally ,\" and other Republicans have derided the event as anti-American. Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\" Trump was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Connecticut House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora  told Connecticut Public  that he considered the \"No Kings\" messaging of the protests \"divisive.\" He also doesn't share protesters' concerns but supports their right to exercise their First Amendment rights. \"I think our democracy is still strong as ever — but, you know, they're free to express themselves,\" Candelora said. 3. Peaceful protesting with song and dance Despite the many criticisms that anti-Trump protesters came to preach, there were displays of optimism, hope and whimsy in several cities. Inspired by  protesters in Portland, Ore. , people in  Los Angeles ,  Hartford, Conn. , and elsewhere showed up to march in inflatable animal costumes. Song and dance broke out in  Salt Lake City  and other cities. As with the previous mass No Kings protests, revolutionary messaging showed up in demonstrators' clothing, chants and signs as protesters sought to remind people that America was founded in opposition to monarchy. In Macon, Ga., protesters belted  \"The Story of Tonight\" from the musical  Hamilton  — a song about the importance of sacrifice and solidarity today for the sake of freedom tomorrow. The protests were largely peaceful. Police in New York City and Washington, D.C., where rallies drew some of the day's biggest crowds, said no protest-related arrests were made. Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas mobilized their states' National Guards in preparation for the protests. \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to  VPM . The Texas Newsroom  reported  that Abbott said in a statement of sending the Guards to Austin: \"Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas.\" The newsroom also reported that state troopers were stationed at entrances to the Capitol grounds inspecting bags but protesters said the law enforcement presence felt smaller than  the previous \"No Kings\" event in June . Saturday's rally was peaceful and there were no arrests,  according to the Austin Police Department.

          Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Most of the effects of the ongoing government shutdown are far-removed from the halls of Congress. But the situation facing one group of federal employees who are working without pay is difficult for lawmakers to overlook: The Capitol Police officers who protect them every day. The officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10th. \"They're asked to be everything to everybody,\" said Terry Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief. \"You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also have to be a person who will welcome visitors and be a tour guide.\" Gainer says the job is tougher than ever, as public officials face growing threats and violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gesturing toward two officers guarding the ornate Senate Reception Room, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she feels for the force's more than 2,000 officers and that Democrats are to blame for the impasse. \"These men and women are paying the price,\" Britt said. \"It's absolutely selfish and ridiculous. It's heartbreaking. People have mortgages, they have families.\" Officer Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chair, called on lawmakers last week to end the shutdown, writing in a statement that \"Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass.\" Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who sits on the House committee that oversees the force, says he has kept in touch with Papathanasiou and Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan. \"What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all and yet we're walking among people who are directly impacted by this,\" Morelle said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has signaled  plans to repurpose funds  to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, though Democrats have questioned the legality of the moves. \"I'm not unhappy with that result if it's the case,\" Morelle said. \"But I'm still mindful of the fact that what the president is talking about, whether it's military troops or law enforcement, it's patently illegal,\" he said. Morelle says the missed checks are not the only slight, saying officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose  President Trump's pardons of rioters  who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th. He notes a Jan. 6 memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol  is still uninstalled  on Capitol Hill, despite a federally-mandated deadline. \"We've always stood with Capitol police and law enforcement and we've shown that in word and deed,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters last week. \"All of a sudden after all of these issues where they have been frankly insulting to members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, 'Oh well, we really care about them,\" Morelle said. Gainer, the former Capitol Police chief, said officers continue to do their jobs with professionalism, but each slight makes it more difficult to convince them that the long hours and personal risk are worth staying for. Last week, Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif.,   briefly clashed with an officer  during a protest, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology. Barragán said the officer grabbed her as she tried to enter Johnson's office. \"One of the skill sets we require of police officers is your ability to remember, because you're good witnesses,\" Gainer said. \"So your memory doesn't get erased, but what you try to do is reset the clock.\" Asked this week whether they were holding up during the shutdown, a group of officers said they were — \"for now.\" But one officer had an addendum to that assessment. \"Give it a month, maybe not,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578871","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"04:02:00-04:00","title":"After Zelenskyy meeting, Trump calls on Ukraine and Russia to 'stop where they are' and end the war","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a lengthy meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump urged both Ukraine and Russia to 'stop where they are' and end the war, marking a significant shift from his earlier support for Ukraine reclaiming all lost territory.

Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" Later, soon after arriving in Florida, where he's spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to \"stop the war immediately\" and implied that Moscow keep territory it's taken from Kyiv. \"You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it's too complicated,\" Trump told reporters. \"You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.\" The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by Trump. In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war. After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Zelenskyy after Friday's meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. He sidestepped directly answering a question about Trump nudging Ukraine to give up land. \"The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak,\" Zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about Trump's social media post, which he hadn't seen. Another change in tone Trump's tone on the war shifted after he held a lengthy phone call with Putin on Thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks. The president also signaled to Zelenskyy on Friday that he's leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table. Zelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a \"proposition\" in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the Tomahawk cruise missiles. But Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia's invasion. \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace,\" Trump said. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We'd much rather have the war be over to be honest.\" In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed. \"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" he said. Zelenskyy also said \"we need Tomahawks\" because \"it's very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.\" Trump's latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship. Why Tomahawks? But following Thursday's call with Putin, Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) Zelenskyy had been seeking the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump's calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously. Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks \"won't change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,\" according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser. It was the fifth face-to-face meeting for Trump and Zelenskyy since the Republican returned to office in January, The president said Friday it was \"to be determined\" if Zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in Hungary — suggesting a \"double meeting\" with the warring countries' leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations. \"These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump added. But Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin \"is not about feelings.\" \"They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don't intend to stop,\" Zelenskyy added. \"So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. Undoubtedly.\" Trump, going back to his 2024 campaign, insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in August, when he held a summit with Putin in Alaska and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies. Trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. But the Russian leader hasn't shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine. Asked Friday if he was concerned that Putin was stringing him along, Trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the Russian leader. \"I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" Trump said. He added, \"I think I'm pretty good at this stuff.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558451","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"A caregiver's survival guide: Advice from people who've been there","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article from NPR, published on October 18, 2025, offers practical advice and emotional support to caregivers of ill or elderly adults, based on insights from nearly 600 caregivers who shared their experiences.

You're likely becoming both a patient advocate and a medical coordinator — two jobs with steep learning curves. Here's what other caregivers have learned. The new normal: This isn't the life I planned. How do I adjust? Caregiving is now your new normal. But fully accepting and adjusting to this changed reality can take a while. Often, it comes in waves — periods of calm interrupted by wild turmoil.  Here are tips for enduring these times. Help! How to ask for (and accept) support The No. 1 piece of advice from other caregivers: Get help, whether from a support group, a friend, other family, a therapist, your church, or all of the above. Caregiving is too hard and too isolating to do it on your own. As one caregiver put it, most people start the job as if it were a sprint and only slowly realize they're in a marathon. Try these caregivers' tips for getting the help you need. Self-care: It's essential and it's not what you think  It's not spa days and yoga classes. Real self-care means learning how to protect your mental and physical health despite the crushing demands on your time. Often, that starts with setting boundaries and forgiving yourself.  Explore what's worked for other caregivers. Your new relationship: Dealing with a changing dynamic You're no longer just a partner, spouse, parent or child. Now, you're also a caregiver, and that changes your relationship with your loved one in ways that can be hard to detect and difficult to adjust to.

The map, aimed at shifting power toward Republicans by targeting Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II’s Kansas City district, has sparked widespread public resentment. The group is collecting over 100,000 signatures to place a referendum on the ballot in 2026, allowing voters to decide whether to keep or reject the map. State officials, including Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, have contested the referendum, claiming it violates constitutional law, though Hoskins recently approved it after initial rejection. Progressive candidate Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan and other residents argue that the redistricting undermines local representation and worsens existing issues like affordable housing, mental health, and transportation. While most Republicans support the new map, 15—including Speaker Jon Patterson and Rep. Bill Allen—oppose it, citing concerns about district integrity and representation.

     These voters want to overturn Missouri's new gerrymandered congressional map \n         By Savannah Hawley-Bates \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 9:21 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Lately, on any given day, you'll find Leann Villaluz knocking on doors around Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide the fate of the state's new congressional map. \"There's a sense of resentment, even to regular voters who aren't as involved,\" Villaluz says. \"We have to pick up the slack for representatives who have been elected to do their simple duty and carry out the will of the voters. Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\" Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a  nationwide redistricting battle  in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by  redistricting in favor of Democrats , if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month. Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City. But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it. The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent  Chappell Roan concert  to get signatures. \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\" Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back  Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway  filed a lawsuit in federal court  arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after  initially rejecting it . But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid. \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\" The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval. \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\" The  Democratic National Committee  has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A  slew of lawsuits  have also been filed challenging the new districts. A legal effort, too  Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional. \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\" Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult. \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\" Most, but not all Republicans, are on board Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session. Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right. Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\" But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts. Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so. \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\" Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map. \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\" Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579045","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"15:38:00-04:00","title":"2 Survivors of Suspected Drug Vessel Will Be Sent to Home Countries, Trump Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military conducted a strike on a suspected drug-carrying submersible vessel in the Caribbean, resulting in the deaths of at least 29 people across six attacks since early September 2025.

sentence of George Santos \n         By Saige Miller \n        \n           Updated Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:47 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump announced on Friday that he commuted the prison term of George Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes after he was expelled from the House over accusations that he stole money from campaign donors. Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately. Joseph Murray, one of Santos' lawyers,  told The Associated Press  that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J., around 11 p.m. Friday, and was greeted by his family. \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote. Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year. Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances. His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114  to remove him from office . Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos. The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos  was facing 23 criminal charges . Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago  about his military service . Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote. So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of  more than 1,500 people  charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received  a pardon  after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5532087","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:43:00-18:00","title":"Why more parents are riding cargo bikes, skipping the minivan","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of cargo bike use among U.S. parents, particularly in cities with growing cycling infrastructure.

Some families are ditching their second car, forgoing a minivan, or going car-free altogether. Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century — and they're popular elsewhere on the globe. But until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. Now they're making a comeback. There are a few reasons behind the surge in cargo bike ridership, including better bicycle infrastructure, and bikes that are easy to ride, even if you're not an athlete. Lelac Almagor was not a biker before she bought her cargo bike. \"I'm a very lazy person,\" Almagor says. She thought she'd give the bike a try, and probably return it. \"But by the third day I was like, 'Oh, this is actually going to change my life,'\" says Almagor, who lives in Washington, D.C. Now she rides her three kids to school every day, even when it's pouring rain or hot and muggy. \"It's such a better start to my day, that now there's truly not weather that I would rather drive in,\" Almagor says. She bought the bike six years ago — back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens crowding the bike racks, not to mention the riders she sees heading to other schools. Almagor got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. Bikes designed to carry kids Today's cargo bikes are designed specifically for transporting kids, with comfy seats and rain canopies, and, importantly, electric motors. Philip Koopman, a longtime D.C. bike shop owner, says there were no electric cargo bikes when his kids were young. He toted them around around the city in a trailer behind his bike, muscling up hills. \"Most people don't want to be sweaty when they get to work,\" Koopman says. \"So having these different options, it just makes cycling so much more attainable for so many more people.\" On a recent Saturday, Koopman was helping people test ride cargo bikes at the  DC Family Bike Fest . The event drew hundreds of parents, including Patricia Stamper, who was trying out different bikes with her two kids. \"I'm 39, I'm losing weight, I need some help,\" Stamper says. \"And this is cheaper than bariatric surgery, it's cheaper than Wegovy.\" The bike she's eyeing is pricey, at around $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it, to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work and go shopping. While cargo bikes are expensive, riders point out they're much cheaper than cars, especially when you account for gas, insurance, parking and maintenance. Better bike infrastructure The first protected bike lane in the U.S. — separated from car traffic — was installed in 1967 in Davis, Calif. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such lanes can be found all over the country. Minneapolis is  often ranked  as the best cycling city in the nation, with more than 200 miles of bike lanes and trails. \"If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes,\" says Laura Mitchell, who lives in the city. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a \"game changer\" for her family. So, earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free, to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. People aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. Unlike Minneapolis, Houston is often near the bottom of bike rankings.  Brian Jackson, who lives in Houston, frequently drops off his two kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school and daycare. He gets a lot of quizzical looks. \"A lot of people are like, 'I've never seen anything like it,'\" Jackson says. Jackson does see a few other cargo-bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. He says Houston has a \"secret strong bike culture,\" and drivers usually give him plenty of space, especially when they see the kids on board. A second bicycle boom Since the very first bicycles, people jerry rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike — at least in North America and Europe — was about a century ago. Back then, cities were buzzing with workmen on bicycles. \"There'd be knife sharpeners with a little studio set up on the back of their bikes. There were glaziers — people who fixed broken windows,\" says Jody Rosen, author of the book  Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle . It all started with the Great Bicycle Boom of the 1890s. Rosen says now we're in a new, 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. Lelac Almagor, the D.C. cargo bike mom, says she thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the e-bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them. That makes it seem normal — just a practical way to get around with your kids. The very best advertisement for cargo biking, she says? The carpool line at school. \"When the car line is wrapping around the block, just gliding past in our little flotilla of cargo bikes. There's no way, as a parent, not to be like, 'maybe we should do that.'\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   You may have noticed more parents hauling their children around on bulky bicycles. I mean, who needs a minivan? Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century, but until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. NPR's Jacob Fenston set out to learn why they're making a comeback. JACOB FENSTON, BYLINE: It's a school day morning, and Lelac Almagor is shuffling her kids out of the house in Washington, D.C. The 6-year-old is staying home sick. But the other two head for the bike. LELAC ALMAGOR: My kids are very, very slowly climbing into the bike, and soon - I hope - they're going to put their seat belts and helmets on so that we can go to school and be on time. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Going as fast as I can. ALMAGOR: Well, whoever's first is going to get to pick the music. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: OK. FENSTON: Technically, it's a tricycle - two wheels in the front and, in between, a big wooden box where the kids sit. ALMAGOR: All right. You ready? FENSTON: She pilots through narrow bike lanes and then on a path next to the train tracks. Finally, she stops at a red light next to the school. Is this the carpool situation? ALMAGOR: Yeah. It lines up all the way around the block that way. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE BLOWING) FENSTON: The carpool lane - parents sitting in cars and SUVs and gnarled traffic on a hectic four-lane road. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) FENSTON: Almagor says this is the best advertisement for riding a cargo bike. ALMAGOR: On those first couple days of school, when the car line is, like, wrapping around the block, just, like, gliding past in our, like, little flotilla of cargo bikes, and it's like, there's no way not to - as a parent, not to be like, maybe you should do that. FENSTON: She bought her bike six years ago. Back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens. She got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. There seem to be a few reasons for the surge in popularity. One is the bikes themselves - much easier to ride, even if you're not an athlete. PHILIP KOOPMAN: With your feet flat on the ground, not on the saddle. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. KOOPMAN: And push forward, and the kickstand will pop up there. Just push ahead. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Push ahead. KOOPMAN: There you go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. FENSTON: Philip Koopman is a longtime bike shop owner in D.C. On a recent Saturday, he was helping people test ride cargo bikes at a family bike festival in the city. It drew hundreds of parents and kids. Koopman says, for serious cyclists, biking with kids is nothing new. KOOPMAN: My kids are 29 and 32. And there was, back then, no such thing as electric motors or cargo bikes. They spent thousands of miles in a Burley trailer. FENSTON: What's different now is the technology, bikes designed specifically for transporting kids with comfy seats and rain canopies and, importantly, electric motors. KOOPMAN: Most people don't feel comfortable or they don't want to have - you know, be sweaty when they get to work. So having these different options, it just makes cycling attainable for so many more people. FENSTON: People like Patricia Stamper (ph). She was at the festival with her two kids, trying out different bikes. PATRICIA STAMPER: I'm 39. I'm losing weight. I need some help. And, yeah - and this is cheaper than bariatric surgery. So I really appreciate it. And it's cheaper than Wegovy. FENSTON: Bike she's eyeing is pricey - $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work, go shopping. STAMPER: I live in a food desert. There's only, like, two grocery stores for 90,000 people. So I would like other options to be able to venture out in the city, and parking's atrocious. FENSTON: Another reason more people are riding cargo bikes - there's better bike infrastructure. The first protected bike lane in the U.S. - separated from car traffic - was installed in 1967 in Davis, California. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such protected lanes can be found all over the country. Laura Mitchell lives in Minneapolis, often ranked as the best cycling city in the U.S. LAURA MITCHELL: If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes. FENSTON: That's especially true for parents braving traffic with young kids. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a game changer for her family. So earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. MITCHELL: The demand has been much, much higher than we've been able to meet. FENSTON: But people aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. BRIAN JACKSON: I am Brian Jackson (ph), and I live in Houston. FENSTON: Jackson often drops off his kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school in daycare. He does see a few other cargo bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. JACKSON: A lot of people are - have never seen anything like it. They're like, what on earth is that? They always ask, like, did you make that yourself? FENSTON: Since the very first bicycles, people jerry-rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike, at least in North America and Europe, was about a century ago. Jody Rosen is author of the book \"Two Wheels Good: The History And Mystery Of The Bicycle.\" He says cities back then were buzzing with workmen on bikes. JODY ROSEN: There'd be knife sharpeners with kind of, like, a little studio set up on the back of their bike. There were glazers, people who fixed, you know, broken windows. FENSTON: There were bakers bikes and butchers bikes, he says, mail bikes and milk bikes. It all started with the great bicycle boom of the 1890s. ROSEN: This is when bikes became much cheaper and widely adapted by regular old folks as a means of transportation. FENSTON: Now, he says, we're in a new 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. ALMAGOR: You know I have your backpack, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Oh, yeah. FENSTON: Back in D.C., Lelac Almagor says goodbye to her kids as they climb out of her trike. The 4-mile ride to school took about 20 minutes, probably faster than driving. ALMAGOR: Have a good day. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's really gross. FENSTON: She thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them, whether it's school or the local park. Back when she bought her giant trike, she'd never actually seen one in real life. ALMAGOR: It was this, like, bizarre thing I had seen on the internet. I wasn't even sure if it was real or if it would come if I ordered it. Right? I think it's very different if every birthday party you go to has, like, 20 cargo bikes of all different shapes and sizes. FENSTON: That makes it seem normal, she says - just a practical way to get around with your kids.

Stars from Goldie Hawn to Bette Midler to Steve Martin expressed their love of the actor after hearing the news, paying tribute to “just a truly original person,” as Reese Witherspoon put it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to believe,” said Jane Fonda in a tribute.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was 79, and her cause of her death was  later revealed  to be from bacterial pneumonia, according to a death certificate obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told CNN that they received a call for medical assistance on Saturday morning at Keaton’s address and paramedics transferred a person to a hospital. A law enforcement source confirmed the person transported was Keaton.\n \n\n   \n   Keaton  was a celebrated and prolific actor whose career spanned decades, early on earning an Academy Award in the best actress category for 1977’s “Annie Hall.” The film showcased Keaton’s abilities in the realm of comedy but also displayed her nimble handling of authentic and vulnerable moments.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, “Annie Hall” introduced filmgoers to Keaton’s matchless and gender-nonconforming sense of style – immediately identifiable by her use of men’s slacks, vests and hats. Decidedly ahead of her time from a fashion perspective, Keaton maintained a commitment to this sartorial mix well into her older years.\n \n\n   \n  An undeniable comedic talent who said in 1997 that she’s “more inclined to live comfortably in the world of humor,” Keaton nonetheless also made her mark in a number of dramatic movies – including a pivotal role in Francis Ford Coppola’s acclaimed “Godfather” films, in which she played Kay, wife to Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone.\n \n\n   \n    Starting out\n \n\n   \n  Keaton, who bore no relation to Buster or Michael, was born Diane Hall in 1946 in Los Angeles. In a 2004 “Fresh Air” podcast, she talked about how her mother, a homemaker and amateur photographer, won pageants and became Mrs. Highland Park and later Mrs. Los Angeles, which first gave her the urge to perform.\n \n\n   \n  “I did want to go on stage, I saw that that was something that did appeal to me,” she said. “There she was in the theater, and I saw the curtain open and there was my mother, and I thought, ‘Hm, I think I’d like that for myself.’”\n \n\n   \n  After finding her place on the theater stage in the late 1960s in a Broadway production of “Hair” – in which she gained some notoriety for declining to perform nude for one of the musical numbers and thereby forewent a sizable (at the time) $50 bonus – Keaton burst onto the film scene with the first “Godfather” film in 1972, going on to appear in several films throughout the decade opposite the writer and director Woody Allen, who was also her romantic partner around that time.\n \n\n   \n  The films they acted in together include Allen’s “Sleeper” and “Play It Again Sam,” but it was her star turn in “Annie Hall,” in which she played the joyous and carefree titular character who falls in love with Allen’s bumbling, self-hating comedian, that would prove most memorable.\n \n\n   \n    Leading lady\n \n\n   \n  From there, Keaton enjoyed leading star-status in a fair share of notable films, including 1977’s “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” and 1981’s “Reds” opposite Warren Beatty, a film that scored multiple Oscar nods including another one for her.\n \n\n   \n  Another classic film starring Keaton from the ’80s era was 1987’s “Baby Boom,” which featured her as a high-powered ad exec who suddenly finds herself saddled with the infant of a dead long-lost relative. The fish-out-of-water comedy costarred Sam Shepard and reminded audiences of Keaton’s deft skills at leading a movie that mixed the funny with the dramatic and thought-provoking.\n \n\n   \n  The 1990s saw Keaton team up with her contemporary Hollywood powerhouses Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn for the hit 1996 comedy “First Wives Club,” about a trio of women who exact artful revenge on their husbands after the men leave them for younger women. Raking in $181 million at the domestic box office, “First Wives” was welcome proof that a successful film didn’t exclusively have to include explosions or aliens, and could even be led by three women in their 50s.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the decade, Keaton earned a third Oscar nom for the tearjerker “Marvin’s Room,” in which she starred opposite Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film tells the story of an estranged pair of sisters who reunite to grapple with their past as well as the onset of illness.\n \n\n   \n    Far from slowing down\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was featured in several more acclaimed movies in the aughts – including the 2003 rom-com “Something’s Gotta Give” opposite Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves, in which she scored her fourth lead actor Academy Award nod – as well as “The Family Stone” from 2005, a modern-day Christmas classic with Keaton in the role of a matriarch who unwittingly helps her children find the partners they belong with.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, she appeared in “Book Club” in 2018, alongside Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen, as well as its 2023 sequel.\n \n\n   \n  She also starred in the comedy “Summer Camp” alongside Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard last year and had a few titles in the works – including a film with Blake Lively and Richard Gere, according to her IMDb.\n \n\n   \n  Keaton was also an accomplished producer and director. She helmed the acclaimed 1995 drama “Unstrung Heroes” starring Andie MacDowell, as well as “Hanging Up” in 2000. Her producing credits span over 30 years, with the most recent being an executive producer credit on 2023’s “Maybe I Do,” which starred Keaton, Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Emma Roberts.\n \n\n   \n    Unapologetically independent\n \n\n   \n  Keaton never married, and had been outspoken about her thinking on the topic, saying it goes back to her mother, as “most everything does.”\n \n\n   \n  “She had four kids, and I was the firstborn. I saw how much she gave up,” Keaton said in a 2021 piece for Interview. “I feel like she chose family over her dreams. And she was just the best mother, but I think that she is the reason why I didn’t get married. I didn’t want to give up my independence.”\n \n\n   \n  With her trademark humor, Keaton added, “By the way, no one has ever asked me to marry them, either, so that might be a good answer. I should’ve started with that and called it a day.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton is survived by her two children, daughter Dexter, and son Duke. She adopted them both in her 50s.\n \n\n   \n  “The shocking thing is that I worry differently now,” Keaton told Life Magazine in 2005 about how motherhood changed her. “Before kids, if I worried, it was only about myself, but that’s all you do is worry as a parent. It’s rule number one in parenting: secretly worry without letting the kids know you’re worried.”\n \n\n   \n  When she was 69, Keaton told AARP Magazine, “At this age, everything seems much more astonishing. Like, Oh my goodness, look at that sycamore tree! Why didn’t I see that before? There’s a magical aspect, a wonder, to being on this planet.”\n \n\n   \n  Keaton’s death was first reported by People magazine. CNN has reached out to her representatives, who have not replied. Producer Dori Rath, who worked with Keaton, confirmed the actress had died to CNN on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5574349","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Does the sale of Dominion Voting Systems mean a transformation?

Depends who's asking \n         By Miles Parks, Bente Birkeland \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         When Scott Leiendecker announced he was buying Dominion Voting Systems — the elections technology company at the heart of countless 2020 election  conspiracy theories  — he teased a transformation. \"As of today, Dominion is gone,\" read the first line of a press release that seemed to many readers to  lean into  the unfounded rumors that have swirled around the company (and led to  hundreds of millions of dollars  in defamation settlements) since Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. \"We are turning the page and beginning the vital work of restoring faith in American elections,\" Leiendecker wrote in a public letter posted on the website for his new company, Liberty Vote. But in private, when speaking to the company's county election official customers, the messaging has been different, raising the question of how much the company plans to change. \"Feel assured that Liberty Vote shares the same values as Dominion,\" company representatives in Georgia, which has a statewide contract with the company, wrote in an email that NPR reviewed that was sent to counties after the sale was announced. \"Same team, same support, different name.\" In Colorado, where Dominion was headquartered and where 60 of 64 counties have a contract with the company, Molly Fitzpatrick, who's the Democratic Boulder County clerk, talked with Leiendecker shortly after the sale and helped facilitate another call to include every clerk in the state. \"He reiterated that he is an elections person and he has a long track record of being involved in elections,\" Fitzpatrick said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After serving as a Republican elections director in St. Louis 20 years ago, Leiendecker started a company, KNOWiNK, in 2011 that has become the United States' largest vendor for voter check-in technology. And while the message on Liberty Vote's website notes KNOWiNK's ubiquity in U.S. elections, the Liberty Vote press release doesn't mention KNOWiNK and paints Leiendecker as more of an outsider, referring to him as a \"nationally recognized election reform advocate.\" Leiendecker did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. A press release's partisan tone The press release announcing the Dominion sale nodded at conservative election priorities, highlighting Liberty Vote's 100% American ownership and a mission to \"restore public confidence in the electoral process through transparent, secure, and trustworthy voting systems, including the use of hand-marked paper ballots.\" Liberty Vote also promised to comply with Trump's March executive order on election security, which has  largely been paused by federal judges . David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said that he couldn't remember an election vendor ever seeking out publicity in the way Liberty Vote did and that the partisan tone of the announcement may generate even more suspicion around the company than existed before. \"I thought the announcement was weird — I'll be honest,\" Becker said. \"That just raised a lot of questions on the part of election officials. They're already under siege. There is already so much disinformation swirling about voting systems and their security. … They don't want drama around their voting systems.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some in the voting world see the difference in the public and private messaging as more of a rebrand aimed at capitalizing on doubts that people have about elections, rather than transforming the company into a partisan entity. As one state voting official, who was not authorized to speak about the sale publicly, put it to NPR: \"[Leiendecker] sees an opportunity to sell Dominion to all the conservative jurisdictions who wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole the past five years.\" \"It's all business for him,\" the official said. \"Is this a GOP takeover?\" Some Colorado clerks were frustrated they were given no notice before the sale was made public. \"There was no notification to us that this was even a conversation,\" said Tiffany Lee, the politically unaffiliated clerk of La Plata County, in southwest Colorado. \"That's concerning to me that we didn't get any kind of information from [Liberty Vote] directly or Dominion.\" The announcement — along with Leiendecker's history as a Republican elections official — raised questions for some voters as well, Lee said: \"It was, 'Is this a GOP takeover? Are elections going away? What's happening?' Probably one of the biggest questions I've overall gotten is, 'Are we gonna continue to have elections?'\" Lee and other election officials are urging calm, considering that nothing about the equipment used to scan and count votes is even changing in the short term. In most cases, voters whose ballots were tallied using Dominion technology in 2024 will have their votes counted in the 2026 midterms using the same machines. \"From a security and technical perspective, everything still stands,\" Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, said. \"We still have multiple checks and balances to demonstrate and verify the integrity of the system. Everything that we have been saying for years is still the same.\" The sale may not satisfy conspiracy theorists Like  most of the country , Colorado is a paper-ballot state, and by law, all Colorado counties conduct risk-limiting audits after each election, double-checking the scanning machines' tallies against the actual votes on the original paper ballots. While audits and hand counts have shown that the state's election results are accurate, Colorado has been at the  epicenter of false election claims . That fact has many wondering whether a marketing campaign can actually win the buy-in of those convinced that Dominion was involved in stealing elections. Indeed, after the sale was announced, conservative activist and podcaster Joe Oltmann, a prominent election denier based in Colorado, blasted Leiendecker in a Facebook post. \"This guy is not a conservative... I truly hate what our country has become... it is literally a cartel that wear[s] different badges while stealing the voice in a sea of treason,\" posted Oltmann. NPR's Miles Parks reported from Washington, D.C., and Colorado Public Radio's  Bente Birkeland  reported from  Colorado . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5570731","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-20:00","title":"Frankenstein is the monster (movie) Guillermo del Toro was born to bring to life","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Guillermo del Toro has released a new film adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein, embodying his signature style of portraying the Creature as emotionally intelligent, empathetic, and deeply human.

born to bring to life \n         By Glen Weldon \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Guillermo del Toro has made several monster movies of a particular bent — soulful, swoony, feverish films about grotesque-looking creatures who prove themselves more deeply human than the humans who reject them.  Hellboy  (2004) was a half-demon with a full heart. The Amphibian Man in  The Shape of Water   (2017)   was an emo f-boy with gill slits. Even the titular marionette in  Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio  ( 2022)   was such a mensch that he earned the right to trade in his knotty pine physiognomy for a flesh bag. Soulful, swoony, feverish, with a narrative that stacks the emotional deck in favor of the hideous outcast — I mean, that's pretty much the jacket copy you'd find on any volume of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel  Frankenstein , right? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Which is why this seems like the perfect match between story and muse; certainly  del Toro's been talking about  making his own version of the tale for decades, calling it his \"lifelong dream.\" That dream is now realized, and while the resulting film captures the tone and spirit of the original novel in all its breathless zeal and hie-me-to-yon-fainting-couch deliriousness, the many narrative tweaks del Toro has made — some of which work, some of which don't — ensure that you'd never mistake his  Frankenstein  for anyone else's. A monster matriculates It's light-years away, for example, from James Whale's iconic 1931 version, which surgically implanted Boris Karloff's lumbering, flat-topped, bolt-necked monster into the culture. Because while Whale was faithful to the bones (heh) of the novel, Karloff's Creature never grew, intellectually or aesthetically. Maybe Whale was worried doing so would rob the monster of its primal power to clomp its way into his audience's nightmares. The book's Creature, on the other hand, puts itself through a kind of hilarious autodidactical speed run, devouring  Plutarch's Lives  and  The Sorrows of Young Werther  and, famously,  Paradise Lost . Which is why you get the following disconnect: Book Creature: \"I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.\" Karloff's Creature: \"FIRE BAD.\" There's a lot more of book Creature in del Toro's  Frankenstein , which is good, because his monster inhabits the (literally, in this case) sculpted frame and brooding gaze of Jacob Elordi. For roughly half of his time onscreen, Elordi's more or less in \"FIRE BAD\" mode, stumbling around in yellowish strips of cloth that, intentionally or not (but let's face it, probably intentionally) evoke the gold lamé speedo sported by his  Rocky Horror Picture Show  analog. But before long the Creature installs that all-important upgrade: He secretly observes the daily life of a loving family, befriends their kindly blind patriarch (David Bradley) and avails himself of their reading matter. Elordi makes his Creature 2.0 just as compelling as the launch version; now outfitted with the full complement of human-emotion DLC (rage, yes — but also gratitude, empathy, sorrow and regret), he sets out to confront Victor (Oscar Isaac), his preening, arrogant brat of a creator. This is all straight from Shelley's novel, of course — it's just inflected by del Toro's maximalist, heart-affixed-firmly-to-the-sleeve sensibility, which extends to absolutely everything onscreen. The production design goes gratifyingly hard, featuring drawing rooms so huge their walls vanish into shadow, landscapes so vast they swallow the characters — and the buildings they occupy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Victor's lonely tower — the site of the Creature's birth — is a gargoyle-festooned ruin atop a cliff so open to the elements that its rooms and staircases are piled with leaves and other bits of decaying organic matter. Its tiled floors feature yawning pits like frozen whirlpools, foreboding but strangely beautiful. Spare parts But del Toro's spin on the material goes beyond its look and feel – he's made several changes to the story that leave you wondering what narrative work they are actually doing, besides adding needless complications to justify the film's two-and-half-hour running time. He devotes a lot of attention — far more than the book does — to the life of young Frankenstein (heh), played by Christian Convery. Charles Dance adds yet another \"stern father\" performance to an IMDB page teeming with them, as Victor's demanding dad, and their frosty, lightly sadistic relationship is clearly meant to foreshadow the one Victor will have with his Creature. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tim Burton's  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , and its mystifying determination to explain to us that Wonka only became the candymaker he did because his father was … a dentist. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The film also introduces Christoph Waltz as Harlander, a mysterious figure who acts as Victor's financial patron. The character ostensibly exists to contrast Victor's scientific zeal to the greedy drive of capitalism, but I can't shake the conviction that he could easily lift out of the film without leaving a hole. A subplot involving Mia Goth's Elizabeth represents another significant alteration that's puzzling at first — why make Elizabeth the fiancée of Victor's brother William (Felix Kammerer) instead of just making her Victor's fiancée, as she is in the book? The answer lies in the largest and most essential change that del Toro is making to the story here, which is to turn Victor into even  more  of a jerk — and, by extension, to cast the Creature as even more sympathetic. It's there in Isaac's bluff, snotty, snooty take on Victor, who's forever declaring his genius to anyone in earshot. It's there in his snarling disgust at Elordi's poor, chained up Creature. And it's there in Victor's not-remotely-sly attempts to seduce his own brother's fiancée. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Elizabeth, for her part, is totally on board with del Toro's efforts to get us on the Creature's side; Goth shows us a young woman smart and self-possessed enough to recognize that underneath all the sutures and skin grafts, it's still Jacob Freaking Elordi we're talking about, here, people. Del Toro doesn't stop there — he also elides book-Creature's most unsavory aspects and actions to highlight his version's wet-eyed soulfulness and further cement its status as a blameless thing grievously wronged by the world in general, and by Victor in particular. It's a marked adjustment from the novel, yes — but one that seems inevitable, given del Toro's body of work, and his resolute need to portray the outsider as hero. He's never been subtle about this, and he's not here either: At one point a character regards Victor. \" You  are the monster,\" they tell him. I cannot hope to convey, reader, just how wildly unnecessary that line is, given literally everything about the film we've been watching up to that point. It's del Toro gilding a lily that he's already spent more than two hours painstakingly crafting out of pure, 24-carat gold. And yet it works, for him, and for his movie. Del Toro couldn't possibly do anything less, and, given how perfectly suited he is to tell this story in this particular way, you wouldn't want him to.

investing in British soccer teams? \n         By Robbie Griffiths \n        \n           Updated Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 10:23 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Nestled on Britain's south coast in the county of Dorset, Bournemouth is a quintessential English seaside town, known for its sandy beach and fish and chips. At the start of October, Bournemouth men's soccer team hosted Fulham, London's oldest professional soccer team, for a tightly contested Premier League match. But although these two soccer teams might seem entirely English, they are both actually owned by Americans. And they are not alone: teams like Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United, who have fans around the world, also now all have American owners. In fact,  more than half  of the 92 teams in the top four leagues in England and Wales have some American ownership, while Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport,\" explains Jim Frevola, Bournemouth's president of business operations. Frevola moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the franchise for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola compares the prices of British soccer teams to franchises in sports like the NFL and NBA in America. \"Teams are going for six, eight billion … where you could buy teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity,\" Frevola said. \"And, it's the best league in the world of the best sport in the world.\" Since moving to Bournemouth, Frevola has been struck by the passion of English soccer fans. \"I never thought sports was different… until I came over here,\" Frevola said. \"It wasn't until two, three months of living here did I realize that this is their life … this is what people live and breathe for. That's special. That's unique.\" Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-tier team in Yorkshire, which he bought two years ago. \"I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming,\" Nagle joked. \"I purchased it outright in a really short period of time, sight unseen,\" he added. \"It wasn't until after the fact that I came to Huddersfield to see what it was like. And I was very, very happy.\" Nagle also owns a soccer team in California, Sacramento Republic. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. \"It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans, because their great, great, great-grandparents were watching the team play,\" Nagle says. \"Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not.\"  The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball star LeBron James in Liverpool. Similarly, actor Michael B. Jordan has a stake in Bournemouth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of the stars have made documentaries about their teams. First, Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds — who was born in Canada — and his fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney made the documentary  Welcome to Wrexham  about their journey buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham, which is now in its fourth season. This year, ex-NFL player Tom Brady joined them with his documentary  Built in Birmingham , about becoming co-owner of Birmingham City Football Club. TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer, particularly the  successful TV dramedy  Ted Lasso , about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. Starring Jason Sudeikis and Brett Goldstein, the show — which has won multiple Emmys — is set to release its fourth season next year. Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sport finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement in many of the franchises can be attention-grabbing, it usually takes the form of a minority stake. \"They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income particularly around commercial partnerships,\" Philippou said. She explained that while English football has seen investment from Russia and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made their teams more commercial, as well as boosting women's football teams at many British franchises. \"We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football within club level … part of [that] is American money because traditionally they've been more interested in women's football.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the U.S., British soccer has a growing audience, with as many as 40 million fans, with many watching on CBS, says Ben Wright, chief commercial officer for the English Football League — which covers both England and Wales. Wright said interest in soccer in America grew noticeably during the pandemic. \"It felt like … because people couldn't go out and about globally, they were watching a lot more,\" Wright said. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi, the Argentinian who many consider the greatest soccer player of all time, plays for the American Major League Soccer team Inter Miami. On top of that, next summer's World Cup is being held jointly by the USA, Canada and Mexico, which experts hope will only grow the sport. Some soccer fans back in Britain fear that American owners might want to make changes to their league, such as playing league games in the USA. But Bournemouth's business manager Jim Frevola says that although he is aiming to grow his team's fan base back in the USA, there are no plans for major overhauls. \"I think there's maybe a misconception that American ownership wants to institute [big changes],\" Frevola said. \"I've heard crazy things like all-star games. That's never going to happen.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a pub near Bournemouth's Vitality Stadium, most fans are in favor of their American owner Bill Foley. Supporter Ceri Morgan said that although the slightly increased ticket prices have been a drawback, the investment is clear to see. \"The stadium looks a lot smarter now and we're getting an increased capacity next season,\" he said. His fellow life-long fan Dom Webb agreed. \"It's been incredible. … We've got really solid foundations now, and it feels like the sky's the limit,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, LeBron James, Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds have all invested in British soccer teams. They're part of a trend. Half of English Football League teams are now partly or wholly owned by Americans. Imagine. NPR's Robbie Griffiths went out to a game to find out why. (SOUNDBITE OF OCEAN WHOOSHING) ROBBIE GRIFFITHS, BYLINE: Nestled on Britain's south coast in the county of Dorset, Bournemouth is a quintessential English seaside town known for its sandy beach and fish and chips. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL CHANT) GRIFFITHS: Tonight, Bournemouth men's soccer team, known as The Cherries, are hosting Fulham, London's oldest professional club, in a tightly contested Premier League match. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And your Cherries, AFC Bournemouth. GRIFFITHS: But there's a twist. Although these two soccer teams might seem as English as they come, they are both owned by Americans. And they are not alone. Teams like Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United, with fans around the world, all have American owners. JIM FREVOLA: It's a much more affordable option into a high level of major sport. GRIFFITHS: Jim Frevola is Bournemouth's president of business operations. He moved from America to Bournemouth three years ago to help run the club for billionaire owner Bill Foley. Frevola explains that it's more affordable for rich Americans to invest in smaller British soccer teams and work on growing them than to buy sports franchises back in the USA, comparing prices to the NFL and NBA. FREVOLA: Teams are going for $6 billion, $8 billion, where you could buy, you know, teams in the Premier League for a much more affordable opportunity. And it's the best league in the world of the best sports - the best sport in the world. GRIFFITHS: In fact, half of the 72 teams in the English Football League have some American ownership, and Americans are also investing in teams in Scotland and across Europe. There are so many U.S. owners of British soccer clubs that many of them are in a WhatsApp group where they compare notes. KEVIN NAGLE: Well, here's the thing. I guess instead of saying the British are coming, we say the Americans are coming. Right? GRIFFITHS: Health care and real estate investor Kevin Nagle is the owner of Huddersfield, a third-division team in Yorkshire. Nagel also owns a soccer team in Sacramento. But like Jim Frevola, he says there's something special about the richness of British soccer history. NAGLE: It's just amazing when we see a lot of our fans because their great, great, great grandparents, you know, were watching the team play. Do we love our soccer in the U.S.? Yes. But do we have the traditions in the U.K.? Absolutely not. GRIFFITHS: The involvement of several U.S. celebrities has brought extra attention to British soccer teams. Actor Will Ferrell has invested in Leeds, rapper Snoop Dogg in Swansea, and basketball player LeBron James in Liverpool. Some have even made TV shows about their teams. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"WELCOME TO WREXHAM\") RYAN REYNOLDS: (As self) To make a diamond, you have to have pressure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROB MCELHENNEY: (As self) What could possibly go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANNING TATUM: (As self) I'm very much into this. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) UNIDENTIFIED FANS: (Shouting) Yeah. REYNOLDS: (As himself) Football. MCELHENNEY: (As self) Football. GRIFFITHS: That's Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds and fellow actor and producer Rob McElhenney in their documentary about buying the Welsh franchise Wrexham. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TED LASSO\") JASON SUDEIKIS: (As Ted Lasso) And all you fellas need to do is believe it. UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) Ooh. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Coach, no. It's a sign. GRIFFITHS: TV fiction has also boosted American interest in British soccer. This is the hugely successful TV dramedy \"Ted Lasso,\" about an American college football coach who is hired to manage a London soccer team. But it's the real-world Americans - notably celebrities - who seem to be making the difference. CHRISTINA PHILIPPOU: They are able to effectively use their status to enhance the image of the club and help bring in more external income, particularly around commercial partnerships. GRIFFITHS: Christina Philippou, an associate professor in accounting and sports finance at the University of Portsmouth, said the celebrity involvement - usually a minority stake - helps with sponsorship. She explains that while English football has seen investment from Russians and the Gulf countries over the years, the new U.S. owners have made it more commercial, as well as making other changes. PHILIPPOU: We've seen a little bit more investment in women's football, as well, within club level. Part of it is American money because traditionally, they've been more interested in women's football as well. (CROSSTALK) GRIFFITHS: Back in a pub in Bournemouth, some soccer fans having a pint were worried that American investors would want to change their game somehow. But most, like life-long Bournemouth supporter Dom Webb, said they are happy. The U.S. owners have raised ticket prices, but are also upgrading the stadium and signing better players. DOM WEBB: It's been incredible. We've got really solid foundations now. And, like, it feels like the sky's the limit, really. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Semenyo. (CHEERING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: The Cherries are heading to second in the Premier League. GRIFFITHS: In the driving English rain, Bournemouth come from behind to beat Fulham 3-1, and the crowd goes wild. Bournemouth supporters say as long as their team keeps winning, they will keep backing their American owners.

      Trump administration says most federal layoffs aren't blocked by court order \n         By Andrea Hsu, Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Updated Friday, October 17, 2025 • 7:54 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order. That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday. Friday's court filing came  amid a legal fight  between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call \"politically driven RIFs,\" or reductions in force. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause. As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with \"an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.  At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs   have members or bargaining units. In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to \"err on the side of caution.\" She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding \"We ought not make it worse.\" The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order. The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.  In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions. Earlier this year, President Trump issued  an executive order  ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his  declaration to the court  about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown. \"HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,\" he wrote. \"Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.\" During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.  The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.  Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing. At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as \"ready, fire, aim\" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding \"to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston \"another far left, partisan judge.\" Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs \"an unfortunate consequence\" of the government shutdown. OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect. While the White House promised \"substantial\" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January. Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary. That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates. Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577136","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-20:00","title":"With some shutdown pain points delayed for now, talks in Congress are 'nowhere'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is in a fourth week of a partial shutdown, with no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on a funding resolution.

In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to  a stopgap bill  passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21. After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were \"nowhere.\" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week. One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget  said  in a post on social media that it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\" The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover  the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers . The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security — including at TSA and ICE —  would be paid  \"for all hours worked during the shutdown period.\" OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said \"Democrat programs\" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet. Predicting tough days ahead  Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children. And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past. The approach \"may or may not take some pressure off,\" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable. Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts \"are just getting started,\" he warned. \"Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,\" Emmer said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority — denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House — as a way to force a debate about  expiring health care subsidies . They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table. Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers. He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies. \"Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.\" November 1 could be a key date  November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?\" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.  \"This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,\" according to Welch.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal \"happens after they open up the government.\" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome. Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, \"these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,\" he told reporters, referring to a \"No Kings\" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies. Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a \"deal\" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him  rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states . \"As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577129","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-20:00","title":"Trump ties crime with immigration, blurring the lines with Guard deployment","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how President Donald Trump has escalated immigration enforcement through the deployment of the National Guard in multiple U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, D.C., and Memphis, often under the pretext of fighting crime.

   \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         CHICAGO — It's a sunny October morning, and Yackson is waiting for a bus that will take him to meet his immigration attorney. The Venezuelan, who NPR is identifying by his first name because of his immigration status, looks at a big, run-down apartment building in front of him. Earlier this month, it was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who landed a helicopter on the roof, and arrested more than 30 people. Yackson, 39, says he's terrified. Besides this raid, he's also heard about the possibility of National Guard troops deploying here, something a federal court has put on hold for now. The father of three lives in this neighborhood and he's been scared to leave his house. \"We already don't know who is grabbing us, whether it's ICE or whether it's people who disguise themselves as ICE,\" Yackson says in Spanish. \"With the National Guard, it's going to be even harder, scarier.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In several cities across the country facing National Guard deployments, NPR has heard similar sentiment. \"The government isn't exactly doing a great job of proactively delineating this person is National Guard who isn't allowed to arrest immigrants, and this person is an ICE agent or an FBI agent who is,\" says Dara Lind a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noting that many times federal agents are in military-style gear, or masked, or not clearly marked. She says this makes it hard to look at patrols on the street and figure out who is legally authorized to engage in law enforcement activities or not. Under U.S. law, the National Guard and other military personnel can't make arrests. But experts worry that the pattern of their deployments, alongside increased federal immigration raids and operations, has allowed for violent crime and illegal immigration to be conflated into a single crisis. The Guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. In September, the Trump administration announced a widespread ICE operation in Illinois called Operation Midway Blitz, saying it was needed to fight crime by undocumented immigrants. It came after Trump had been pressuring Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to deploy the state National Guard for the same reason, but Pritzker refused. After weeks of fighting between the two, Trump federalized the Illinois National Guard – a highly unusual move — and worked with Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott to send hundreds of his state's Guard to Illinois. Part of Trump's continued rhetoric Trump has been  conflating crime and illegal immigration  since he first emerged on the political scene. It's something that has proved popular with his base — and helped garner support for his  unprecedented crackdown on immigrants . The net has swept up people living in the country illegally along with U.S. residents, people with visas, or those granted humanitarian parole. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The White House regularly characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness,  even though the data show that is not true . Officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House constantly refer to ICE actions as only targeting \" the worst of the worst ,\" a talking point that isn't  supported by the arrest data . \"This is really, really core to the administration's immigration policy. They toggle between 'we're only going after these really, really bad criminals,' and 'we're deporting everybody who's in the country without authorization,'\" says Lind. \"They get to play that two-step because there's this bigger body of fears that they're playing into about urban areas as unsafe, as unruly, about there being some kind of unrest, and about protests being always akin to riots.\" Trump has deployed  the National Guard in five Democratic-led cities  so far — often over the objections of state and local leaders — claiming troops are needed to control crime and lawlessness, although data show that violent crime in many of those places has decreased in recent years. Some of those deployments — like in  Chicago  and  Portland, Ore.  — have been blocked by the courts and are making their way through a federal appeals process. But others are ongoing, like in Washington, D.C., and Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       These deployments have coincided with increased immigration raids which have, in effect, blurred the lines between traditional law enforcement, immigration enforcement and the role of the National Guard. In June,  Trump federalized California's National Guard  — against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes – and sent in members of the U.S. Marine Corps to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to increased immigration and deportation raids in the city. There, protesters confined to an area of downtown Los Angeles clashed with federal agents. And ICE  often launched raids  at Home Depot stores and other locations across the city. A federal judge in California  later ruled  that the National Guard troops were being used illegally there, violating the  Posse Comitatus Act , a 19th-century law that bars the use of federal troops for domestic policing, except when \"expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\" Trump appealed that ruling, and a hearing is expected later this month. Trump has also deployed troops to guard federal agents who are carrying out immigration enforcement operations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In August, Trump sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., a unique place where Trump has the legal authority to do so, along with a flood of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE, which has carried out a  sizable chunk of the arrests . The next month,  Trump announced a similar operation in Memphis  — with the support of Republican Governor Bill Lee, who approved the use of Tennessee National Guard troops. The deployment started at the end of September and is ongoing. The operation also includes officials from more than a dozen federal agencies, including ICE, and has led to more than 800 arrests, according to the Department of Justice. While the DOJ has not released a breakdown of that data, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who has been critical of the federal intervention,  noted at a press conference this week  that immigration offenses made up a significant portion of the arrests. Immigration and National Guard deployments are \"deeply intertwined\" In Illinois, Texas National Guard troops were briefly stationed at an ICE facility outside of Chicago, before their deployment was temporarily blocked. In D.C., troops have mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. In Memphis, they've been seen accompanying local law enforcement. But legal experts say there's a clear connection developing between Trump's use of the troops and his immigration enforcement tactics. \"We see these as deeply intertwined,\" says Benjamin Farley, special counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. \"The Trump administration is using an increasingly aggressive, increasingly brutal approach to immigration enforcement, which, unsurprisingly, inspires protests. And then the protests themselves serve as a pretext or an excuse for the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard and the Armed Forces of the United States,\" he says. The Texas National Guard — which has been federalized and deployed to Illinois, even as the deployment is challenged in court — has been involved in immigration-related operations in the past. In 2021, Gov. Abbott sent hundreds of troops to the Texas-Mexico border to assist in his multibillion dollar initiative called  Operation Lone Star . Among the tasks for the troops were repelling migrants and, at least in one instance, troops used tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border. That operation is still ongoing. Scott R. Anderson, a fellow specializing in national security law at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, notes that the way Trump seems to be using the National Guard now — largely guarding federal property — is not as dramatic as a lot of the rhetoric surrounding the deployments. Still, he says that it is pushing the envelope of the law, and could gradually change with further deployments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think precisely because it's unprecedented and because it's on uncertain legal territory, the administration is actually doing it kind of incrementally, they're not immediately jumping to the most severe thing they could be doing. And that makes just a more complicated picture, and it also complicates how you respond to it in a lot of ways,\" he says. But the legal grounds for the deployments aren't something many people caught up in them have the luxury of thinking about, says Lind of the American Immigration Council. For communities who are targeted and already frightened, taking the time to differentiate between the National Guard and a federal law enforcement agency is secondary to staying safe. \"I don't think a whole lot of people are particularly interested in parsing the relationship between the National Guard and federal law enforcement,\" she says.  NPR's Marisa Peñaloza contributed to this report from Chicago.  \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   President Trump's National Guard deployments have been blurring the lines between crime patrols and illegal immigration enforcement. Guard troops have been sent to help with immigration enforcement, including securing federal ICE facilities and in some cases protecting ICE agents during raids. The White House frequently characterizes undocumented immigrants as drivers of urban lawlessness, even though the data shows that is not true. Here to talk about all of this is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and NPR's Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Hey to both of you. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Hey there. SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: Sergio, let's start with you. Just catch us up on what's been happening on the ground in Chicago the last few days. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, Ailsa, the National Guard is in Illinois. More specifically, the Texas National Guard is in Illinois, along with some federalized Illinois guard. But you won't see them out in the streets of Chicago, though. That's because a federal court temporarily blocked its deployment yesterday. Now, the only place that troops were sent in Illinois so far is an ICE processing facility outside of Chicago. I went there and not much was happening. CHANG: OK. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Now, last month, ICE launched a new operation here in Chicago, claiming it was needed to fight off crime - something state and local leaders strongly refute. Chicago has its ongoing challenges with crime - right? - but the city's homicide rate this summer was the lowest since 1965. But this is what Trump has been doing since he first emerged on the political scene - deliberately conflating these ideas of crime and illegal immigration, which has proved popular with his base and helped to garner support for his unprecedented crackdown on immigrants - those in the country illegally and, in some cases, people who are U.S. residents or have visas. CHANG: OK. Well, Kat, you've been following these various National Guard deployments or threats of deployments the past few weeks. LONSDORF: Yeah. CHANG: Can you just talk about the larger pattern you're seeing here? LONSDORF: Yeah. I mean, Trump's conflation of crime and illegal immigration has been at the center of many of these deployments. We first saw it back in June, when Trump federalized California's National Guard against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes. Trump did that to quell protests in Los Angeles in response to immigration and deportation raids in the city. The Guard was sent in to protect federal ICE facilities and personnel in that case too. And that's the same reasoning Trump has given for federalizing the Guard in Oregon as well, even though that is currently halted by the federal courts, too. Experts we've talked to say these National Guard deployments and the administration's immigration tactics are pretty intertwined right now. Here's Benjamin Farley with the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. BENJAMIN FARLEY: Using the aggressive and sort of brutal approach to immigration enforcement, generating a very expected reaction and then letting that reaction serve as a pretext for the deployment of armed forces. LONSDORF: And, you know, legally speaking, when the National Guard is federalized, which is the case in all these Democratic states where the governors have pushed back, they can't enforce state laws unless the governors say they can. CHANG: That's right. And let's be very clear here. Even if the president says that these troops are going to help fight crime in these various places, let's remember that the National Guard cannot make arrests. They cannot, like, join up with local law enforcement officers to fight crime, right? LONSDORF: Right. But they can help immigration enforcement even if they still can't make arrests because that's federal. Here's how Scott R. Anderson at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution explained it. SCOTT R ANDERSON: He's trying to get them to consent to doing a broader mission set. But until they do, he's doing this narrow one to focus on immigration law 'cause that's what he has the legal authority to do. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: And Ailsa, there's something else that's significant here. It was Texas Governor Greg Abbott who sent his National Guard troops to Illinois at Trump's request. And the Texas guard, contrary to other state guards, has been involved in immigration operations. Abbott sent troops to the Texas-Mexico border to repel migrants as part of a multibillion-dollar effort called Operation Lone Star. I mean, there's footage of troops using tear gas on a group of Venezuelan migrants at the border in 2024. So the Texas guard has done immigration-related work before, and that could impact how they'd operate if allowed to patrol on the streets here in Illinois. CHANG: But what about in places like Memphis, where the governor has approved the use of the National Guard, or in the case of D.C., where the guard is technically under the president's control? Like, how does all of that fit here? LONSDORF: Yeah, in both D.C. and Memphis, Trump has sent in various federal agencies and National Guard troops to fight crime. And federal law enforcement officials have made a lot of arrests in both those places, but a significant portion of them have been immigration-related. I talked with Maria Oceja. She's in Memphis. She's a community organizer and immigration advocate there. She says while other people in the city might have focused on Trump's message about fighting crime, immigrant communities were skeptical. MARIA OCEJA: We have been tracking the messaging that has been coming out of the White House, and so we are not fooled by this language of, oh, we're only going to Memphis to fight crime. LONSDORF: She says there's been a lot of confusion and fear in the community there. The guard's actual role in immigration enforcement in these deployments remains unclear. Again, they cannot legally make arrests. In D.C., they've mainly been cleaning up streets and guarding federal buildings. CHANG: OK. Well, Sergio, I know that you've been talking to people in Chicago all week. What have you been hearing from them? MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah. I mean, a lot of U.S.-born residents tell us that they are angry. They don't want the National Guard or federal immigration agents in their communities, especially because their tactics have become more aggressive, leading to the arrest of some U.S. citizens. And for undocumented immigrants, the terror is real. I talked to Jackson (ph), a Venezuelan immigrant who did not want us to use his last name because of his legal status. JACKSON: (Speaking Spanish). MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says that it's already been scary and challenging to live in the city where you don't know if the masked person arresting you is ICE or someone pretending to be. And with the National Guard in town, Jackson says it will be even worse. CHANG: That is NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Chicago and Kat Lonsdorf in D.C. Thank you to both of you. LONSDORF: Thanks, Ailsa. MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live performances from various artists on NPR's Tiny Desk series.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Live Music","Featured Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5578866","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"03:30:00-04:00","title":"Shohei Ohtani hits 3 homers and strikes out 10 in Dodgers' clinching 5-1 NLCS win over Brewers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shohei Ohtani delivered a legendary two-way performance in Game 4 of the 2025 National League Championship Series, hitting three home runs and striking out 10 batters while pitching a shutout into the seventh inning.

\n\n         LOS ANGELES — Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers back to the World Series with a two-way performance for the ages. Ohtani hit three mammoth homers and struck out 10 while pitching shutout ball into the seventh inning, and the Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers out of the National League Championship Series with a 5-1 victory in Game 4 on Friday night. \"That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"There's been a lot of postseason games. And there's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Dodgers will have a chance to become baseball's first repeat World Series champions in a quarter-century after this mind-blowing night for the three-time MVP, who emphatically ended a quiet postseason by his lofty standards. Ohtani was selected the NLCS MVP essentially on the strength of this one unforgettable game. \"This time around it was my turn to be able to perform,\" he said through his interpreter. After striking out three in the top of the first inning, Ohtani hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history off Brewers starter Jose Quintana. Ohtani followed with a 469-foot drive in the fourth, clearing a pavilion roof in right-center. He added a third solo shot in the seventh, becoming the 12th big league player to hit three homers in a postseason game. His three homers traveled a combined 1,342 feet. Ohtani also thoroughly dominated the Brewers in his second career postseason start on the mound, allowing two hits in his first double-digit strikeout game in a Dodgers uniform. He didn't allow a hit until the fourth, and he fanned two Brewers in the fourth, fifth and sixth. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,\" said teammate Freddie Freeman, last season's World Series MVP. \"Absolutely incredible. Biggest stage, and he goes out and does something like that. It'll probably be remembered as the Shohei Ohtani game.\" After the Brewers' first two batters reached in the seventh, Ohtani left the mound to a stadium-shaking ovation — and after Alex Vesia escaped the jam, Ohtani celebrated by hitting his third homer in the bottom half. The powerhouse Dodgers are the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. Los Angeles is back in the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, and it will attempt to become baseball's first repeat champs since the New York Yankees won three straight World Series from 1998 to 2000. \"That was special,\" Freeman said. \"We've just been playing really good baseball for a while now, and the inevitable kind of happened today — Shohei. Oh my God. I'm still speechless.\" Following a 9-1 rampage through the NL playoffs, the Dodgers are headed to the World Series for the 23rd time in franchise history, including 14 pennants since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Only the Yankees, last year's opponent, have made more appearances in the Fall Classic (41). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Los Angeles will have a week off before the World Series begins next Friday, either in Toronto or at Dodger Stadium against Seattle. The Mariners beat the Blue Jays 6-2 earlier Friday to take a 3-2 lead in the ALCS, which continues Sunday at Rogers Centre. The Dodgers had never swept an NLCS in 16 previous appearances, but they became only the fifth team to sweep this series while thoroughly dominating a Milwaukee club that led the major leagues with 97 wins during the season. Los Angeles is the first team to sweep a best-of-seven postseason series since 2022, and the first to sweep an NLCS since Washington in 2019. \"Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,\" Roberts shouted to the crowd during the on-field celebration. \"Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!\" The NL Central champion Brewers were eliminated by the Dodgers for the third time during their current stretch of seven playoff appearances in eight years. Even after setting a franchise record for wins this season, Milwaukee is still waiting for its first World Series appearance since 1982. \"We were part of tonight an iconic, maybe the best individual performance ever in a postseason game,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \"I don't think anybody can argue with that. A guy punches out 10 and hits three homers.\" The Brewers had never been swept in a playoff series longer than a best-of-three, but their bats fell silent in the NLCS against the Dodgers' brilliant starting rotation. Los Angeles' four starters combined to pitch 28 2/3 innings with two earned runs allowed and 35 strikeouts. \"I really think that to beat us four games in a row, you've got to do a lot of things right,\" outfielder Blake Perkins said. \"Some things had to go their way that didn't go our way. We hit a lot of balls at people. But either way, Ohtani did great today. Is he the greatest player ever? I don't know. But he sure seemed like it tonight.\" The Dodgers added two more runs in the first after Ohtani's tone-setting homer, with Mookie Betts and Will Smith both singling and scoring. Jackson Chourio doubled leading off the fourth for Milwaukee's first hit, but Ohtani stranded him. Struggling Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen allowed two more baserunners in the eighth, and Caleb Durbin scored when Brice Turang beat out his potential double-play grounder before Anthony Banda ended the inning. Roki Sasaki pitched the ninth in the latest successful relief outing for the Dodgers' unlikely rookie closer. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5566732","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"15:52:00-04:00","title":"The test for U.S. citizenship is about to get harder","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the U.S. naturalization process, making the civics oral exam more difficult and longer.

administration is making it harder to pass the oral exam required for immigrants seeking naturalization as U.S. citizens.   The new test is also longer. Green card holders who file for citizenship after Oct. 20 will have to answer twice as many questions correctly during the civics interview that tests their knowledge of U.S. history, politics and government and that is one of the final steps in the naturalization process. The list of possible questions will also get longer and include more difficult questions. A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Matthew Tragesser, said in  a statement  when the changes were announced recently that the new test will ensure \"that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" It's just one of several changes the Trump administration has instituted to make citizenship harder to earn as it seeks more broadly to limit the ability of immigrants and visa holders to enter, remain or settle in the U.S. The citizenship test that USCIS has used  since 2008  requires applicants to answer six questions correctly out of 10. The  new test  will require 12 correct answers out of 20. The list of possible questions the agent chooses from will grow from 100 to 128, and many will be more difficult. Questions about U.S. holidays and geography and others with short answers – \"What ocean is on the West Coast of the United States?\" – are being reduced or eliminated, and replaced with tougher ones: \"Why did the United States enter the Persian Gulf War?\" (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To force the Iraqi military from Kuwait.\") Another new question: Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War? (Answer, according to the study guide: \"To stop the spread of communism.\") Aside from the tougher civics test, applicants for citizenship will also have to convince an immigration officer that they have \"good moral character.\" Until now, the absence of bad behavior or criminal conduct on an applicant's record has been enough. Now, they'll need to submit evidence of their \"positive contributions to American society.\" Immigration officers will also more rigorously check applicants' backgrounds, possibly interviewing co-workers, family members or neighbors. Advocates who help people prepare for the citizenship test say the changes present more obstacles in an already challenging and cumbersome process. \"It's hard to imagine that these changes don't have a negative impact on the number of people who are able to continue the naturalization process,\" said Julie Mitchell, legal director of the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles, which offers citizenship courses. \"Particularly considering that these changes will impact individuals with low literacy levels and those who don't have access to classes and preparation materials.\" She said the naturalization process could also become more uncertain, because it's unclear what standards immigration officers will use to assess \"good moral character.\" Speaking in Washington  last month , USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said that the current test is \"just too easy\" because some questions require simple answers, like naming the governor of an applicant's home state, or two federal holidays. \"We need to know more,\" Edlow said. \"Especially if we're going to really understand whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution as required by the statute.\" But Amanda Frost, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and the author of  You Are Not American , a book about the history of citizenship stripping, said that while requiring applicants for citizenship to jump over hurdles is appropriate, there's no proof that the existing naturalization process is falling short. \"Has there been any evidence that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share our values, and don't make for good participants in our democracy?\" Frost asked. \"I don't see any evidence of that.\" She notes that nearly  half of all Fortune 500  companies were founded by immigrants or their children. \"Those who naturalize, and their children, thrive in the United States, and have benefited this country,\" Frost said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The Trump administration is making it harder for immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens. Starting next week, it is rolling out changes to the civics test that candidates for citizenship are required to pass. This is one of several changes the administration says are aimed at making sure new U.S. citizens are - in its words - fully assimilated. We're joined now by NPR's Adrian Florido. And Adrian, just explain the process here. The civics test is the last - one of the last steps in the naturalization process. Applicants go into an immigration office. They get asked a bunch of questions by the agent. If they pass, they usually earn their citizenship. And that process is not changing, right? ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: That's right, Mary Louise. That process is staying the same. What is changing is that applicants will now have to answer more questions correctly to pass that test. So with the current test, they have to get right 6 out of 10 questions that the agent asks them. They'll now have to get twice as many right - 12 out of up to 20 possible questions. And the list of possible questions that they will have to study from is also going to get quite a lot longer, so there'll be a lot more answers to memorize before you go in for the test. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, is also eliminating what are seen as easier questions on this test - so those about geography. For example, what ocean is on the West Coast of the U.S.? That question is out, and it's being replaced with questions like, why did the U.S. enter the Persian Gulf War? The right answer, according to the government, is - was to force the Iraqi military from Kuwait. The idea, Mary Louise, is to make this test harder to pass. KELLY: And why do this? Why does the Trump administration say these changes are needed? FLORIDO: Well, USCIS has said that they're about restoring, quote, \"integrity\" to the naturalization process. They're saying that the test is too easy. But these changes also reflect broader principles that President Trump has embraced about, you know, what it means to be a good American. A USCIS spokesman said in a statement that U.S. citizenship should only be for people who, quote, \"fully embrace our values and principles as a nation.\" And he said that this new test will ensure that new citizens are, quote, \"fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness.\" The naturalization process is also changing in other ways, Mary Louise. USCIS is requiring applicants to prove that they are of, quote, \"good moral character\" by providing evidence of positive contributions that they've made to the U.S. And immigration officers are also going to do more rigorous background checks on applicants, including possibly interviewing their coworkers, neighbors or family members. KELLY: So go back to something we just heard in that statement from the immigration official - the term fully assimilated. What does that mean? FLORIDO: You know, it's not new that the naturalization process requires a certain amount of integration, or you might say assimilation, into U.S. society. Most applicants have to speak English well enough to answer questions about U.S. history and government, for example. But the government is now saying that the bar is too low. I asked University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, who wrote a book about citizenship called \"You Are Not American\" - I asked her for her take on that claim. AMANDA FROST: Has there been any evidence that we have held that standard too low - that we're allowing people to naturalize who don't share values, don't make for good participants in our democracy and our society? And I would say I don't see any evidence of that. Those that naturalize and their children thrive in the United States and have benefited this country. KELLY: Well, so Adrian, what are the possible consequences of these changes? FLORIDO: Well, it's becoming harder to earn U.S. citizenship. And one big question about these questions, Mary Louise, is whether they'll drive down naturalization rates. And it's going to take some time to answer that question, but it's something that folks who help people through the citizenship process worry could happen. KELLY: That's NPR's Adrian Florido. Thank you, Adrian. FLORIDO: Thank you, Mary Louise. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5571014","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"08:19:00-04:00","title":"As hundreds of millions of birds head south, the invisible danger is glass","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Every year, an estimated billion birds in the United States die from collisions with glass during migration season, a problem that has received growing attention due to high-profile incidents such as the 2023 event at Chicago’s McCormick Place Convention Center where over a thousand birds died in a single night.

AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Just after dawn in Washington, D.C., Stephanie Haley is walking a familiar downtown route, scanning the sidewalk next to office buildings. There, huddled on the ground, is a motionless olive-green songbird. It's an Acadian flycatcher, no doubt on its way to Central or South America before it slammed into a window. Haley quietly sidles up to it, gently placing a net over the bird. Then she picks the bird up, using a gloved hand. It begins peeping in dismay. \"This is a good sign, the fluttering, which means that hopefully he's just stunned,\" says Haley, who volunteers with a local group called  Lights Out DC , which urges people to turn off artificial lights during migration season, because these lights can attract birds and lead to deadly collisions. \"I'll take him to City Wildlife and the doctors will check him out,\" she says, referring to the local wildlife rescue nonprofit which organizes and runs Lights Out DC. But even though the vets put this bird in an oxygen chamber, it eventually succumbs to its injuries. Most collision victims do, even if they initially fly away. They can have concussions, and broken bones. \"They can be flying up to 30 miles per hour when they hit the glass, so it's a very loud thunk,\" says Lisbeth Fuisz, another volunteer. The latest estimates suggest that, every year in the United States, collisions with windows kill a billion birds. Other than cats and habitat loss, glass is the biggest danger birds face. But research and testing has shown what kinds of glass and window treatments really work to prevent collisions, says  Bryan Lenz , with the American Bird Conservancy. The trouble is, the advocates for the birds, like the birds themselves, are having to grapple with a landscape that is just covered with ubiquitous glass. \"It is becoming now a question of, how do we do it at a scale big enough,\" says Lenz, \"to save a billion birds.\" Transparent or reflective  Each night during migration season, hundreds of millions of birds take to the skies, flying through the night to take advantage of the evening's cool, stable air. They navigate with the help of the moon and the stars, and come down in the morning to rest. That's when they can encounter glass. Evolution hasn't prepared birds to deal with glass. If it's transparent, they think they can fly through it. If it's reflective, they can mistake the reflections for real trees and sky. Most collisions don't happen way up high. Instead, they typically occur close to the ground, below the treeline. So window collisions aren't just confined to cities. But cities tend to be where people go out looking for birds, trying to find them before the rats get them, or before custodians sweep them away. In DC, the data collected over the years by volunteers makes it clear that about a half-dozen buildings account for a large share of the deaths. Clearly, their architectural features confound the birds, turning the buildings into death traps where volunteers find corpses again and again. \"This is a problematic building,\" says Fuisz, walking up to one office complex on North Capitol street. It wraps around a plaza with trees, and has two sections that converge on a glass atrium, effectively funneling birds towards a multi-story wall of glass. \"Do you see how the reflection works?\" says Fuisz. \"It looks like you could keep going.\" On top of the building's entrance, a revolving door, she spots a small dead bird. It's a female yellowthroat that fell there after hitting the glass wall. \"That's a pretty common window collision victim,\" she says, carefully recording the death. Similar data collection efforts have been going on across the country, in places like Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Diego. The goal is to reveal the scale of a problem that's mostly invisible — unless something dramatic happens. A thousand birds On the night of October 4, 2023, hundreds of migrating birds slammed into McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago, a large building in one of the major migratory fly-ways that's floor-to-ceiling glass, right on the edge of Lake Michigan. This made headlines nationwide. \"People who never even thought about birds were suddenly like, 'Wait a minute, a thousand birds died in one night crashing into one building?'\" says  Tina Phillips , with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology This incident became something of a watershed. It inspired the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to convene a summit. Attendees included people from birding groups, government agencies, architecture firms, research universities, and dark sky groups that want to minimize artificial light. Phillips says they'd all been trying to prevent birds from hitting buildings, but separately. \"And so coming out of that meeting,\" she says, \"we knew we had to keep working together to really try to make this impact meaningful.\" They formed the  Bird Collision Prevention Alliance , and more than a hundred organizations have now joined, including federal agencies. They're sharing resources and ideas, and have working groups that meet frequently. This comes as the Trump administration has weakened federal protections for migratory birds, exempting companies from being responsible for birds killed accidentally. But members of the new alliance say their group isn't about pushing policy at the national level. \"We're just focusing on the science and we're focusing on the best way to save birds at scale,\" says Lenz, \"without getting bogged down in political conversations.\" He says in the past, people didn't know how to keep birds away from glass: \"People used to say, 'Put a hawk decal on your window and that's good because the birds will be scared of that.' The only thing that does is keep the bird from hitting the hawk decal.\" To understand how well modern solutions can work, consider the Chicago convention center where so many birds died in 2023. Staffers and researchers had been monitoring bird deaths there for some time, says chief operating officer and interim general manager  Patrick Allen . \"We were a big piece of glass sitting right out on the lake,\" he says. \"There's no doubt the reflections would attract the birds.\" After the high-profile mass collision, he says they decided to put an easy-to-install product on all of the windows. \"It's just nothing but a film with dots in a particular pattern,\" he says. \"You put it on the window, and you pull it off and the dots stay on.\" Data collected before and after this treatment showed that it reduced bird collisions by 95 percent. \"The numbers are awesome. We're very proud of it,\" says Allen, describing it as a \"win-win\" for both the convention center management and the birds. The fix cost over a million dollars, but Allen says that's only because they had a huge expanse of glass — enough to cover two football fields. And costs can come down if a building or major renovations are planned to be bird-friendly from the start. That's the case that wildlife advocates in Dallas are currently making, as that city is planning to substantially upgrade its Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. The convention center has been the top killer of birds in downtown Dallas among the 129 buildings that volunteers have monitored in the last few years, says Mei Ling Liu, community conservation director with the Texas Conservation Alliance. She says the center has accounted for 31% of the bird deaths they've logged. Her group is trying to get support for the new renovations to be done in a bird-friendly way. What's more,\"we're hoping to really use the case of the convention center to start having the conversations with other building managers,\" she says, saying that Dallas remains very bright at night during the migration season. Fixing it at home Only a few major cities in the U.S. have buildings requiring new construction or significant renovations to be done with bird-friendly materials — DC is one of them. And the data collected by volunteers in DC has convinced some building managers to make changes, like turning off lights and putting treatments on some windows. \"You would think that most buildings would care and want to fix the problem,\" says Stephanie Dalke, another volunteer with Lights Out DC. \"It turns out, it can be complicated and expensive to treat a commercial building.\" That's why she thinks it's important for homeowners to know what they can do. The cumulative effect of houses is large, because there's so many, but the amount of glass that needs to be treated at each one is small. The Bird Collision Prevention Alliance, for example, says a  start  could be treating home windows that have been known to have had a bird collision in the past, or windows that are near attractive features like birdfeeders or fruit trees. Dalke's monitoring path through DC takes her under a skyway that connects two buildings downtown. It's made of mirrored glass. \"We call this the walkway of death,\" she says. \"This is a very deadly spot.\" There on the ground is a dead ruby-throated hummingbird. It's tiny, the size of her thumb, with iridescent green feathers. It was on its way to Central America. \"It boggles the mind that these guys can fly over the Gulf of Mexico,\" she says. \"I mean, how can they do that? It's just amazing. But then we take them out, with some glass.\" She carefully notes the location and date, so this bird can go into the volunteer group's database. She takes a photo. Her cell phone is filled with hundreds of pictures of window collision victims. And then she keeps walking, looking for more — and hoping not to find them. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/no-kings-rallies-demonstrations-trump-4baa5de2fab057a0e6ab726f5d7747fd","dateOfPublication":"2023-05-27","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Escalation of Military Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine in May 2023","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the escalation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with Russia launching a significant military operation in Ukraine on May 20, 2023.

People carrying signs with slogans such as “Nothing is more patriotic than protesting” or “Resist Fascism” packed into New York City’s Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.  Trump’s Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as  “Hate America” rallies , but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution’s “We The People” preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ?

Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a “dictator.” “I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland — Portland bothered me the most, because I’m from Portland, and I don’t want the military in my cities. That’s scary,” Wingard said.  Tens of thousands of people gathered in Portland for a peaceful demonstration downtown. Later in the day, tensions grew as a few hundred protesters and counterprotesters showed up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement building, with federal agents at times firing tear gas to disperse the crowd and city police threatening to make arrests if demonstrators blocked streets. The building has been the site of mostly  small nightly protests  since June — the reason the Trump administration has cited for trying to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, which a federal judge has at least  temporarily blocked. About 3,500 people gathered in Salt Lake City outside the Utah State Capitol to share messages of  hope and healing  after a  protester was fatally shot  during the city’s first “No Kings” march in June.  And more than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and the city’s history of protests and the critical role it played in the Civil Rights Movement two generations ago.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It just feels like we’re living in an America that I don’t recognize,” said Jessica Yother, a mother of four. She and other protesters said they felt camaraderie by gathering in a state where Trump won nearly 65% of the vote last November. “It was so encouraging,” Yother said. “I walked in and thought, ‘Here are my people.’” Organizers hope to build opposition movement “Big rallies like this give confidence to people who have been sitting on the sidelines but are ready to speak up,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview with The Associated Press. While protests earlier this year —  against Elon Musk’s cuts  and Trump’s  military parade  — drew crowds, organizers say this one is uniting the opposition. Top Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer  and Independent Sen.  Bernie Sanders  are joining what organizers view as an antidote to Trump’s actions, from the administration’s clampdown on free speech to its military-style immigration raids. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n More than 2,600 rallies were planned Saturday, organizers said.

He said the American experiment is “in danger” under Trump but insisted, “We the people will rule.”  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Pulling a giant inflatable Donald Trump protesters march in the streets during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, in Los Angeles.

From the White House to Capitol Hill,  GOP leaders  called them “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders including Schumer are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut to appease those liberal forces. “I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said  House Speaker Mike Johnson  of Louisiana. “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism” and “Marxists in full display.”  Many demonstrators, in response, said they were meeting such hyperbole with humor, noting that Trump often leans heavily on theatrics such as claiming that cities he sends troops to are war zones. “So much of what we’ve seen from this administration has been so unserious and silly that we have to respond with the same energy,” said Glen Kalbaugh, a Washington protester who wore a wizard hat and held a sign with a frog on it. New York police reported no arrests during the protests. \n          \n             \n                \n                \n \n     \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Demonstrators wearing inflatable bald eagle costumes gather in Kiener Plaza during the \"No Kings\" protest in St. Louis, with the Gateway Arch in the background, on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

Republicans say they are willing to discuss the issue later, only after the government reopens. The situation is a potential turnaround from just six months ago, when Democrats and their allies were divided and despondent. Schumer in particular was berated by his party for allowing an earlier government funding bill to sail through the Senate without using it to challenge Trump. “What we are seeing from the Democrats is some spine,” said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a key organizing group. “The worst thing the Democrats could do right now is surrender.”  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Crowds gather to listen to Sen.

Remote infrastructure, including damaged runways and fragile foundations built on unstable permafrost, worsened response times. Evacuees were initially sheltered in schools and then moved to Bethel, which quickly reached capacity, before being flown to Anchorage. Many residents, especially Yup'ik people, face deep emotional and cultural challenges in leaving their ancestral homelands due to ties to subsistence hunting and traditional land use.

       By Sage Smiley \n        \n           Friday, October 17, 2025 • 4:02 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         In the late night hours of Oct. 11, the remnant of Typhoon Halong slammed Alaska's southwest coast, bringing hurricane-force winds and record flooding to numerous Alaska Native villages on the coast. Evacuees and rescuers describe massive destruction: utility poles snapped in half, boardwalks – the roads and sidewalks in many tundra villages – uprooted, houses floated off their foundations, some with families still inside. According to the state, more than a thousand people are displaced – some have no home to return to. One woman was  found dead , and  two of her family members remain missing . The state of Alaska's Emergency Operations Center is in its highest-possible level of emergency response. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has called for a federal disaster declaration for the region. Where is most affected? The remnant of Typhoon Halong had  sweeping impacts  across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta – an area in Western Alaska hundreds of miles from the U.S. road system and about the size of Oregon, with dozens of small villages scattered throughout. The coastal villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok took the brunt of the storm, and are being almost  entirely evacuated , per the State Emergency Operations Center. In addition, regional health officials have listed more than a dozen villages where  substantial damage  has been reported, and the state says that nearly 50 have reported some impacts. Damages are still being assessed and it's not clear yet how many people will be permanently displaced. Evacuations slowed and complicated by remoteness  Initially, many of the displaced  sheltered in schools throughout the region . But with heating, fuel, water, and sewer systems strained –  local officials said  it wasn't safe for people to stay. Emergency responders started to evacuate people to Bethel, the 6,500-person hub community of the region, which saw comparatively little damage from the storm. But the emergency shelter there reached capacity quickly. Within two days, displaced residents were being  flown to Anchorage,  400 air miles away. The evacuation process was significantly slowed by the remoteness of the area. With runways damaged in at least one village, some evacuations had to rely on helicopters. U.S. Coast Guard rescue crews  recounted moving people out of communities  six at a time. Buggy Carl, tribal administrator in Kipnuk, said despite the damage, it's daunting for community members to leave the place they have such deep history. The villages of the Kuskokwim Delta are the traditional homelands of  generations of Yup'ik people . \"I know their mindset, that their heart is here,\" he said on Oct. 15. \"They don't know anywhere else to go, because, you know, they grew up here. They have their own food throughout the year long, doing subsistence hunting. They just can't leave.\" That connection to land and food is a primary concern for many facing longer-term relocation. Some who've stayed behind in destroyed villages have done so with the goal of salvaging what subsistence foods they could – moose, musk ox, beluga, salmonberries, salmon, seal oil, emperor goose. Others speak of the heart-wrenching loss of ancestors' graves. In Kwigillingok, residents reported seeing unearthed coffins piled up at the end of the airport runway after the floodwaters receded. How was this typhoon remnant so destructive? Initially, climate models showed the remnant typhoon tracking north. But  according to Rick Thoman , an Alaska Climate Specialist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the storm picked up speed and shifted suddenly, taking its path right toward the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast. That was only a day and a half before the storm reached Alaska waters – a tight timeline for evacuation. This region is also on the forefront of climate change. Permafrost – or ground that is frozen year-round – underpins many of these villages and is thawing, leading to rapid erosion and instability. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium says nearly  150 communities  in Alaska – many in the Y-K Delta – will need to relocate fully or partially in the coming years because of permafrost thaw, land subsidence, erosion, or some other combination of climate-driven factors. The hundreds of square miles of tundra of the Delta are very close to sea level, and many communities don't have much high ground. And while some homes and buildings are built on pilings driven deep into the ground, many others sit on posts or other less stable foundations. These factors combine to make the land more vulnerable to storm-driven erosion, and structures more vulnerable to flood damage. What's next? If communities choose to rebuild, it will be difficult. It's expensive, and logistically complex, to get building materials out to these remote villages. The region is also still recovering from  major flooding in August of last year  – Kipnuk, one of the villages hardest hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, received one of the first-ever federal disaster  declarations for an Alaska tribe in the wake of that flooding .

home run rocketed off his bat and streaked toward the left-field bleachers, the few fans still sitting at Dodger Stadium rose frantically, as if every single seat in the sold-out building had received a shock. At the plate and on the mound, Ohtani was simply electrifying in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series while he conjured one of the greatest single-game performances in baseball history — perhaps even all of sports. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way superstar delivered the 13th three-homer game in postseason annals Friday night, connecting in the first, fourth and seventh innings for three epic solo shots traveling a combined 1,342 feet. He was similarly brilliant on the mound, throwing scoreless, two-hit ball into the seventh inning with 10 strikeouts and a masterful variety in his 100 pitches. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ohtani also did it all at an extraordinarily important moment for his team: The Dodgers’  5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers  sent the defending champions back to the World Series with a four-game sweep of the majors’ best regular-season squad. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 One win from first World Series, Mariners send Gilbert to mound in ALCS Game 6 at Toronto \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Blue Jays manager Schneider optimistic Springer will play ALCS Game 6 after pitch off knee \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The champion Dodgers are dominating October again.

And there’s a reason why he’s the greatest player on the planet. What he did on the mound, what he did at the bat, he created a lot of memories for a lot of people.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n After the raucous postgame celebration of the  Dodgers’ second straight NL pennant since he joined the club , Ohtani attempted to deflect some of the spotlight to his teammates. “There were times during the postseason where Teo (Teoscar Hernández) and Mookie (Betts) picked me up, and this time around, it was my turn to be able to perform,” Ohtani said through his interpreter. “And I think just looking back over the course of the entire postseason, I haven’t performed to the expectation, but I think today we saw what the left-handed hitters could do.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One left-handed hitter in particular carried the Dodgers to the World Series — and Ohtani, who reached base four times in four plate appearances, even identified the perfect capper to his historic evening. “This is really a team effort, so I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world can enjoy a really good sake,” said Ohtani, a connoisseur of the famed Japanese rice wine, while the crowd roared. Ohtani earned the NLCS MVP award almost solely on the strength of this one iconic game. He was 2 for 11 with a triple and three walks in the first three games of the series. He had been in an October slump by his lofty standards, going 6 for 38 in the postseason and sitting on an eight-game homer drought after hitting a franchise-record 55 in the regular season. That’s the nature of Ohtani’s boundless talent, however: He can transform into a sporting superhero seemingly whenever he chooses, and the mound was his telephone booth in Game 4. “The way he was struggling this postseason, and not to let it affect him and keep his psyche, his confidence, the same, is really impressive,” Roberts said. “So we knew that he was going to come through at some point. And what better night to do it while he was pitching, too.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n After Ohtani struck out three Brewers in the top of the first inning, he hit the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in major league history during the bottom half — and his night of incredible feats was just beginning. His second homer was a jaw-dropping, 469-foot drive that cleared the pavilion roof in right-center — a place where few homers ever land — after leaving his bat at 116.9 mph. His seventh-inning shot settled in the left-center bleachers and crushed the Brewers, who had finally chased him from the mound by getting two runners on in the top of the inning, only to go scoreless anyway when reliever Alex Vesia escaped the jam. The three-time MVP is the first player with a three-homer postseason game since Chris Taylor did it for the Dodgers in October 2021. Kiké Hernández, Ohtani’s current teammate, also accomplished the feat for Los Angeles in the 2017 NLCS. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ohtani became the third pitcher and first in 87 years to hit three homers in a game in which he was a starting pitcher, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The others were Jim Tobin for the Boston Braves on May 13, 1942, and Guy Hecker for Louisville on Aug. 15, 1886. Ohtani, who hadn’t gone deep since hitting two in Los Angeles’ playoff opener against Cincinnati, is the first Dodgers player with two multihomer games in one postseason. He also became the first player with two homers in any game with 116 mph or higher exit velocity since Statcast started tracking in 2015. And the right-hander was outstanding on the mound as well. He issued two early walks but didn’t allow a hit until Jackson Chourio led off the fourth with a ground-rule double. Ohtani stranded him with a grounder and two strikeouts. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He got two more punchouts in the fifth and sixth, with Dodgers fans rising for ovations each time he walked back to the dugout to exchange his glove for a bat. While his two-way role requires extensive off-field work to stay ready for both jobs, Ohtani had pitched in only two games over the past 30 days before Game 4, thanks to the permutations of the Dodgers’ schedule. In his last regular-season start, Ohtani pitched  six scoreless innings of five-hit ball  against Arizona on Sept. 23, throwing a season-high 91 pitches. In his MLB postseason mound debut Oct. 4, he gave up three runs over six innings with nine strikeouts  to earn the victory  in Los Angeles’ 5-3 win at Philadelphia in the Division Series opener. Ohtani also had the motivation of matching his fellow Dodgers starters, who have been phenomenal on the mound ever since the playoff race got serious. The Dodgers’ rotation held batters in September to an MLB record-low .173 average for a single month. Since the postseason began, Los Angeles’ four starting pitchers — Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani — have allowed just 10 earned runs while pitching 64 1/3 innings with 81 strikeouts over their 10 playoff games. Ohtani and the Dodgers have earned a week off before the World Series begins next Friday at either Toronto’s Rogers Centre against the Blue Jays or Chavez Ravine against the Seattle Mariners. This club has struggled with long layoffs in past postseasons, but Ohtani acknowledged he can use a break — and the Dodgers will spend at least the next couple of days basking in the brilliance they witnessed while punching their ticket to the Fall Classic. “I do see it as a positive in terms of being able to rest, both as a position player and as a pitcher,” Ohtani said. “We’ve had some off days, but we’ve played some very meaningful games that were very stressful.” ___ AP MLB:  https://apnews.com/MLB"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-governor-immigration-ciattarelli-trump-sherrill-4802fd86c36b7d9d0e804efd6368ed05","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:51:38+00:00","title":"New Jersey Governor Race: Ciattarelli’s Immigration Policy Amid Latino Voter Shift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 New Jersey governor’s race, Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli is attempting to appeal to Latino voters by advocating a 'pathway to recognition' for undocumented immigrants, which he describes as a first step toward citizenship.

(AP) — At a Spanish-speaking town hall, the Republican candidate for New Jersey governor assured two young Mexican immigrants who were brought to the United States as children that people without criminal records would not face deportation. Three nights later, Jack Ciattarelli headlined a “Make America Great Again”-style event where a far-right commentator joked about building a detention center like  Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz”  in the Garden State.  “How about the Boardwalk Brig?” Jack Posobiec said with a laugh as he spoke later that evening at the rally. Ciattarelli, an unabashed ally of Donald Trump, recently gave the Republican president an  “A” grade  for his performance in the White House. But as Ciattarelli courts Latino voters in a hard-fought race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill, the former business owner and state legislator has put some distance from Trump on the president’s signature issue of immigration.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Expressing support for issuing driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers to people who are in the U.S. illegally, Ciattarelli has tried to strike a balance between supporters of Trump’s mass deportation strategy and Latino voters that the GOP nominee thinks could be persuaded to support him. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 No. 8 Oregon follows first loss with 56-10 romp over Rutgers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Connor Brown ‘lit up like a Christmas tree’ after scoring for the Devils against the Oilers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Jack Hughes scores 2 goals as the Devils win their 4th in a row by beating the Oilers 5-3 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n In recent appearances in a Univision forum and in the  final debate of the campaign , Ciattarelli promoted not a path to citizenship, as immigration advocates have pushed for years, but what he called a “pathway to recognition,” which he later described as a first step toward citizenship. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n It’s a high-stakes gambit in one of two states with governor’s races this year — Virginia is the other — but it’s rooted in Trump’s improved performance among Latino voters last year. In New Jersey, for example, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns where he had lost by more than 30 percentage and 50 percentage points, respectively, in 2016. While the state typically votes Democratic in Senate and presidential election years, and Trump has lost it in all three of his White House runs, it has swung back and forth between parties in odd-year contests for governor. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ciattarelli’s more lenient stance toward some immigrants emerges amid Trump’s all-out effort to increase deportations, even among those with no criminal record beyond violating immigration laws. Ciattarelli has softened his position in some respects, but he also has made clear that he wants New Jersey law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials. Sherrill, a congresswoman in her fourth term, has hammered Trump throughout the race, casting herself as a bulwark against the administration. But she has not made immigration a campaign emphasis. Ciattarelli navigates the delicate politics of immigration Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly and in local office before that, had been critical of Trump during the run-up to the 2016 election. While serving in the Legislature, he supported a bill that provided for in-state tuition for certain immigrants without lawful status.  In the governor’s race, he has aligned himself with Trump on at least some of the president’s immigration policies. Ciattarelli has also said that, if elected, his first executive order would be to repeal the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which prohibits police from cooperating on civil immigration enforcement matters. He also has expressed opposition to giving birthright citizenship to children born to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n During a debate with Sherrill last week, Ciattarelli said he agreed with Trump that anyone with a “history of criminality” should be deported, as well as anyone who “committed a crime or scam.” But he broke with Trump slightly when he said: “I believe that everyone else should be put on a pathway to recognition.” In front of Spanish-speaking audiences, Ciattarelli has boasted of supporting in-state tuition to students without lawful status, a practice that has been targeted by the Trump administration.  “I do not believe that anyone should be living in the shadows. If we’re giving you a pathway to recognition, that to me starts with some form of government issued ID including driver’s license,” Ciattarelli said in the Univision forum, fielding translated questions in Spanish from New Jersey residents, which he answered in English. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Why does it matter? Ciattarelli is hoping to reach a key constituency in the state, where Trump cut into Democrats’ edge with  Latino voters  in 2024, as he did across the board in New Jersey. Voter unease about the economy is sure to be central to that effort. New Jersey Democrats, too, have largely shifted their focus to the economy and driving down costs with polls showing inflation was a top concern among Hispanics. About 1 in 5 residents in New Jersey are Hispanic, according to the census.  Trump lost New Jersey last November to Democrat Kamala Harris by just 6 percentage points — a shift from his nearly 13-point deficit to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among Latino voters, Trump’s support went from 28% in 2020 to 43% in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n How the shift sits with Republicans Republicans who enthusiastically embraced the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration may disagree with Ciattarelli’s views, but many still back him.  “There are certain people it might deter,” said Ed Durr, a former state senator and Ciattarelli’s  primary foe  who now backs him. “There are hard-liners who are going to see that as acquiescent to the Democrats.” Still other Republicans say his policy looks good compared with the position taken by leading New Jersey Democrats. Mario Kranjac, another  former primary opponent  in the governor’s race who has embraced Trump, invoked Sherrill, U.S. Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. “Mikie, Cory, Andy, Josh and their fellow Democrats support sanctuary cities and illegal immigration which foster crime and unnecessary expense,” he said. “While Jack doesn’t.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment on claims by Ciattarelli that he would be able to work with the Trump administration to exempt deportations of people without criminal records. Outside a campaign stop at a pizzeria earlier this week, Ciattarelli repeated that some people should not be deported and should instead be brought out “from the shadows.” A request to the campaign to clarify how he reconciles his position with the president’s was not answered. ‘He is pretending to care’ Sherrill reacted to Ciattarelli’s “pathway to recognition” with skepticism.  “That’s not really a real thing. That doesn’t confer any status to anyone,” she said during the debate. She has promoted her background as a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted criminals, in addition to her work on federal legislation to create opportunities for citizenship.  She summed up their difference this way: “At the end of the day, he’s always going to do what Trump tells him to do.” Asked repeatedly if she would keep the Immigrant Trust Directive in place, Sherrill has said only that she would enforce the law.  Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who is advising Sherrill, said Ciattarelli is trying to “sound compassionate” toward Latinos who are increasingly worried the Trump administration is scaling up its actions against immigrants and affecting Hispanic businesses as a result. “He is pretending to care about immigrants and be compassionate, but he is not giving you facts,” Campos-Medina said. “We all should be asking, ‘How are you going to protect data from the Donald Trump machine? New Jersey already recognizes immigrants. How are you going to keep that promise?’” ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/national-education-equity-lab-nonprofit-carnegie-corporation-a762da7d96c9a70dd1fa8ae4468f1e7f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"13:07:16+00:00","title":"National Education Opportunity Network Expands to Serve 1 Million Low-Income Students by 2035","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Leslie Cornfeld, a former federal civil rights prosecutor and education advisor, identified a critical educational inequity: despite elite universities recruiting top athletes from low-income backgrounds, they remain largely inaccessible to high-achieving low-income students.

That’s what Leslie Cornfeld decided after a decade advising New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s two education secretaries — and seeing how few low-income students went to the universities that lead to high-paying jobs. Cornfeld said she spent part of her time in the Obama administration visiting the nation’s Title I high schools, those with a high percentage of low-income students. She recalled: “We heard the same themes over and over again from principals, district leaders and students. That even the most talented, hard-working scholars — in rural communities, poor urban communities, Native American communities — cannot get on the radar of more selective universities.” And even if they could get on their radar, students did not believe that they were college-ready or college-worthy, Cornfeld said. Meanwhile, when she and her Washington colleagues met with higher education leaders, they repeatedly claimed, “We wish that we could find talented lower income scholars but we just can’t find them.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n For Cornfeld, this made no sense, since universities seemed to have had no trouble finding the very best athletes, often from low-income backgrounds, to play on their teams.

Cornfeld decided to connect the dots and bring elite universities into non-elite schools. By fall 2019, with a staff of three, the Lab was delivering Harvard College poetry class to two dozen high schools. The Lab simultaneously developed a range of supports: connecting professors with students by Zoom; training high school teachers as course co-teachers; and hiring college undergraduates as course teaching fellows and mentors in applying to and navigating college. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Over the past five years, the Equity Lab, now called the National Education Opportunity Network, or NEON,  reports  it has brought 60 college credit-bearing courses from 17 universities to more than 40,000 high school students in 33 states — with 80 percent of students passing the courses. NEON is currently in every Title I school in Jackson, Mississippi, 120 Title I schools in New York City and has plans to matriculate 1 million Title I high schools into online college courses within a decade.  Should NEON’s goal be achieved, it would surpass the number of low-income students  annually taking Advanced Placement tests . Sixty percent of A.P. exams taken by low-income students in 2023 scored too low for college credit, a statistic that has not budged in 20 years, according to  reporting from the New York Times . “We are a very different animal than A.P.,” Cornfeld said. “We are serving low-income, underresourced scholars and this model was developed for them. We are bringing colleges into the schools and changing the culture.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A lean nonprofit Although the National Education Opportunity Network has large ambitions, it remains small in two significant ways. The nonprofit has only 32 full-time staff, and its annual revenue in 2024 was just $7.5 million. Carnegie has provided NEON two more grants — $200,000 in 2021 and $3 million this year. And over the past six years, NEON has  attracted funds  from the Bill & Melinda Gates, NBA, Apollo and Morgan Stanley foundations, among others. NEON also has attracted support from individuals. The biggest benefactor among them is venture capitalist Henry McCance. “My VC background very much focuses on backing the best people,” McCance said, noting Cornfeld’s background as a federal civil rights prosecutor. McCance was also impressed by the NEON’s model, which connects existing, paid-for college courses with existing, paid-for government employees at high schools. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “That gave them the ability to really start influencing thousands of students with relatively limited resources,” McCance said. While some large-scale private interventions — like Mark Zuckerberg’s  $100 million investment in Newark public schools  and the Gates Foundation’s  $1 billion Small Schools Initiative  — have stumbled, McCance noted that NEON has fared better by starting small and proving its model. “Then they could go to other universities, other school districts and show them the success they had in the last year and build on it,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n 512 high schools and counting NEON’s model is not without hurdles. Celeste Pico, principal of Lompoc High School in California decided to introduce two NEON courses to increase college-prep offerings after the pandemic. “We’d be lying to you if we told you this has not taken a lot of time,” Pico said. “But we knew it was in the best interest of our students, because it’s more than having access to those classes — it’s helped close the gap for a lot of our students financially.” Increasingly, NEON learners are entering college having finished one year of university-level courses, Pico said. In 2024-’25, Lompoc offered six NEON courses, eliminating several A.P. classes, in part because the A.P. grade is based on only one test. Adrienne Battle, superintendent of the Metro Nashville Public Schools in Tennessee, has also scaled up NEON courses in her district. “We’ve received quite a high positive-response rate and requests from not only our school teams but also from our students and parents,” she said, adding that she plans to expand NEON offerings in “all 12 of my zoned high schools.” Closing the confidence gap Marah Rigaud is a first-generation Haitian American who took five NEON courses at her high school in Long Island, N.Y., and now attends Yale. “Hearing these big names like Yale, Harvard, Georgetown can appear intimidating at first,” she said. “And when you don’t have that experience, you kind of feel a bit behind and thinking that college is some kind of impossible feat. These courses give you a foundation.” Rigaud is one of the more than 10,000 students whose post-secondary outcomes NEON is tracking through a study by Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins. After five years of  data analysis , Balfanz found that NEON students who pass a course are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges than students from similar high schools — and also persist in college at higher rates. Can the National Education Opportunity Network reach its goal of serving 1 million students within 10 years? Cornfeld thinks so because demand for NEON courses is “higher than ever,” she said, with more than 35 new districts reaching out to join the network. McCance, NEON’s biggest individual funder, said, “I’ve never actually thought of whether the goal is precisely achievable or not,” but “one hurdle, quite frankly, is capital.” ______ Tamara Straus  is senior editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the  full article .

(AP) — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that it has “credible reports” that Hamas could violate the  ceasefire  with an attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.  If the attack takes place, it “would constitute a direct and grave violation” of the agreement forged by President Donald Trump to end the  two-year war between Israel and Hamas , the statement said. No further details were disclosed about the potential attack. ”Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” the State Department said. Trump previously warned on social media that “if Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.” The U.S. president later clarified he won’t send U.S. troops into Gaza after launching the threat against Hamas. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’s not going to be us,” he told reporters. “We won’t have to.

After emails emerged this week showing that  Prince Andrew  remained in contact with the convicted sex offender  Jeffrey Epstein  longer than he previously admitted, the House of Windsor finally moved to insulate the monarchy from years of  tawdry headlines  about Andrew’s dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.  Buckingham Palace on Friday released a statement from Andrew saying that he had agreed to give up use of his last remaining royal titles so that continued allegations about him “don’t distract from the work of His Majesty.” This week’s revelations demonstrated that Andrew had committed the unforgivable sin of misleading the British public, said Craig Prescott, an expert on the monarchy and constitutional law at Royal Holloway University of London. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “To say something which is proven not to be true, I think, is the straw that broke the camel’s back,’’ he said. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     A selection of British national newspapers showing the front pages and their reaction to Prince Andrew announcing that he will relinquish his Duke of York title and the Order of the Garter, amid ongoing problems in his personal life, in London, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

William recently gave an interview in which he set out his vision for the monarchy, saying that the institution needed to change to make sure that it is a force for good. “In some ways, Prince Andrew has been the exact opposite of that,” Prescott said. “And there is no space for that in the modern monarchy.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Andrew, 65, is the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.

That was triggered by a disastrous interview Andrew gave to the BBC as he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a  17-year-old girl, Virginia Giuffre,  who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The prince was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier. The interview also sowed the seeds of this week’s upheaval, when Andrew told the BBC that he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010. British newspapers on Sunday revealed that Andrew wrote an email to Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew wrote the note after renewed reporting on the Epstein scandal, telling him they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.” Andrew has recently faced another round of grimy stories as newspapers release excerpts of Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which will be published on Tuesday. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement  with Giuffre  after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations, Giuffre’s family saw the surrender of the use of his titles as validation for her memoir’s claims that the prince acted like sex was his birthright. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears today,” her brother, Sky Roberts, told the BBC. “In a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     From left, Britain’s Prince Andrew, Prince William, Prince Charles, Kate Duchess of Cambridge, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry arrive to attend a Christmas Service at St Mary’s church on the grounds of Sandringham Estate, the Queen’s Norfolk retreat, England, Dec. 25, 2011.

The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain. Last year, a court case revealed Andrew’s relationship with a businessman and  suspected Chinese spy  who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the  man could have misused his influence  over Andrew, according to court documents.

The visit is very important to Charles, who has made the bridging of faiths an important part of his “mantra,” said George Gross, an expert on theology and the monarchy at King’s College, London. “I think this was the speediest, really the quickest way of lowering his status even more without having to go to Parliament,” Gross said. “Even if Parliament would have approved, it takes time.’’ Charles may also have been motivated by a desire to protect the work of Queen Camilla, who has made combating domestic violence one of her signature issues, and the Duchess of Edinburgh, who has sought to combat sexual violence in war zones such as Congo. The king will hope that this move finally draws a line between Andrew and the rest of the royal family, Prescott said. “If there are allegations, or further stuff comes out, it will all be on Prince Andrew,” he said. “They’ve severed the connection between Prince Andrew and the monarchy as an institution.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/yemen-ship-gulf-of-aden-houthis-25543875a66516c99ec937952542972f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"11:42:10+00:00","title":"Cameroonian-flagged tanker caught in fire off Yemen, possibly after projectile strike","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Cameroonian-flagged tanker named the Falcon caught fire in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen on October 18, 2025, with at least one crew member missing and another possibly still aboard.

Aden off Yemen after possibly being struck by a projectile, officials said, with at least one mariner missing and another still likely aboard the burning tanker after the rest of the crew abandoned the vessel. U.K. and European Union officials offered differing opinions about what sparked the blaze on the Falcon, with the British suggesting a projectile hit it, while the EU said that it appeared to be “an accident.” They warned ships in the area that the vessel could explode, because it was “fully loaded” with liquefied petroleum gas.  The incident comes as Yemen’s  Houthi rebels  have been attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor. However, the rebels didn’t immediately claim to have been involved, though it can take them hours or even days to do so.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, or UKMTO, center issued an alert about the Falcon, describing the incident as taking place around 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Aden.  “A vessel has been hit by an unknown projectile, resulting with a fire,” the UKMTO said. “Authorities are investigating.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Germany’s Munich Airport temporarily closed following drone reports, but nothing found \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Turkish Cypriots vote in an election seen as a choice on deeper Turkey ties or closer EU relations \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Thousands rally in Albanian capital against EU-backed court prosecuting Kosovo war veterans \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n The EU’s Operation Aspides, which has been patrolling the area, said that the Falcon’s crew of 26 was all Indian except for one Ukrainian.

The Houthis have gained international prominence during the Israel-Hamas war over their attacks on shipping and Israel, which they said were aimed at forcing Israel to stop fighting. Since the  ceasefire began on Oct. 10 , no attacks have been claimed by the rebel group.  The  Houthi campaign  against shipping has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk. It upended  shipping in the Red Sea , through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The rebels’ most recent attack hit the Dutch-flagged  cargo ship Minervagracht  on Sept. 29, killing one crew member on board and wounding another. Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence they were spies — something fiercely denied by the world body and others."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-military-strikes-drugs-caribbean-ecuador-colombia-c1d4c025e1dfe21cc7ee67d7aa4e05bd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"18:42:07+00:00","title":"Trump Announces Repatriation of Survivors from U.S. Caribbean Strike on Suspected Drug Submarine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean have been repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia.

The military rescued the pair after striking a submersible vessel Thursday, in what was at least the sixth such attack since early September.  “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump said in a social media post. “U.S. Intelligence confirmed this vessel was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics.” After Trump’s announcement, the Pentagon posted on X a brief black-and-white video of the strike. In the clip, a vessel can be seen moving through the waves, its front portion submerged inches below the water’s surface. Then, several explosions are seen, with at least one over the back of the vessel. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Republican president said two people onboard were killed — one more than was previously reported — and the two who survived are being sent to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israel identifies bodies of 2 hostages as Gaza border crossing with Egypt remains closed \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Pope gives Venezuela reason to celebrate by canonizing its beloved ‘doctor of the poor’ as 1st saint \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Bolivia heads to the polls in a tight runoff as voters seek a president to lift them from crisis \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Colombian President Gustavo Petro confirmed Saturday on X that the Colombian man who was detained aboard what he called a “narco submarine” was home. “We are glad he is alive, and he will be prosecuted according to the law,” Petro wrote in a brief post. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The press office for Ecuador’s government said Saturday it was not immediately aware of plans for repatriation. With Trump’s statement on his Truth Social platform of the death toll, that means U.S. military action against vessels in the region have killed at least 29 people.  The president has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is  engaged in an “armed conflict”  with drug cartels. He is relying on the same legal authority used by the George W. Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks, and that includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership. Trump is also treating the suspected traffickers as if they were enemy soldiers in a traditional war. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The repatriation avoids questions for the Trump administration about what the legal status of the two would have been in the U.S. justice system. It may also sidestep some of the legal issues that arose out of the detention of enemy combatants in the global war on terrorism as well as challenges to the constitutionality of the current operation. To some legal scholars, Trump’s use of such military force against suspect drug cartels, along with his authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law. On Friday, Trump seemed to confirm reports that Maduro has offered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to try to stave off mounting pressure from the United States. Venezuelan government officials have also floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office, according to a former Trump administration official. That plan was also rejected by the White House, The Associated Press reported. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among members of Congress from both parties and complaints about receiving insufficient information on how the attacks are being conducted. But most Republican senators backed the administration last week on a measure that would have required Trump’s team to get approval from Congress before more strikes. Meanwhile, another resolution to be considered would prevent Trump from outright attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization. ___ Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Florida."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-pakistan-taliban-qatar-ceasefire-5644c17728ef48434e50e6e8be49294b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:34:42+00:00","title":"Afghanistan and Pakistan agree to immediate ceasefire, mediated by Qatar and Turkey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey, following weeks of escalating violence along their disputed 2,611-kilometer border.

Entry from Afghanistan, including trade and pedestrian movement, remains suspended.  Shafiullah Khan, an Afghan refugee trying to leave Pakistan, had been stuck at Chaman for three days.  “We are so happy for this peace agreement,” said Khan. “The refugees were suffering a lot, but now, after this agreement, we are happy and are going back to our country.” Less happy was businessman Hazarat Bilal Umaid, whose trade depends on an open border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  “People were afraid and worried about how to save their livelihoods,” he said. “Now our request to both governments is to open the gate for trade as soon as possible.” The  Torkham crossing , which straddles Pakistan’s northwest and Afghanistan’s east, is completely closed.  —— Associated Press writers Abdul Qahar Afghan in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Sajjad Tarakzai in Islamabad and Abdul Sattar in Quetta, Pakistan, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/france-louvre-museum-robbery-a3687f330a43e0aaff68c732c4b2585b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"09:46:25+00:00","title":"Thieves Break Into Louvre Museum, Steal Crown Jewels in 7-Minute Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, thieves carried out a brazen seven-minute heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, using a basket lift and disc cutter to break into the Galerie d’Apollon, where they stole nine pieces from the French Crown Jewels, including a broken crown believed to belong to Empress Eugénie.

2025-10-19T09:46:25+00:00\n\nPARIS (AP) — In a brazen, seven-minute strike, thieves used a basket lift to reach the Louvre on Sunday morning and, as tourists were already inside, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with jewels of “inestimable value,” France’s interior minister said.  The world’s most visited museum closed for the day as police sealed gates and ushered visitors out during the investigation. “A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the  Louvre Museum ,” Culture Minister Rachida Dati wrote on X. The museum cited “exceptional reasons” for the closure. No injuries were reported. Around 9:30 a.m. several intruders forced open a window, stole jewels from vitrines and escaped on two-wheelers, according to the Interior Ministry. It said forensic work is underway and a precise inventory of the stolen objects is being compiled, adding that the items have “inestimable” historical value. Dati and Nuñez were on site with museum leadership. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Video from the scene showed confused tourists being ushered out of the glass pyramid and surrounding courtyards as officers shut the iron gates and closed nearby streets along the Seine. \n\n Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez called it a “major robbery,” saying the intruders entered from the outside using a basket lift. He said on France Inter radio that the heist took seven minutes and the thieves used a disc cutter to slice through the panes. He said it was “manifestly a team that had done scouting.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The heist occurred in the Galerie d’Apollon, a vaulted hall in the Denon wing that displays part of the French Crown Jewels beneath a ceiling painted by King Louis XIV’s court artist, according to the ministry.  French daily Le Parisien reported the thieves entered via the Seine-facing facade, where construction is underway, and used a freight elevator to reach the gallery. After breaking windows, they reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. One stolen jewel was later found outside the museum, the paper reported, adding that the item was believed to be Empress Eugénie’s crown and that it had been broken. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Security and staffing at the Louvre in the spotlight  Security around marquee works remains tight. The Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass and a custom high-tech display system as part of broader anti-theft measures across the museum. Staffing and protection have been flashpoints at the Louvre. The museum delayed opening during a  June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing . Unions have warned that mass tourism strains security and visitor management.  It wasn’t immediately clear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday’s theft.  In January, President Emmanuel Macron announced a decadelong “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — roughly €700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece its own dedicated gallery by 2031 — but workers say relief has been slow to reach the floor. Other European museums have been robbed  The theft, less than half an hour after doors opened, echoes other recent European museum raids.  In 2019, thieves smashed vitrines in Dresden’s Green Vault and carried off diamond-studded royal jewels worth hundreds of millions of euros. In 2017, burglars at Berlin’s Bode Museum stole a 100-kilogram (220-pound) solid-gold coin. In 2010, a lone intruder slipped into Paris’s Museum of Modern Art and escaped with five paintings, including a Picasso. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when  the Mona Lisa  vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence — an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait the world’s best-known artwork. Home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters — the Louvre’s star attractions include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The museum can draw up to 30,000 visitors a day."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-pakistan-cricket-border-fighting-232bb8c59918af77a92b6d16e4adb52b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:58:09+00:00","title":"Afghanistan and Pakistan Agree to Ceasefire After Deadly Cross-Border Fighting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following a week of deadly cross-border fighting, marking the most serious crisis between the two nations in years.

Afghanistan denies harboring militants who carry out attacks in border areas.  Pakistan is grappling with militancy that has surged since 2021, when the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan and returned to power. The fighting threatened to further destabilize a region where groups including the  Islamic State group  and  al-Qaida  are trying to resurface. Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst, said the ceasefire gave the two sides “more breathing room” to think about what to do next. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Police looking into whether Prince Andrew enlisted officer to dig up dirt on accuser Giuffre \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 North Korean soldier defects to South Korea across the rivals’ heavily fortified border \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Thieves strike Louvre in daring jewel heist as the world’s most visited museum shuts \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n But the problem was that the core driver of the crisis remained, Kugelman warned. “The Taliban are not addressing Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism,” he said. “And they’re denying they’re even a part of the problem.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Aerial strikes trigger condemnation, boycott A 48-hour ceasefire intended  to pause hostilities expired Friday evening.

The targets were hideouts of the militant Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. One said the operation was a direct response to the suicide bombing of a  security forces compound in Mir Ali , in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province a day earlier. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Pakistani Air Force raids killed dozens of armed fighters and there were no civilian deaths, they said.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, had earlier criticized the “repeated crimes of Pakistani forces and the violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty.”  Such acts were deemed provocative and viewed as “deliberate attempts” to prolong the conflict, he added. The two countries share a 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) border known as the  Durand Line , but Afghanistan has never recognized it.  Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, urged Afghans to choose “mutual security over perpetual violence and progress over hardline obscurantism.” “The Taliban must rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” he told an audience at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as high-level delegations from both countries arrived in the Qatari capital on Saturday for the negotiations. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Locals inspect the site of a cross-border attack by the Pakistani army in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025.

schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries. In August, it all ended. When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.   “I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’ President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money.

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.  In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth  “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.’’ Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The  September jobs report has been delayed  by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump’s immigration and trade policies,  downgraded its forecast  for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ‘We need these people’ Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin. “That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’ Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.” Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The ICE crackdown Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion’’ at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible. The law pours  $150 billion into immigration enforcement , setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.  And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have. The incident enraged the South Koreans and  ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers  to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained. Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters. But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has  stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum. “You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’ Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born  Medicaid recipients could head to the fields  to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’ The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.  “The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’ “You’re not welcome here’’ Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May. “Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’ Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000. “A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’  Some are already packing up. In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders. The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said. _____ Wiseman reported from Washington and Salomon from Miami.

(AP) — Israel identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight, as the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun, despite strikes traded between Israel and militants in southern Gaza on Sunday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker killed at Kibbutz Be’eri. Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and their bodies were taken to Gaza. Engel’s wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire in November 2023. Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the  Rafah border crossing  between Gaza and Egypt closed “until further notice.” The statement by Netanyahu’s office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28  deceased hostages . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In the past week, Hamas has handed over the remains of 13 bodies, 12 of which have been identified as hostages.

Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry has posted photos of dozens of bodies on its website to help families and relatives attempting to locate their loved ones, but the bodies were decomposed, blackened and some were missing limbs and teeth. Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n After Israel and Hamas exchanged 20 living hostages for more than 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the handover of the remains of deceased hostages and prisoners remains a major issue in the first stage of the  ceasefire proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump . A major scale-up of aid, including the opening of the Rafah border crossing, for humanitarian aid and people entering or leaving Gaza, is the other central issue. The next stages of the ceasefire will focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Second phase The Israeli military said on Sunday that militants shot at troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in the Israeli-controlled areas, according to the agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A senior Hamas official denied that Hamas was involved. Hamas and Israel have each accused each other of violating the fragile ceasefire.  Meanwhile, Hamas says that talks with mediators to start the second phase of the ceasefire have begun.  Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesman, said in a statement late Saturday that the second phase of negotiations “requires national consensus.” He also said Hamas has begun discussions to “solidify its positions,” without providing further details.  According to Trump’s plan, the negotiations will include disarming Hamas and the establishment of an internationally backed authority to run the embattled Gaza Strip. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Kassem reiterated that the group won’t be part of the ruling authority in a postwar Gaza. Hamas-run government bodies in the Gaza Strip are running day-to-day affairs to avoid a power void, he said. “Government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the vacuum is very dangerous, and this will continue until an administrative committee is formed and agreed upon by all Palestinian factions,” he said. Kassem called for a Community Support Committee, a body of Palestinian technocrats, to run the day-to-day affairs, to be established promptly.  Rafah border crossing  Israel didn’t open the Rafah border crossing on Sunday, in an attempt to pressure Hamas to return more hostages’ bodies. Hamas says it needs special equipment to locate the bodies of additional hostages, but Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.  The Rafah crossing was the only one not controlled by Israel before  the war . It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority’s Interior Ministry in Ramallah announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. For those who want to leave Gaza, Palestinian Embassy staff from Cairo will be at the crossing to issue temporary travel documents that allow entry into Egypt. Palestinians who wish to enter the Gaza Strip will need to apply at the embassy in Cairo for relevant entry documents. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the territory. Its figures  are seen as a reliable estimate  of wartime deaths by U.N. agencies and many independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war. Hamas rejects US claim The group rejected on Sunday a claim by the U.S. State Department that said it had credible  reports of an imminent planned attack  by Hamas against residents of Gaza. “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement Saturday.  Hamas called the claim “false allegations,” and accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and “providing them a safe haven.” Hamas-led fighters  clashed with at least two armed groups  in eastern Gaza City that the group alleges are involved in looting aid and collaborating with Israel. They executed a handful of suspects in public, in widely condemned street killings.  The Interior Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, says its forces were working to restore law and order across areas Israel’s military withdrew from following the ceasefire. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-saints-pope-vatican-hernandez-c2828accedb39bcc96c9b1f8614c95d3","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"06:36:12+00:00","title":"Pope Leo XIV Canonizes Venezuela’s 'Doctor of the Poor', First Saint in Nation's History","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV canonized José Gregorio Hernández, Venezuela’s beloved 'doctor of the poor,' in a major ceremony that marked the nation’s first saint and offered a moment of national unity amid deepening economic crisis, political instability, and rising tensions with the United States.

of the poor” Sunday before tens of thousands of people, offering the South American nation its first saint and a reason to celebrate amid a yearslong economic crisis and new tensions with the United States. José Gregorio Hernández , revered by millions for his dedication to poor people, was declared a saint alongside Mother Carmen Rendiles Martínez, the founder of a Venezuelan religious order, at a Mass in St. Peter’s Square that Leo called a “great celebration of holiness.”  Thousands of jubilant Venezuelans filled the square and draped Venezuelan flags on its police barricades, adding splashes of red, blue and yellow that perfectly matched the uniforms of the attending Swiss Guards. Thousands more who couldn’t travel to Rome marked the occasion in Caracas, where the Vatican service was livestreamed before dawn at a downtown plaza. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Mass, which the Vatican said drew some 70,000 people, also gave Papua New Guinea its first saint: Peter To Rot, a layman killed in prison in 1945 for standing up for monogamous marriage at a time when polygamy was practiced. In all, seven people were canonized in a ceremony that Pope Francis put in motion in some of his final acts as pope. In fact,  Francis approved Hernández’s canonization  from his hospital room on Feb. 24, agreeing to bypass the Vatican’s typical miracle confirmation process to pronounce him a saint based on the “widespread veneration of the ‘doctor-saint’ among the faithful,” the Vatican said. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A beloved doctor and an icon after death Hernández is beloved among Venezuelans, with his face plastered on street art around Caracas, in portraits in hospitals and in photos gracing individual home altars.  As a doctor in Caracas during the late 1800s and early 1900s, he refused to take money from poor people for his services and often gave them money for medicine, earning the nickname “doctor of the poor.” He was killed in 1919 while crossing a street shortly after picking up some medicine at a pharmacy to bring to a poor elderly woman.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He became a religious icon after his death, and when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela in 1996, he received a petition signed by 5 million people — almost one in four Venezuelans — asking that he declare Hernández a saint. “For them, this is indeed a national event of the highest order,” said Silvia Correale, who spearheaded his sainthood case. “Certainly, the canonization of José Gregorio is desired by all the Venezuelan people, and has been waited for by all the people.” Josè Ramon Malavecontreras, a Venezuelan resident in Rome, said his mother named him after Hernández and attended his canonization Sunday.  “They believed I’d be stillborn, so she dedicated his name to me for saving my life,” he said Sunday. “Therefore, this moment was unmissable for me. I couldn’t fail to be here.” In Caracas, Arquímides Blanco, 60, said he wasn’t a particular fan of Hernández but recognized the significance of his canonization for Venezuela now. Blanco belongs to a cultural collective commissioned to paint the streets surrounding Caracas’ emblematic parish of La Pastora ahead of the canonization. “I may not be a big fan of José Gregorio as such, but I understand that he is Venezuelan and that his canonization in the context of the whole geopolitical situation is important,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A celebration amid tensions The canonization was a long-awaited celebration and a boost for Venezuela, just weeks after Venezuelan opposition leader  María Corina Machado  won the  Nobel Peace Prize.  It comes as tensions mount with the United States over Washington’s use of military force against suspected drug cartels. Just this past week, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that he  authorized the CIA  to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela and said he was weighing the execution of land operations in the South American country. Venezuela’s economy has been in crisis for the past decade, compounded by U.S. sanctions and spurring the emigration of millions of Venezuelans, first to other South American nations and then, in more recent years, to the United States.  The government of President Nicólas Maduro – sworn in last year despite credible evidence he lost reelection — has been forced to cut subsidies, making many daily necessities unaffordable to the 80% of residents estimated to live in poverty. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Other new saints In his homily, Leo held up all seven new saints as models for today’s Catholics who carried “the lamp of the faith.” “May their intercession assist us in our trials and their example inspire us in our shared vocation to holiness,” he said. Also canonized Sunday were Archbishop Ignazio Choukrallah Maloyan, an Armenian Catholic who was killed for refusing to renounce his faith during what the Vatican has said was the Ottoman era genocide of Armenians; Sister Vincenza Maria Poloni, a 19th century founder of a religious order; Sister Maria Troncatti, an Italian missionary in Ecuador, and Bartolo Longo, who like Hernandez was canonized based on widespread veneration among the faithful, not a purported miraculous healing. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ___ Arraez reported from Caracas, Venezuela.

and other ruling Communist Party elites gather in Beijing to map out the goals for the next five years. The closed-door gathering — known as the fourth plenum — is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China’s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030.  The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month.

Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend. The gathering also may coincide with personnel changes. Since it’s held behind closed doors, details may come days or weeks later.  Such gatherings are meant to help unite officials and the public behind the party’s agenda. The full five-year plan for 2026-2030 and specifics will likely not be released until the annual session of the National People’s Congress is held in March. But there is little reason to expect a radical shift away from the format and messaging style of previous five-year plans, Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said in an interview. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n What to expect in China’s next ‘five-year plan’ The world’s second-largest economy is forecast to expand by 4.8% this year, according to the World Bank, a figure close to China’s official target of about 5% growth. China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.  Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China’s push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.  China’s pursuit of technological “self-sufficiency,” weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs. That could result in more spending on advanced technology, said Ning Zhang, a senior China economist at UBS. One key question is whether there will be any meaningful shift in the leadership’s approach to boosting consumption, said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics. The government has adopted incremental policy moves — such as increased government subsidies for childcare, consumer loans, and trade-in programs for appliances and electric vehicles. Boosting consumption, which would drive borrowing and demand, is “much more important than before” but consumer confidence has been undermined by the bursting of China’s property bubble several years ago, Zhang explained. Economists say bolder moves are needed to make a significant difference. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Price wars in the auto industry are an example of the risks of the ferocious competition that results from overcapacity that afflicts many Chinese industries. China’s exports — including to Southeast Asia and Africa — have surged as companies seek markets beyond its borders, adding to friction with the United States and other trading partners.  China’s chief challenges in the next five years Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen. Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care. “Overall, China’s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,” she wrote. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While it faces increasing friction with the U.S. and other trading partners, China is also running up against demographic pressures, as its population of 1.4 billion begins to shrink and age more rapidly. The unemployment rate for young workers aged 16-24 is nearly 19%, according to official data, impinging on their potential contributions to the economy. The Chinese leadership has set a goal of doubling the size of China’s economy in 2020 by 2035, and like any other government, “still cares (about) growth and is still trying to get richer,” said Zhang of UBS.  He estimates that keeping the economy growing at a robust 4% to 5% pace in the next decade will likely be “challenging.” But it’s imperative to show it is striving for such ambitious goals, to demonstrate the ruling party’s capacity to keep delivering a better quality of life — its chief claim to its legitimacy.  “For China’s leadership, what do they care about? Stability, legitimacy, and also ongoing support,” he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/morocco-gen-z-protests-soccer-654e45f09636365e9ae2f5b4e0ff6abb","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:36:45Z","title":"Gen Z protests in Morocco demand social reforms as stadium construction draws criticism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Morocco, youth-led protests under the Gen Z 212 movement have intensified in response to widespread dissatisfaction with government priorities, particularly the construction of stadiums for the 2030 FIFA World Cup and the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.

of fanfare around  December’s Africa Cup of Nations  overshadow their demands,  protesters in Morocco  urged a boycott of soccer matches at the country’s new stadiums. On Saturday, they reiterated previous demands and called for the release of demonstrators arrested during earlier Gen Z 212 protests. After an eight-day pause,  hundreds of young demonstrators  took to the streets on Saturday as part of an effort to show they remained committed to protesting corruption and subpar healthcare and education. In several cities -- including Casablanca and Tangier -- hundreds of young protesters once again voiced anger at elected officials, demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch, who they called corrupt. The protests, smaller in numbers, came eight days after King Mohammed VI in a speech at Morocco’s parliament did not address the Gen Z 212 protests directly. He neither touched on their demands to dismiss Akhannouch nor the stadiums being built for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. He said that national projects and social programs could advance together. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “There should be no contradiction or competition between major national projects and social programs, as both share the same goal: developing the country and improving the living conditions of citizens,” Mohammed VI said in his speech, which many interpreted as an indirect response to protesters who criticized Morocco for prioritizing spending on sports infrastructure over social and economic projects. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Day 2 protests by La Liga players against game in Miami still censored on TV \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Gen Z protests against corruption and inequality are shaking Morocco.

The protests are led by Gen Z 212, a grassroots movement that organizes demonstrations on social media platforms like Discord, an app popular among gamers and teenagers, where they now have more than 200,000 subscribers. It announced protests in more than a dozen cities for Saturday after an eight-day hiatus. Education is a focal point of their demands, specifically policies designed to expand private school enrollment. Since 2000, the number of students enrolled in private universities has increased more than sixfold, according to government data from 2024. State audits have documented teacher shortages, regional disparities and transportation problems, particularly in rural areas where government services have long been lacking. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Measures the government has taken to improve education have not produced the desired impact on improving school quality or student retention, according to government audits. Politicians have pledged to reallocate funds to healthcare and education to accelerate improvements. Finance Minister Nadia Fettah Alaoui said at a World Bank meeting in Washington this week that doing so would be a focus of this year’s government budget. Morocco’s Gen Z-led protests have drawn inspiration from similar movements in nations like Nepal. After eight women died giving birth in a public hospital in Agadir, a coastal city 296 miles (477 kilometers) from the capital Rabat, they set off a wave of fury that then spread nationwide. The protests turned violent in some cities and small towns earlier this month. Police forces killed three who they said were attempting to storm one of their posts as many sustained injuries and authorities reported widespread vandalism. Local media outlets said more 400 people across Morocco were arrested for vandalism linked to protests, some of them held in custody for investigation. And a court in Agadir handed down 17 defendants a total of 162 years for vandalism."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/filipinotown-filipino-american-history-little-manila-4a4e7fb5f34131abe3220f64447ac027","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"04:10:21+00:00","title":"Filipino Towns Gain Recognition Across U.S. Cities Amid Cultural Revival","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Filipino Americans across the United States are actively advocating for formal recognition of 'Filipino Towns' as cultural districts—such as in Las Vegas, Seattle, and Los Angeles—to celebrate their heritage, preserve community identity, and gain public acknowledgment.

the North American continent for the first time. Now, Filipino Americans are working to sustain a cultural footprint. During celebration of October’s  Filipino American History Month , many Filipinos are seeking their cities’ acknowledgment of “Filipino Towns” — a cultural district designation similar to Chinatowns, Japantowns and Koreatowns that highlights the contributions of expat and immigrant populations to a major city’s overall identity. That recognition can be through landmarks, event support or even permanent signage. Three years ago, Los Angeles’ Historic Filipinotown — first designated as a neighborhood in 2002 — constructed a gateway arch, and Little Manila in New York City’s Queens borough debuted an official street sign. Now, Las Vegas has joined the club. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An official “Filipino Town Cultural District” street sign was unveiled last week to great fanfare — six months after Clark County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution affirming the distinction. “That was a great day,” Rozita Lee, the original Filipino Town Las Vegas board president, recalled about the county’s approval. “A great day because we realized that the government actually recognized us Filipinos as a valid, solid entity here in Nevada. We were all so happy.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Making the case for Filipino Towns Lee, 90, has lived in Las Vegas for nearly 50 years. She has seen a 1.2-mile (1.6-kilometer) corridor east of the Strip blossom with Filipino small businesses, a radio station and chains like Seafood City supermarket and Jollibee. Last year, the Filipino Town board’s first step was to gather data to bolster their proposal. Filipinos are the largest Asian group in metro Las Vegas with over 200,000. They also spread the word among business owners. “We visited the people that were in the area because we had to knock on doors and let them know of the possibility of this area being named Filipino Town, and would they support,” Lee said. “Everybody said yes.” Now resigned from the board, Lee is currently planning a Filipino American Museum. Current board president Bernie Benito is looking forward to making Filipino Town a site that tourists will consider. “What we’re going to try to do is just to promote it culturally. We’re going to entice developers, investors to come into the area in order to set up their businesses,” Benito said. Filipino Towns were few compared to other ethnic ‘towns’ Filipino scouts on a Spanish galleon — a heavy, square-rigged sailing ship — landed on Oct. 18, 1587, in Morro Bay, California, likely making them the first known Asian people to reach the U.S. It would be nearly 200 years until Filipinos settled here starting in Louisiana and the West Coast. Pre-World War II, there were some Filipino enclaves made up mostly of single men. They were not as prevalent as Chinatowns and Japantowns. A lot of them either were demolished or floundered as some men moved away, said Joseph Bernardo, an adjunct professor in Asian Pacific American Studies at Loyola Marymount University. U.S. colonial rule over  the Philippines  from 1898 to 1946 led to Filipinos studying English and assimilating to Western culture. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “They have a command of English that doesn’t necessarily tie them to an ethnic economy to survive in the United States,” Bernardo said. “They can get jobs as nurses and accountants and lawyers and doctors, et cetera, with greater ease than other Asian immigrants.” The U.S. Census estimates 4.5 million Filipino people live in the U.S. and less than half are immigrants. Registered nurse is the most common occupation, according to AAPI Data, a research and policy organization. “More Filipino Americans care about cultural pride and want a community space to reflect that,” said Bernardo. Today, there are several Filipino Towns, some more active than others. Stockton, California’s once vibrant Little Manila was torn down by a crosstown freeway in the 1970s. But there are historic walking tours hosted by advocacy group Little Manila Rising. In San Francisco, an artist-driven Filipino Cultural Heritage District known as SOMA Pilipinas includes a community center and public art works. Toronto, Canada, also has an active Little Manila. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Why cultural markers and landmarks matter Over two dozen residents excitedly posed for pictures in May in front of a brand new Seattle Streetcar outfitted in a “Filipinotown”-branded wrap. For them, it was a concrete symbol of their Filipinotown, which the Seattle City Council formally recognized in 2017. Devin Cabanilla, executive director of Filipinotown Seattle, applied to get the special streetcar. “I think having that streetcar has really jump-started us because I mean to some extent the general public doesn’t care. So what if you have some law that says you’re Filipinotown? What are the visible markers of it?” Cabanilla said. “People do want something tangible.” Cabanilla’s great aunt and uncle, Dorothy and Fred Cordova, are credited with creating Filipino American History Month in 1992 through their organization, the Filipino American National Historical Society. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Filipinotown is part of Seattle’s Chinatown-International District. Besides restaurants and shops, Cabanilla hopes visitors stop to appreciate landmarks like the Dr. Jose Rizal Bridge, named after the writer who advocated for Filipino independence. Or Uncle Bob’s Place, an affordable apartment building named for local Filipino American civil rights activist Bob Santos. Future goals for Filipinotown include an official sign, events like poetry sessions and a summer block party. “Our primary vision is to bring back the solidarity that we had when the International District was in its heyday and it was a multicultural place,” Cabanilla said. “I need white people to understand it is not just Chinese, Japanese, East Asian stuff. It has always included Filipinos supporting and living in the district.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-south-carolina-football-score-3cbcf01198e2e6615e419f7d2ae37a79","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:42:04+00:00","title":"Oklahoma Defeats South Carolina 26-7 to Reclaim Momentum in SEC Schedule","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma defeated South Carolina 26-7 in a game that helped them recover from a previous loss to Texas, with quarterback John Mateer throwing for 150 yards and a touchdown and the defense sacking South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers six times.

(AP) — It was a long, disappointing week for Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer, the Washington State transfer who  shouldered much of the blame  for the Sooners’ 23-6 defeat at Texas last week. Mateer and the  14th-ranked  Sooners’ defense made sure to put that loss behind them in a 26-7 win over South Carolina on Saturday. Mateer threw for 150 yards and a touchdown while the defense sacked Gamecocks quarterback LaNorris Sellers six times, had a interception and a safety to get back to their winning ways. “I expected better than that,” Mateer said of his three interception showing against the Longhorns. “Today, whether I was feeling good or not, I was going to play. I got myself to a good point, the team was in a good spot and, yeah, played well.” Oklahoma (6-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) recovered with a steady, mistake-free offense and a best-in-the-nation defense to beat the Gamecocks (3-4, 1-4). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Mateer led touchdown drives of 75 and 92 yards and the Sooners held on fourth-and-goal from their own 5 for a 14-0 lead.

Now it’s your turn to vote with the  AP Top 25 fan poll. \n    \n \n “Whenever anybody questioned our team from a week ago, our guys had the ability to block it out,” Venables said. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Oklahoma came in leading the nation in yards allowed at 193 and kept the pressure up against the Gamecocks. Defensive end Taylor Wein sniffed out a fake punt pass by South Carolina’s Mason Love and got the interception. Five plays later, Mateer found Isaiah Sategna III for a 20-yard TD and a 24-7 lead. Then again, Oklahoma coach Brent Venables knows how to lock down South Carolina at home. He went 4-1 at Williams-Brice Stadium as Clemson’s defensive coordinator, and his group held the Gamecocks to an average of 285 yards and four points in Venables’ last three times in the building. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Sellers, a projected NFL first-round draft pick, finished with 124 yards passing. As a parting shot, Oklahoma defensive tackle Markus Strong tackled tailback Matt Fuller in the end zone for a safety with about four minutes left. Blaylock ran for 101 yards and Oklahoma kicker Tate Sandell matched his career long with a 55-yard field goal. South Carolina struggles The Oklahoma game was a turning point for the Gamecocks a season ago, when a 3-3 team beat the Sooners 35-9 to start a six-game winning streak. This time, it continued a slide South Carolina can’t seem to escape. Things don’t get easier with Alabama, Ole Miss and Texas A&M the next three games. “Right now, I am not getting the most out of this team as the head football coach,” Beamer said. The takeaway Oklahoma: It was a satisfying result for the Sooners, who did not want the Texas loss lingering with the heart of their SEC schedule (Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri and LSU) ahead. South Carolina: Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer hoped that dismissing offensive line coach Lonnie Teasley after losing at LSU last week might fire up his underperforming group. But Oklahoma chased Sellers much of the game and prevented almost any deep passes. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Up next Oklahoma returns home to face No. 5 Ole Miss on Saturday.

Descending from the bus that brought him and other  released Palestinian detainees  to Gaza last week, the 45-year-old medical technician was reunited with his wife and two young children. But when he asked about his mother, his brother wouldn’t look him the eye. Finally they sat him down and told him: His mother, his younger sister Aya, Aya’s children and his aunt and uncle had all been killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit their shelter in central Gaza in July. More than 1,800 Palestinians seized from Gaza by Israeli troops during the  two-year war  were freed this week under the ceasefire deal that brought Hamas’ release of the last living hostages. Israel also freed around 250 Palestinian prisoners convicted over the past decades, who mainly returned to the occupied West Bank or were exiled abroad, though a few were sent to Gaza. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Those released back to Gaza were met by the shock of how their homeland had been destroyed and families shattered by Israeli bombardment and offensives while they were locked away, with little news of the war. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Police looking into whether Prince Andrew enlisted officer to dig up dirt on accuser Giuffre \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 North Korean soldier defects to South Korea across the rivals’ heavily fortified border \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Thieves strike Louvre in daring jewel heist as the world’s most visited museum shuts \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Recounting his return, Abou Moussa said the grief hit even before the freed detainees got off the bus on Monday.

Eight days later, an airstrike hit his family’s home in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, while he was on duty in Nasser Hospital, where he worked as a radiology technician. Video circulating online at the time showed him and his wife, Rawan Salha, rushing around the hospital in search of their son, Youssef, among the casualties. “He’s 7 years old, curly hair, fair-skinned and beautiful,” Salha cried. The boy had been brought in dead. Also killed in the strike were the wife of one of Abu Moussa’s brothers and their two children. In the next months, Abu Moussa worked constantly as wounded flowed into the hospital, where Salha and his two surviving children were also sheltering along with hundreds of others driven from their homes. In February 2024, Israeli forces surrounded the hospital, preparing to storm the facility to search for suspected militants. They demanded everybody leave but staff and patients too critical to move.  But Salha refused to leave without Abu Moussa, he said. So they set out walking with their children. At a nearby Israeli military checkpoint, Abu Moussa was called aside with others for interrogation in a nearby stadium. It was the start of his long separation from his family. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Abuse in prisons Abu Moussa says his months in Israeli prisons were filled with abuse. Like the other detainees released back to Gaza on Monday, he was never charged.  It began in the stadium, where he said he was beaten with sticks and fists during interrogation. All those taken from the checkpoint were kept with their hands bound in zip ties for three days, given no water and not allowed to use a bathroom. “Almost all of us soiled ourselves,” Abu Moussa said. He was taken to  Sde Teiman , a  military prison camp inside Israel , where he would be held two months. Every day, he said, detainees were forced to kneel for hours without moving – “it’s exhausting, you feel your back is broken,” he said. Guards would pull some aside for beatings, said Abu Moussa, adding that his rib was broken in one beating. He was moved to Negev Prison, run by civilian authorities. There, he said, beatings were less frequent, taking place mainly when guards conducted weekly searches of the cells, he said. But conditions were harsh, he said. Nearly all the detainees had scabies, an infestation by mites that dig into the skin. “People were rubbing themselves up against the walls trying to get rid of the itching,” he said. Despite requests, prison officials did not give detainees creams to treat it until a few weeks before his release, he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Bedding was filthy, and detainees were allowed no change of clothes. Cuts often became infected, he said. When they washed their one set of clothing, they had to strip naked and wrap themselves in a blanket – but if guards saw, “they took away the blanket and made you sleep without it,” he said. Sick detainees or those with chronic conditions asked for medicines but were refused, he said. One man, Mohammed al-Astal, suffered a colon blockage that worsened and he eventually died, Abu Moussa said.  “They treated us like animals,” he said. Asked about Abou Moussa’s account, the Israeli Prison Service, which operates Negev Prison, said it was not aware of it. It said it operates in accordance with the law and that prisoners’ rights to medical care and proper living conditions are upheld.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Also in response, the military denied systematic abuse takes place in its facilities and said it acts in accordance with Israeli and international law. It said it investigates any concrete complaints.  Abu Moussa’s account mirrors those of many previously released Palestinians. At least 75 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons and detention facilities during the war, the U.N. said in a report last month, saying conditions in the facilities amounted to torture that contributed to deaths. One  17-year-old Palestinian  who died in prison in March was found to have wasted away from starvation and had colon inflammation and scabies, according to an Israeli doctor who observed the autopsy. Returning to devastation Crossing the border from Israel into Gaza after the release, “the first shock was the destruction,” Abu Moussa said. His home city of Khan Younis was unrecognizable. Entire neighborhoods were razed. He and his fellow passengers searched for landmarks among the shattered buildings. The buses pulled into Nasser Hospital, where the crowd awaited them. Panicked at not seeing them in the crowd, Abu Moussa asked a hospital co-worker where his wife and children were. He assured him they were inside, waiting. He asked one of his brothers about his mother. The brother couldn’t look Abu Moussa in the eye, saying only, “She’s coming.” “He wasn’t being straight with me,” Abu Moussa said. After being reunited with his wife and children, he asked again about his mother and his sister, Aya. Finally, they told him.  Recounting what happened, Abu Moussa fell silent for long moments, overcome with emotion. His voice breaking with tears, he recalled how his mother had always been strong, refusing to cry after one of his brothers was killed during the 2009 Israel-Hamas war.  “She always kept a grip on herself, so we all wouldn’t weaken,” he said.  He wondered if the joy would have broken his mother’s reserve if she’d be able to see him return from his imprisonment. “I miss her. I want to see her,” he cried. “I want to kiss her hand, her head.” ___ Keath reported from Cairo.

Utah drove deep into BYU territory on three different drives in the first three quarters, but the Cougars made fourth-down stops on each drive. BYU: The Cougars roared to life on offense in the fourth quarter to key a late rally, ensuring a move up in the AP Top 25 Poll. Fourth-down Failure Utah passed up kicking field goals on three different occasions. Each time, BYU forced a turnover on downs. Two fourth-down stops came on two of Utah’s first three drives. The Utes drove down to the BYU 12 on their opening drive, covering 82 yards in 11 plays, before Bray got stopped for a 1-yard loss on 4th-and-1. Then Utah reached the BYU 28 on its first drive of the second quarter, only for Dampier to throw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-7. “We want them to be aggressive like that because it is as good as a turnover for us,” Wall said. Running strong Martin put on a show for numerous NFL scouts in attendance — including five from the Las Vegas Raiders — with his fifth 100-yard game this season on a career-high 26 carries. The Big 12’s leading rusher has 774 yards through seven games and has had at least 20 carries in three straight games. “I’m a little bit sore running the football that much, but I wouldn’t want it any other way,” Martin said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Up Next Utah: Hosts Colorado on Saturday.

2025-10-13T14:52:29+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/bosnias-republika-srpska-installs-temporary-president-as-dodik-steps-aside","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:32:06Z","title":"Bosnia’s Republika Srpska installs temporary president as Dodik steps aside","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bosnia’s Republika Srpska has installed Ana Trisic Babic as interim president, following the formal recognition that Milorad Dodik is stepping aside from office after being banned from politics by a Bosnian court.

Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-16","timeOfPublication":"07:27:09+00:00","title":"Climate study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that, despite progress under the Paris Climate Agreement, the Earth will still experience 57 additional superhot days annually by 2100 — nearly two months of dangerous heat.

Climate study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year\n\nA new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-says-us-will-repatriate-survivors-of-submarine-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"21:44:31+00:00","title":"Trump says US will repatriate survivors of ‘submarine’ attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that two survivors from a US-military-targeted semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, alleged to be carrying fentanyl and other narcotics, will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia.

destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday.\n\nHe said that US intelligence has confirmed the vessel was carrying fentanyl and other narcotics.\n\nThe vessel was targeted on Thursday in what Trump described as a strike aimed at disrupting a major drug trafficking route.\n\nTwo crew members were killed, he said, while two others  survived  and were airlifted by US forces in a helicopter rescue operation to a nearby US Navy warship.\n\nThe US military held the survivors on board at least until Friday evening.\n\nThe press office for Ecuador’s government said it was not aware of the plans for repatriation. There was no immediate comment from Colombian authorities.\n\nAt least six vessels, most of them speedboats, have been targeted by US strikes in the Caribbean since September, with Venezuela alleged to be the origin of some of them.\n\nWashington says its campaign is dealing a decisive blow to drug trafficking, but it has provided no evidence that the people killed were drug smugglers.\n\nWith Trump’s confirmation of the death toll on his Truth Social platform, that means US military actions against vessels in the region have killed at least 29 people.\n\nThe president has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. He is relying on the same legal authority used by the administration of former President George W Bush when it declared a war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the US. This includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and use lethal force to take out their leadership. Trump is also treating the suspected traffickers as if they were enemy soldiers in a traditional war.\n\nPrevious similar strikes have raised concerns from Democratic lawmakers and legal experts who argue that such operations may exceed accepted wartime authority and risk violating international law.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the latest targeted vessel had been “built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs”.\n\nThe mission comes amid a sharp US  military buildup  across the Caribbean, involving guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear-powered submarine and about 6,500 troops. The escalation has fuelled accusations that Washington is inching towards direct confrontation with Venezuela.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump confirmed that he had  authorised the CIA  to carry out covert operations inside Venezuela, intensifying fears in Caracas that the US is attempting to topple President  Nicolas Maduro .\n\nMaduro has repeatedly denied involvement in drug trafficking and accused Washington of fabricating a narco-terrorism narrative as a pretext for trying to change the government.

You pollute, you pay,” he added.\n\nTalia also said that it was frustrating to see his own country struggling to survive, while other countries continue to spend billions of dollars on weapons for current and future wars.\n\n“Whilst your country is facing this existential threat, it’s quite disappointing to see that the world is investing billions and trillions of dollars in wars, in conflicts,” he said.\n\nA report released this week by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) found that 39 small island countries, which are home to some 65 million people, already need about $12bn a year to help them cope with the effects of climate change.\n\nThat figure is many times more than the roughly $2bn a year they are collectively receiving now, and which represents just 0.2 percent of the amount spent on global climate finance worldwide.\n\nGCA, a Rotterdam-based nonprofit organisation, also found that island states are already experiencing an average $1.7bn in annual economic losses due to climate change.\n\nTuvalu is not only focused on its own survival – the island state is considered to be facing one of the most severe existential threats from rising sea levels – it is also continuing to find ways to fight climate change globally.\n\n“That’s why Tuvalu is leading the  Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty ,” Talia said.\n\nAbout 16 countries have now signed on to the treaty, with Colombia offering to host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels next year.\n\n“We see its relevance for us,” Talia said of the treaty.\n\n“We want to grow in number in order for us to come up with a treaty, apart from the  Paris Agreement ,” he said.\n\nEven as Tuvalu, a country with a population of less than 10,000 people, is fighting for immediate action on climate change, it is also making preparations for its own uncertain future, including creating a digital repository of its culture so that nothing is lost to the sea.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu’s minister for culture, said that he made the formal preliminary submission to UNESCO two weeks before the UNGA meeting for “the whole of Tuvalu to be listed” on the World Heritage List.\n\n“If we are to disappear, which is something that we don’t want to anticipate, but if worst comes to worst, at least you know our values, our culture, heritage, are well secured,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLikewise, Talia said his country doesn’t see its 2023 cooperation pact with Australia, which also includes the world’s first climate change migration visa, as an indication that the island’s future is sealed.\n\n“I don’t look at the Falepili Agreement as a way of escaping the issue of climate change, but rather a pathway,” he said.\n\n“A pathway that we will allow our people in Tuvalu to get good education, trained, and then return home,” he said, referring to the agreement giving some Tuvaluans access to education, healthcare and unlimited travel to Australia.\n\nThe agreement text includes an acknowledgement from both parties that “the statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu will continue, and the rights and duties inherent thereto will be maintained, notwithstanding the impact of climate change-related sea level rise”.\n\nTalia also said that a  recent ruling from the UN’s top court , the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, declared that states have a responsibility to address climate change by cooperating to cut emissions, following through on climate agreements, and protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from harm.\n\nThe ICJ ruling “really changed the whole context of climate change debates”, Talia said.\n\n“The highest court has spoken, the highest court has delivered the judgement,” he said of the case, which was brought before the ICJ by Tuvalu’s neighbour Vanuatu.\n\n“So it’s just a matter of, how are we going to live that, or weave that, into our climate policies,” he said.\n\n“We need to hold the industrialised countries accountable to their actions,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/afghanistan-pakistan-agree-to-immediate-ceasefire-after-talks-in-doha","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"02:35:27+00:00","title":"Afghanistan, Pakistan agree to immediate ceasefire after talks in Doha","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following high-level talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, after a week of deadly cross-border clashes.

more deceased Israeli captives  from Gaza, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced, as the Palestinian group accused Israel of continuing to commit ceasefire violations.\n\n“Israel has received, via the Red Cross, the bodies of two hostages”, which were returned to Israeli security forces in Gaza, Netanyahu’s office said in a post on the X social media platform early on Sunday.\n\nThe prime minister’s office said the families of Israeli captives were updated on the return of the remains, and the two bodies had been transferred to Israel’s National Centre of Forensic Medicine for identification.\n\n“The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned,” the prime minister’s office added.\n\nThe Israeli military reported later that one of the bodies was confirmed to be that of Ronen Tomi Engel. The 54-year-old was killed during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza.\n\nIdentification tests are continuing on the second set of remains, the military said.\n\nWith the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has now returned the remains of 12 of the 28 bodies of captives being held in Gaza, a key demand by Israel in the week-old ceasefire deal to end the two-year war.\n\nAccording to the deal, Hamas was to return all of the Israeli captives – both the living and dead – within 72 hours of its signing. In exchange, Israel was to release 360 bodies of deceased Palestinians and some 2,000 prisoners.\n\nHamas has said the widespread devastation in the Palestinian territory and the Israeli military’s continuing control of certain parts of Gaza have slowed the recovery of the bodies.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinian authorities do not have adequate equipment to help with the search for captives’ bodies beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\n“It’s very difficult, with recovery teams on the ground facing extraordinary challenges. [They have] no bulldozers, no trucks, no cranes and no heavy equipment… to speed up the process and help with the recovery and return of bodies,” Mahmoud said.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, who is reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel and the occupied West Bank, said that Netanyahu’s government has known “for some time” that the  recovery of captives’ bodies  would be “an incredibly difficult and daunting task”.\n\nNetanyahu, however, has accused Hamas of not doing enough to return the remains of all 28, saying that all of the bodies need to be returned immediately, Salhut said.\n\n“Until that happens, that’s when Israel is going to honour more of the commitments of the ceasefire, like letting in more humanitarian assistance, talking about opening the Rafah border crossing,” she said.\n\nFor days, Hamas and Israel have traded blame over violations of the US-mediated ceasefire.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas accused the Netanyahu government of “fabricating flimsy pretexts” to not follow through on its commitments to the peace deal, as well as denouncing Israel’s refusal to open the Rafah crossing with Egypt as “a blatant violation” of the agreement.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli forces  killed 11 members  of a single family, including seven children, in an attack east of Gaza City.\n\nThe Palestinian Embassy in Egypt announced earlier on Saturday that the  Rafah crossing , the main gateway for people in Gaza to leave and enter the enclave, would reopen on Monday.\n\nBut Netanyahu said the border crossing would remain closed until Hamas hands over the bodies of all the deceased captives.\n\nThe delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza also remains slow despite the ceasefire deal.\n\nOn Saturday, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it had enough humanitarian food supplies to feed Gaza for three months, but trucks carrying the life-saving cargo are unable to enter Gaza and are stuck in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt.\n\n“We must be allowed to get all this aid into Gaza without delay,” UNRWA said, adding that it also has equipment to provide shelter to as many as 1.3 million people."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-evacuate-philippine-coast-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-approaches","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:05:43+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuate Philippine coast as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches, thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes have evacuated their homes to avoid coastal flooding and strong winds.

of daily screenings of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (The Bravehearted Will Take the Bride), which shot actors Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol to superstardom.\n\nThe film, widely known to fans as DDLJ, redefined modern Hindi romance and continues to draw hundreds of cinemagoers to its morning screenings with its tale of young lovers bucking tradition since its release on October 20, 1995.\n\n“I have seen it about 30 times … and I will continue watching it,” Mohammad Shakir, 60, told the AFP news agency as he bought a ticket for 40 rupees ($0.45).\n\nManoj Desai, the head of the cinema located near Bombay Central Station, told AFP that weekday crowds tend to be made up of university students and young couples.\n\n“On Sundays, you will find around 500 people, even after 30 years,” said Desai.\n\nThe film, which far outstrips the five-year run of the 1975 action-thriller Sholay (Embers) at another Mumbai theatre, revolves around the contrast between the more liberal values of second-generation Indians overseas and the conservative values of their parents.\n\nDesai said it was common for audiences to break into cheers and applause during the film’s climax, when the heroine runs alongside a moving train into her lover’s arms.\n\n“This is the goosebump moment,” Desai said. “The father letting his daughter go, saying she won’t find a better partner to spend her life with.”\n\nIt is a message that continues to resonate with younger viewers, even those who were not born when it was released.\n\n“In our generation today, we often see transactional relationships,” Omkar Saraf, 23, told AFP. “But in this film, the hero crosses all boundaries to win his love with no expectations.\n\n“We have watched it on television, on our mobiles, but the big screen gives us goosebumps.”\n\nDesai said one die-hard fan of the movie had been coming to screenings for 20 years, while for others, the film had played a part in their own love stories.\n\nOne couple watched it while dating, before inviting Desai to their wedding. “They went abroad for their honeymoon – and came back to watch the movie,” Desai said.\n\nThe film’s daily screenings were almost discontinued in 2015, but backlash from fans meant the decision was reversed, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\n\nFilm critic Baradwaj Rangan said the film had enduring appeal in a country still navigating the tensions between traditional and modern values.\n\n“It represents a certain point in Indian culture, and that is why it is still loved,” Rangan said, adding that it “perfectly captured” the friction between two generations.\n\n“The film has become a kind of cultural monument,” he said. “I think it is going to be playing forever.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/in-iraq-will-muqtada-al-sadrs-endgame-of-power-work","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:42:41+00:00","title":"Iraq’s

undermine the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF) by boycotting elections and leveraging public mobilization, aiming to form a 'national majority' government on his terms. After withdrawing his bloc from parliament in 2022, he initially engaged in back-channel negotiations with the government, only to withdraw again after the SCF rejected a registration extension. His movement, rebranded as the Patriotic Shia Current, has sought alliances with Sunni and Kurdish parties, including Mohammed al-Halbousi and the KDP, to build a coalition outside SCF control. Despite winning 73 seats in 2021, the government formation effort failed when the Federal Supreme Court raised the quorum threshold, enabling the SCF to form an 'obstructing third'. Al-Sadr has since used street protests and public outreach—particularly during Ashura—to maintain visibility and political momentum. Meanwhile, the SCF has strengthened its dominance, removing key Sadrist officials and facing accusations of judicial politicization. As Iraq faces deepening economic crisis, U.S. sanctions, and Israeli threats, al-Sadr's strategy of strategic withdrawal and public pressure positions him as a potential power broker in the event of political collapse.","keyTakeAways":["Muqtada al-Sadr’s boycott of the 2022 elections was not a total withdrawal from politics but a strategic postponement of his goal to form a government on his own

power\n\nIn a statement last month, Iraqi Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr said his movement would boycott the November elections, hinting he wants to “change the faces and save Iraq” – reportedly his endgame since he withdrew his bloc from parliament in June 2022.\n\nHe also took aim at political rivals, the Shia Coordination Framework (SCF), a coalition of Iran-backed parties that became the largest Shia bloc in parliament after he withdrew, accusing them of rocket attacks against his allies.\n\nAl-Sadr’s statement spoke of demanding no less than total system reform, but did not mention that the Sadrists had in fact held private back-channel negotiations with the establishment to try to re-enter the electoral race, which ultimately failed.\n\nAl-Sadr’s withdrawal cannot be seen as a total boycott of politics; it is rather a postponement of his ultimate goal of forming a government on his terms.\n\nHe seems to be playing a long game, waiting for the state to collapse under his rivals’ governance while positioning the Sadrists as the most organised, unaffiliated power ready to step in.\n\nAccording to a source close to al-Sadr, speaking on condition of anonymity, the leader had agreed to pressure from key Sadrists who wanted to participate in the election, arguing it would protect remaining Sadrist officials facing pressure in state institutions.\n\nDespite initial reluctance, al-Sadr eventually agreed: The Sadrists would temporarily suspend their three-year boycott, with the understanding that al-Sadr could withdraw again if he chose.\n\nBut they would need an extension to the official registration period, which had elapsed, and the source said al-Sadr approved opening channels with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who was appointed by the SCF, the biggest parliamentary bloc, to ask for an extension.\n\nThe SCF refused, reluctant to see the Sadrists return and compete with its members, especially smaller groups running on their own this year.\n\nBut Sadrist politicians kept negotiating for a deadline extension until Al-Sadr undercut his negotiators in July, posting a handwritten note with the hashtag #Boycotters, ending the talks.\n\nAl-Sadr boycotted the political process in 2022 after his plan to form a “national majority” government failed in the face of Iraq’s power-sharing agreement, Muhasasa, in place since 2006.\n\nMuhasasa distributes cabinet positions and state resources along ethno-sectarian lines, with all parties in parliament forming the government and receiving executive posts equal to their representation.\n\nProponents say Muhasasa prevents the return of a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein’s, while critics say it diffuses accountability and is a primary cause of government failure.\n\nIn contrast, a “national majority” government is formed by blocs that secure a parliamentary majority of more than 50 percent, forcing other blocs into the opposition with no executive positions.\n\nSadrists were laying the groundwork for a parliamentary alliance months before the October 2021 election.\n\nThe outreach began in April with a first-ever phone call between Al-Sadr and a major Sunni leader, Mohammed al-Halbousi. In June, a high-level Sadrist delegation made an unprecedented visit to Erbil to meet with Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) for similar talks.\n\n“The agreement was simple: Each party would manage its own region without interference, we would form a government without the other parties, who would be free to form an opposition,” explained a Sadrist source privy to the talks with al-Halbousi and KDP.\n\nWinning 73 out of 329 seats in the election, the Sadrists formed a coalition with the KDP (31 seats), Al-Halbousi’s Taqadum Movement (37 seats), Sunni leader Khamis al-Khanjar and independent MPs to form a 175-seat coalition named Inqath Watan (Saving a Homeland).\n\nBut then-President Barham Salih asked the Federal Supreme Court for an interpretation that ended Inqath Watan’s plan.\n\nThe court mandated a two-thirds quorum to elect a new president, who would then name the next prime minister, raising the government-formation threshold from 165 to 220 MPs, allowing the SCF to form an “obstructing third”.\n\nThe Sadrists have been in every Iraqi government since 2006, fluctuating between 30 and 70 seats, under names including Ahrar Bloc, Sairoon Alliance, and, in 2021, the Sadrist Bloc.\n\nTheir influence peaked with the 73 seats they got in the 2021 election, which were allocated to runners-up in their districts, who were mostly SCF, after the bloc withdrew from parliament in June 2022.\n\nWith the parliamentary majority in hand, the SCF nominated al-Sudani as prime minister in July.\n\nAl-Sadr, angered by a government formation controlled by his rivals, decided to leverage street power to demand the dissolution of parliament and new elections.\n\nHis followers breached the outer checkpoints of Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government headquarters, parliament, and foreign embassies and began an initially peaceful sit-in in the parliament.\n\nHowever, the sit-in escalated as protesters moved towards the nearby headquarters of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a state-sponsored umbrella of mostly pro-Iranian armed factions, many of which form the core of the SCF.\n\nThe resulting armed clashes ended only when al-Sadr gave a televised speech ordering his supporters to withdraw to prevent further bloodshed.\n\nThe SCF-led parliament elected Abdul Latif Rashid, from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the main political rivals to Sadr ally KDP, as the new president of Iraq.\n\nAl-Sudani was tasked with forming a cabinet and quickly won a vote of confidence from parliament.\n\nThe SCF consolidated its grip, removing key Sadrist officials, including the Central Bank governor and the governors of Amarah and Najaf, and pursuing vendettas against al-Sadr’s allies, even allegedly through Iraq’s judiciary, which experts have accused of being politicised.\n\nAs Inqath Watan worked to form a government, the Federal Court annulled the Kurdistan regional government’s 2007 oil and gas law and all energy contracts signed under it. The lawsuit had stalled since the oil ministry filed it in 2019.\n\nIn November 2023, the Federal Court expelled Mohammed al-Halbousi from parliament, ending his speakership after the tripartite alliance re-elected him in January 2022.\n\nYet other aspects of its governing have not been successful, with an internal economic crisis looming and external pressure building.\n\nThe Iraqi government faces an exorbitant domestic spending bill, with public sector salaries, social welfare and pensions adding up to 44.9 trillion Iraqi dinars in the first half of 2025, 99.2 percent of all oil revenues – Iraq’s main source of income – during the same period.\n\nExternally, the government faces Israeli threats and claims that it hosts Iranian militias, as well as a cascade of US sanctions targeting private Iraqi banks and individuals, accusing them of supporting Iran.\n\nIn the meantime, al-Sadr has worked to shore up his support among Iraqi Shia, building on his membership of one of the most respected Shia families. He also rebranded his group as the Patriotic Shia Current in April 2024.\n\nHis pressure on the SCF within their shared Shia constituency has seen him mobilising on issues the SCF could not disagree on without damaging their own religious credentials.\n\nHe also made a foray into Baghdad’s Tahrir Square and Nasiriyah’s Haboubi Square, important sites for the 2019 Tishreen protest movement, which al-Sadr was accused of trying to take over and subsequently abandoning to face government security forces alone.\n\nDuring 2025 Ashura, al-Sadr set up tents with food and refreshments for pilgrims in the two squares, something no political faction had dared do for fear of backlash from anti-government protesters.\n\nRegionally, he has positioned himself to avoid entanglement and build a profile distinct from the threatening rhetoric of his SCF rivals.\n\nHe endorsed the regime change in Syria and limited his response to the war in Gaza to condemnations and statements, positioning himself as a viable, predictable future partner in the eyes of Western powers like the United States and regional actors like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar.\n\nWhether Iraq will enter paralysis triggered by US sanctions, Israeli attacks, or economic crisis remains to be seen.\n\nIf it does, al-Sadr and his Patriotic Shia Current may be well positioned to step in and fill the vacuum."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1333","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"00:33:16+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,333","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, Russia claims to have captured the village of Pleshchiivka in Donetsk, while Ukraine reports no immediate response.

to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and

spending but envisions peace with neighbouring China, whose sovereignty claims over the island have long roiled ties.\n\nMembers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, which traditionally has had warm ties with Beijing, voted to elect former lawmaker Cheng Li-wun as chairperson on Saturday.\n\nCheng, 55, who defeated former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and four others, will take over the party leadership on November 1.\n\nThe election of Cheng, who warns against letting Taiwan “become the sacrifice of geopolitics”, has deep implications for domestic politics at a time of heightened  military and political tensions with China .\n\nWhile the KMT does not control the presidency, the party and its ally – the small Taiwan People’s Party – together hold enough seats to form a majority bloc in the legislature, creating a headache for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) trying to get the budget and its legislation passed.\n\nSpeaking at party headquarters in Taipei, Cheng said the KMT under her leadership would be a “creator of regional peace”.\n\n“The KMT will make our home the strongest shelter for everyone against life’s storms. Because we will safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait,” she said. “We must not let Taiwan become a troublemaker.”\n\nCheng, who started out in politics in the DPP, said during the campaign that she did not support  increasing the defence budget , a key policy of President William Lai Ching-te’s administration that also has  strong backing  from the United States.\n\nCheng beat the establishment candidate Hau, 73, with more than 50 percent of the vote, though turnout was less than 40 percent of the party members.\n\nBut accusations of Chinese interference in the election from a key supporter of Hau’s, the KMT’s vice presidential candidate last year, Jaw Shau-kong, overshadowed the campaign. Jaw said social media accounts had spread disinformation about Hau.\n\nThe head of Taiwan’s National Security Bureau, Tsai Ming-yen, said it found more than 1,000 videos discussing the election on TikTok, in addition to 23 YouTube accounts posting related content, with over half of the YouTube accounts based outside of Taiwan. He did not say which candidates these videos supported or directly answer whether they were based in China.\n\nDPP spokesperson Wu Cheng claimed that Chinese interference was obvious and the KMT should carefully guard against it, saying his party hoped that the new chair would prioritise Taiwan’s safety over party interests.\n\nCheng rejected the allegations of China influencing her party as “very cheap labels”.\n\nBeijing, for its part, said the election was a KMT matter and that some online comments from mainland China internet users did not represent an official stance."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/us-claims-gaza-ceasefire-in-jeopardy-as-hamas-plans-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"06:27:04+00:00","title":"Hamas rejects US claim on Gaza ceasefire violation as ‘Israeli propaganda’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas has rejected U.S. claims that it is planning a civilian attack in Gaza, calling the allegations 'Israeli propaganda' and accusing the U.S. of enabling Israel's occupation.

propaganda and provide cover for the continuation of the occupation’s crimes and organised aggression” against the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe US State Department had claimed that Hamas is planning an attack against  civilians in Gaza  “in grave violation of the ceasefire” and called on the mediating nations to demand that the group uphold its obligations under the US-backed peace deal.\n\nIn a

this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said, without giving specific details on the planned attack.\n\nThe United States has

misleading narrative and to focus on curbing its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement”.\n\n“The facts on the ground reveal the exact opposite, as the occupation authorities are the ones who formed, armed, and funded criminal gangs that carried out killings, kidnappings, theft of aid trucks, and assaults against Palestinian civilians. They have openly admitted their crimes through media and video clips, confirming the occupation’s involvement in spreading chaos and disrupting security,” it said.\n\nHamas said its police forces in Gaza, “with broad popular and community support, are fulfilling their national duty in pursuing these gangs and holding them accountable according to clear legal mechanisms, to protect citizens and preserve public and private property”.\n\nPalestine scholar and Middle East analyst Mouin Rabbani described the US State Department warning as mind-boggling.\n\n“I think this is really an attempt to stoke civil conflict within the Gaza Strip … to achieve what so far Israel has failed to achieve,” Rabbani said.\n\nThe Dutch-Palestinian analyst pointed out that Israel has already attempted to “wreak havoc” in Gaza by joining forces with “armed gangs and collaborator militias” who act as Israeli proxies in the war-torn enclave.\n\n“To suggest that this is in any way the United States coming to the defence of those whose genocide it has unconditionally supported for two entire years just boggles the mind and defies the imagination,” Rabbani said.\n\nHamas and Israel have been trading blame over violations of the US-mediated ceasefire since it came into force last week,  threatening the success of the week-old deal .\n\nGershon Baskin, an American-Israeli analyst, told Al Jazeera that throughout the history of agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, all of them have been “breached” one way or another.\n\n“If the Americans are serious that they want this to work, they have to be engaged every single day and several times a day” to make sure the steps agreed on are carried out on the ground, he said.\n\nThe Gaza Government Media Office said on Saturday that it had counted almost 50 Israeli violations of the peace deal, resulting in 38 Palestinian deaths and 143 injuries since the ceasefire took hold.\n\nIt called Israel’s actions “flagrant and clear violations of the ceasefire decision and the rules of international humanitarian law”.\n\nAccording to the office, Israeli forces in Gaza fired directly at and bombed civilians, attacks that reflected Israel’s “continued aggressive approach despite the declaration of a ceasefire”.\n\nIsrael has also been accused of failing to comply with the ceasefire deal by continuing to block efforts to reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nThe opening of Rafah has been called for in order to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Strip and to allow Palestinians to travel abroad.\n\nAmid growing frustration with Israel’s refusal to open the Rafah crossing, Rawhi Fattouh, the president of the Palestinian National Council – the Palestine Liberation Organization’s legislative body – urged the international community on Saturday to deploy international forces in Gaza to protect Palestinians and ensure the ceasefire deal is implemented."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/19/live-israel-continues-deadly-attacks-on-gaza-closes-rafah-crossing?update=4044590","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:36:20+00:00","title":"Israel continues deadly attacks on Gaza, closes Rafah crossing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Israel continues conducting deadly attacks in Gaza, with at least 38 Palestinians killed and 47 violations of a ceasefire agreement.

2025-10-06T14:46:58+00:00\n\nTitle: AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?\n\nSeveral wealthy Italian businessmen received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/19/live-israel-continues-deadly-attacks-on-gaza-closes-rafah-crossing?update=4044685","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:36:20+00:00","title":"Israel continues deadly attacks on Gaza, closes Rafah crossing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Israel has continued deadly military attacks on Gaza, resulting in at least 38 Palestinian deaths and 47 violations of a ceasefire agreement.

government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks.

2025-10-15T13:18:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has announced new and expanded export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium), effective from December 1, 2025.

Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/mexico-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-64-with-dozens-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"21:47:55+00:00","title":"Mexico flooding death toll rises to 64, with dozens still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond caused severe flooding and landslides across five Mexican states—Veracruz, Hidalgo, Puebla, and Queretaro—resulting in at least 64 deaths and 65 people still missing.

awards announced?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes 2025 have officially kicked off with the first award for physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqnjpvr79o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"14:14:35.300+00:00","title":"Sir David Attenborough is oldest Daytime Emmy winner for Secret Lives of Orangutans","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sir David Attenborough, at 99 years old, has become the oldest Daytime Emmy winner in history, winning in the outstanding daytime personality category for his documentary 'Secret Lives of Orangutans,' which also earned awards for music direction and directing.

2025-10-18T23:34:33.570+00:00\n\nTitle: Mystery lingers weeks after schoolgirl found dead in D4vd's Tesla\n\nThe day after a body was found in his car in Hollywood, singer D4vd was belting his TikTok hit Romantic Homicide - a brooding breakup song about killing an ex with no regret - to a sold-out crowd in Minneapolis.\n\nThe US recording artist had self-launched his music career from his sister's closet while working a part-time gig at Starbucks. It led him to viral fame, millions of followers online, and a global tour.\n\nBut all of it came to an abrupt halt last month with the discovery of a severely decomposed body in the front trunk of his Tesla.\n\nThe corpse was identified as that of 15-year-old runaway Celeste Rivas Hernandez.\n\nA month later, mystery still surrounds the teen's death, as well as her relationship to the 20-year-old singer, whose legal name is David Anthony Burke.\n\nDeep dives into his macabre oeuvre - which is peppered with references to death, remembrance, violence and bloody motifs - have led some to question if life was imitating art and vice versa.\n\nThe young singer has yet to publicly comment on the case or the grim discovery in his car. His spokesperson has only said that that he is \"fully cooperating with authorities\" and he has since hired a prominent criminal defence attorney who has represented celebrities such as Mel Gibson, Lindsay Lohan, Kanye West and Britney Spears.\n\nRepresentatives for the singer - including his lawyer Blair Berk, Universal Music Group, Darkroom Records and Sony Music Publishing - did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.\n\nRivas Hernandez's cause of death has yet to be determined.\n\nThe county's medical examiner has said her body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found and has deferred making a ruling on how she died - an investigation they say could take months.\n\nPolice have also not named a suspect or person of interest in case, even weeks after discovering her body.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has not offered many details in the case or the probe, calling it an open death investigation. The department would not comment on multiple questions posed by the BBC about the case, the investigation and any connections the singer may have to Rivas Hernandez.\n\n\"It's just such a strange one,\" Neama Rahmani, a former prosecutor and Los Angeles attorney, told the BBC. \"It keeps getting more bizarre each day that goes on without an arrest.\"\n\nThat lack of information has also seemed to fuel intrigue. Fans, true-crime enthusiasts and internet sleuths have launched their own inquiries, locking in on details that appear to connect the teen girl with the gamer-turned-songwriter, who was once heralded by GQ as a \"Mouthpiece for Gen-Z Heartache\".\n\nRivas Hernandez - who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had last been reported missing by her family in April 2024, but it was not the first time she had run away from their Lake Elsinore home.\n\nA first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, neighbours recognised her as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda,  according to the Los Angeles Times .\n\nShe first went missing on Valentine's Day 2024, and her family filed a missing persons report the next day.\n\nPosters of her face were put up in her neighbourhood and her mother posted pleas on Facebook in Spanish for her return - public overtures that apparently irked the teen.\n\nOver the next two years, her parents would file at least two more missing-persons reports.\n\nHer family and friends told the newspaper that every time Rivas Hernandez ran away, she would eventually return and blend back into her life as a middle schooler.\n\nWhen the teens' remains were found in a bag in D4vd's Tesla on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.\n\nShe also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.\n\nThe decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.\n\nHer family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, has said they are \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They have since solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place earlier this month.\n\nD4vd's rise to stardom - fuelled by TikTok and online gaming - is a paradigm for his generation.\n\nGrowing up near Houston, Texas, he was home-schooled and said he exclusively listened to gospel music until he was 13. He became an avid Fortnite player in 2017 and launched his music career using pop songs to soundtrack gameplay montages that he posted on YouTube.\n\nHe started making his own music when he ran into copyright hurdles, beginning by recording songs on The BandLab app in 2021 and uploading his work on SoundCloud.\n\nSoon, he saw his music breaking through with thousands of listens. He then released what would become his two biggest hits thus far: Romantic Homicide and Here With Me.\n\nThe songs went viral on TikTok and led to billions of streams on Spotify, where he has amassed 33 million monthly listeners.\n\nHe signed with Darkroom and Interscope Records and released his debut EP, Petals and Thorns, in 2023. That same year, he landed on Variety's Young Hollywood list and opened for SZA on her SOS tour.\n\nLast spring, he made his Coachella debut - known as the festival for up-and-coming talent to break into mainstream fame. He was also commissioned by Fortnite - which he has said shaped his story as an artist - to create the game's first official anthem, Locked & Loaded.\n\nBut this ascent to fame came to a pause when his Tesla was towed to an impoundment lot and  authorities found a bag inside the front trunk  that contained Rivas Hernandez's decomposing remains after someone complained about a foul smell.\n\nHis world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his sophomore album.\n\nLos Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.\n\nUS retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.\n\nBut while his career ground to a screeching halt,   authorities have been silent on the investigation into Rivas Hernandez's death.\n\nInvestigators have not released any new information in the case since 29 September.\n\nThe agency also said that it is  still unclear whether there is any criminal culpability beyond the concealment of her body .\n\nWhile online sleuths have been quick to speculate, legal experts say that there is still much we don't know.\n\n\"You have this connection to David that seems pretty strong,\" Mr Rahmani, the former prosecutor, told the BBC. \"There is a lot of smoke but look, he could be absolutely innocent and it could be someone else who had access to his vehicle.\"\n\nMr Rahmani said while there are many questions in this case, the biggest for him is \"what is taking the LAPD so long\".\n\n\"They haven't released any real information,\" he said. \"This isn't a good look for the LAPD and it's a terrible look for D4vd.\"\n\nHe added that a case like this has added pressures: it involves a teen girl's death, it has garnered global headlines, and the investigation involves a celebrity.\n\nMr Rahmani noted that technology and potential for video footage is likely to be a \"treasure trove\" for investigators. Telsa vehicles come with advanced technology that tracks vehicles, notifies users when things like the trunk is open and are also outfitted with a slew of cameras as part of its Sentry Mode systems.\n\nOn top of this, the Hollywood home where he was living also had cameras. When authorities searched the home last month, investigators took a DVR that stores video and other data from the surveillance system.\n\nMalden Trifunovic, the owner of the Hollywood Hills home D4vd was renting, has told the BBC that he has hired a private investigator to help uncover what might have happened inside his multi-million-dollar abode.\n\nD4vd's manager Josh Marshall, the founder of Mogul Vision, rented the home for D4vd and has distanced himself from the singer. He vehemently denied rumours that he is connected to the death investigation.\n\nIn addition to the mystery surrounding the cause of Rivas Hernandez's death, it is still unclear what relationship the teenager had with the 20-year-old singer.\n\nRivas Hernandez would have turned 15 the day before her body was found by police.\n\nIn California, the age of consent is 18.\n\nFamily, friends and those who knew her have told local media that she had been dating someone named David and said he was a music artist.\n\nA former middle-school science teacher blamed her last attempt to run away from home, in the spring of 2024, on her dating a music artist she'd met online.\n\n\"She's been missing since I taught her,\" the teacher said in a viral video after Rivas Hernandez's body was identified.\n\nOnline sleuths have also connected her to the singer in a number of ways, from their matching tattoos to photos he posted online that appear to show them together.\n\nBut D4vd has not addressed the rumours, nor have police.\n\nLike many who don't follow indie pop music, his landlord Mr Trifunovic said he had never heard of D4vd until news broke about the discovery. He didn't even know it was D4vd who was renting his home because the lease had been signed by the singer's manager, Mr Marshall.\n\n\"I share the same anxiety and desire to understand what happened to poor Celeste as everyone else does,\" Mr Trifunovic told the BBC.\n\nAlthough he said he trusts the LAPD to conduct a thorough investigation, he too, is anxious for information.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question that a crime was committed,\" he said.\n\n\"She did not place herself in the front trunk of the Tesla or move the vehicle to where it was found.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15p9ndxd4eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"23:47:59.938Z","title":"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki - why I fell in love with this book","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the global impact of Baek Se-hee's memoir 'I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki,' a deeply personal book that explores her struggles with dysthymia and anxiety through candid conversations with a psychiatrist.

It's soul food.\n\nThis sweet and spicy dish made with chewy rice cakes is a staple of Korea's street food culture and beloved by people of all ages.\n\nIt's the food students turn to after long school days, and as adults, one you seek after a hard day at work.\n\nSo when readers came across a book titled I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki in 2018, many were immediately intrigued. Its honest yet playful title sparked curiosity, some wondering just how much you must love tteokbokki to write an entire book about it. Many were soon drawn to its raw honesty.\n\nIt became an instant bestseller that was widely discussed and resonated deeply in Korea. This week,  Baek Se-hee, the book's South Korean author, died aged 35 . The details surrounding her death remain unclear. The fact the Korean Organ Donation Agency said Baek had saved five lives by donating her organs, emphasised her wish to help others.\n\nHer death at such a young age has brought deep sorrow to readers who found comfort and understanding in her words. Social media and blogs have been flooded with tributes and personal stories from those her books have helped, while news outlets around the world reported her passing prominently.\n\nAt its heart, the book is a record of Baek's conversations with her psychiatrist as she navigates dysthymia - a mild but long-lasting type of depression - and anxiety disorders. Through these sessions, she opens up about her daily struggles - such as overthinking others' opinions, obsessing over her appearance, and wrestling with self-doubt. Rather than examining clinical depression, she reflects on the gentle melancholy many can relate to.\n\nWhat makes her story so compelling is its candour. She captures that delicate human contradiction of living wearily with everyday sadness alongside the simultaneous desire to keep going. Just like a comforting dish of tteokbokki on a difficult day, her words offer warmth and understanding, reminding readers that even in vulnerability there is strength.\n\nOne of the many young people the book resonated with is Jo Eun Bit, a 25-year-old student at Korea University in Seoul, who found it helped her navigate uncertainty about her future.\n\n\"All generations in Korea tend to measure themselves against what others are doing and the achievements they've made, and that only fuels competition,\" she said. \"But I liked this book because it seems to send the message that it's OK not to live according to the standards set by society.\n\n\"One of the most memorable passages in her book is that I am a one-of-a-kind being in this world, and that alone makes me special. I am someone I should care for throughout my life. The more I look within myself, the happier I believe I will become.\n\n\"To me, this offered comfort that it's OK not to be perfect, and at the same time reminded me that I, too, am someone who needs to be nurtured and cared for.\"\n\nThe relentless competition from school to the workplace, coupled with the pressure to meet family and societal expectations, is leaving many young South Koreans feeling disheartened. In a society still influenced by Confucian values such as righteousness and obedience, mental health issues remain heavily stigmatised and many experience feelings of shame or social judgement.\n\nBaek's book inverted the notion that social success is the ultimate measure of a life well lived, openly addressing the mental health issues many commonly face and, in doing so, showing readers that acknowledging your emotions is the first step towards healing.\n\nSangeun Lee, an elementary school teacher in Korea, told the BBC the book has held a particularly special meaning to her for that reason.\n\n\"With the rise of social media, we're exposed to other people's lives too much, and it makes us increasingly critical of ourselves,\" the 35-year-old said.\n\n\"Being imperfect is natural for everyone, but seeing so much of this kind of information can feel like an attack on yourself, making you wonder if it's even OK to live the way you do. This book encouraged me to accept myself as I am.\"\n\nThe book's popularity has had a real-world impact, supporting many struggling with depression to seek professional help. It has also brought mental health issues into public conversation - RM of BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group known for songs promoting self-love, is among those who have shared the book online.\n\nBaek's pages have resonated far beyond South Korea. First published in 2018, it has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated into 25 languages. In the UK, it sold 100,000 copies within six months of its release.\n\nIt has struck a chord with young women and played a significant role in expanding the reach of Korean literature. Marianna Szucs, a secondary school teacher in London, told the BBC she felt a connection to it and deep sorrow at Baek's death.\n\n\"Her book tells you that if you feel depressed or feel like you have problems, you are not the only one. She had all sorts of problems, from tiny little things to quite daunting ones. I think anyone who reads this book can find something they can relate to.\"\n\nSeunghye Sun, director of the Korean Cultural Centre UK, said \"it is highly symbolic that Baek Se-hee's voice has found resonance in the UK where great psychoanalysts like Freud and his daughter explored the human mind\", in the process broadening the spectrum of K-literature and K-culture.\n\nHer book tells a story that transcends generations and borders, sending a quiet but warm message to countless nameless readers around the world.\n\nIn the end, the paradoxical title \"I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki\" may, in fact, be another way of saying, \"I want to live.\" Even in moments of deep despair, people often find the strength to carry on through small joys.\n\nFor her, that joy was tteokbokki, and it shows even the simplest pleasures in daily life can become a sustaining force."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"23:48:23.794+00:00","title":"MindsEye: How ex-Grand Theft Auto boss’s grand vision became a £200m flop","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the collapse of Build a Rocket Boy (Barb), a video game studio founded by former Rockstar Games executive Leslie Benzies, following the disastrous launch of its flagship game MindsEye in June 2025.

2025-10-18T23:48:23.794+00:00\n\nTitle: MindsEye: How ex-Grand Theft Auto boss’s grand vision became a £200m flop\n\nIn July this year workers at Build a Rocket Boy, a video game studio in Edinburgh, were called to an all-staff meeting.\n\nTheir first ever game, a sci-fi adventure called MindsEye, had been released three weeks earlier - and it had been a total disaster.\n\nCritics and players called it \"broken\", \"buggy\", and \"the worst game of 2025\".\n\nAddressing staff via video link, the company's boss,   Leslie Benzies, assured them there was a plan to get things back on track and said the negativity they'd seen was \"uncalled for\".\n\nThen he pivoted, alleging \"internal and external\" forces had been working to scupper the MindsEye launch.\n\nHe told the assembled workers - who'd been informed they faced redundancy just a week earlier - there would be an effort to root out \"saboteurs\" within the company.\n\n\"I find it disgusting that anyone could sit amongst us, behave like this and continue to work here,\" he said, according to a transcript of the meeting verified by BBC Newsbeat.\n\nStaff who worked at the studio say they were stunned - and not only by the strength of the language. They simply didn't believe him.\n\nAs far as they were concerned, there was no conspiracy - and the reasons for MindsEye's failure were clear.\n\nMr Benzies is well-known for his work at Rockstar Games where he was a senior figure on the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) action-adventure series, and regarded by many as a key architect of its success.\n\nHe left in 2016, three years after the record-breaking launch of GTA 5, sparking a legal row over unpaid royalties that was settled out of court.\n\nIn the same year, he set up the company that would become Build a Rocket Boy (Barb). By the end of 2024, it had grown to 448 employees.\n\nMost were based at its main office - a former casino in Leith, Edinburgh - but the company also had studios in Budapest and in the French city of Montpellier.\n\nFormer staff say salaries were competitive, the company allowed remote working, and their response to the Covid-19 pandemic was good.\n\nWith Mr Benzies at the helm, Barb attracted a lot of interest and, according to  documents UK companies are legally required to publish online , had managed to attract more than £233m of investment by 2024.\n\nIt had also spent large amounts of money without releasing any products.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, the company posted losses totalling £202.6m, with its largest for a single year - £59.1m - coming in 2023.\n\nBarb's first project was Everywhere, described by one former employee, Jamie (not their real name), as a multiplayer role-playing game (RPG) based in an open-ended, futuristic city.\n\n\"I thought we had something quite special,\" says Jamie, who left the company in 2022.\n\nTo fulfill the vision, Jamie says, Mr Benzies requested new ideas and features be added at breakneck speed - too fast for them to be properly implemented.\n\nThe studio's main focus would eventually shift to MindsEye - a game originally intended to be offered as an experience within Everywhere.\n\n\"Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,\" says Jamie. \"There was no coherent direction\".\n\nThis style of working \"plagued the project from the start\", they say, and would be a sign of things to come.\n\nAn open letter, recently signed by 93 current and former Barb employees, alleges studio management made \"radical changes\" without properly consulting workers.\n\nFormer lead data analyst Ben Newbon says it was common for staff to be caught off-guard by \"knee-jerk\" decisions from upper management without proper explanation.\n\nThe letter further alleges that leadership \"repeatedly refused to listen\" to its experienced workforce.\n\nBen, whose team was tasked with collecting feedback and presenting it to management, says there was rarely any response when they flagged issues.\n\n\"A lot of the points that we were hammering home on were just ignored and just never actioned,\" he says.\n\nHis former colleague, associate producer Margherita \"Marg\" Peloso, says the studio's culture also discouraged individuals from speaking out.\n\nMarg, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, says their own attempts to raise concerns were \"laughed at\" in meetings with bosses.\n\nStaff also accuse Mr Benzies of micro-managing the studio, a process allegedly illustrated in a  video uploaded to the official MindsEye YouTube account .\n\nIt shows the director instructing an onlooker to make a note of an issue he has noticed as he plays the game.\n\nDevelopers say this was a regular occurrence, resulting in what Ben and Marg claim were known within the studio as \"Leslie tickets\".\n\nJamie says they also heard them referred to as \"Leslie bugs\" or, simply, \"Leslies\".\n\nDevelopers told Newsbeat these could range from minor cosmetic issues to instructions to ditch whole missions from the game, and there was an expectation that these would be given top priority.\n\n\"It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on,\" says Ben, \"the Leslie ticket had to be taken care of.\"\n\nJamie says the practice introduced instability and prevented teams from \"taking ownership of their work\".\n\nDevelopers say the decision to launch MindsEye in June 2025 prompted a period of \"crunch\" - a games industry term for mandatory overtime.\n\nThey say this meant an extra eight hours of unpaid overtime a week for the majority of staff - although some employees were excused from it.\n\nMarg says the crunch began in mid-February and continued into May, with workers eventually being promised seven hours of leave per eight hours' overtime, to be taken after MindsEye's release.\n\n\"People just felt like they were being commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return,\" says Marg.\n\nBen alleges that some departments, such as the quality assurance team, were particularly affected, with some staff suffering physically and mentally as a result of the \"stress and pressure\".\n\nFormer audio programmer Isaac Hudd says \"mistakes started piling up\" during crunch, and says \"regressions\", where one team would fix a bug only for another to unwittingly bring it back to life, became increasingly common.\n\n\"And it does mess with you,\" he says. \"You really do start to see the morale go down, the little arguments starting to happen.\n\n\"People are burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: 'What's the point?'\"\n\nMarg says many at the studio expected MindsEye to receive a negative reception on launch, describing the approach to its release as \"everybody holding their breath\".\n\nNevertheless, staff gathered in Barb's Edinburgh studio to celebrate MindsEye's launch on 10 June.\n\nMarg says: \"Everybody was drinking champagne, just having a good time, which was quite… heartwarming, I guess.\n\n\"At the same time, it really felt like this is the last good thing that's going to happen.\"\n\nThe celebrations were short-lived.\n\nBarb had not shared advance copies of MindsEye with reviewers, but when early impressions of the game began to surface, the mood soured.\n\nPlayers who bought the game on release day encountered major performance issues and reported various bugs, including pedestrians that appeared to walk on air and, in one heavily-memed example, one character's face appeared to melt due to a graphical glitch.\n\nTwitch streamer CohhCarnage told viewers he was instructed to cancel a sponsored launch day stream at the last-minute, as word of the game's problems spread.\n\nAudio programmer Isaac says he had maintained some optimism in the run-up to the release, but started to lose hope fairly quickly.\n\n\"You were just seeing disastrous review after disastrous review, and thinking 'This isn't gonna go well',\" he says.\n\nMarg says the team spent the next two weeks working on \"hotfixes\" - small, targeted updates to address major issues, until management informed them that they were at risk of being laid off.\n\nThis month, between 250 and 300 Barb staff lost their jobs, with the bulk of those roles based in Edinburgh, according to The Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union's Game Workers Branch.\n\nThe union, which put out the open letter on behalf of 93 employees, said it also planned to take legal action against Barb over what it called \"disastrous mishandling\" of the redundancy process.\n\nBen, who is a member of the union, says he took voluntary redundancy, but fellow members Marg and Isaac, who were laid off, say they were unhappy with how their departures were handled.\n\nIn a statement, Barb said staff had \"poured passion, creativity, and hard work into our games and our studio\", adding that it was \"deeply saddened\" and \"didn't anticipate having to make redundancies after launch\".\n\nIt said it approached the redundancy process with \"care and transparency\", meeting all of its obligations, and was \"committed to learning and growing\" from former employees' feedback.\n\nIn response to complaints about studio leadership, workplace culture and claims of \"internal and external\" forces working against the studio, Barb said: \"Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for the initial launch [of MindsEye].\n\n\"The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.\"\n\nIt said it remained committed to \"ultimately delivering MindsEye as the game we always envisioned - and the one players are excited to play\".\n\nThe statement added that the studio had already rolled out updates to address issues, and was working on \"enhancements\" and \"fresh new content\".\n\nThe ex-workers who spoke to BBC Newsbeat say they are doubtful that MindsEye can recover from its launch.\n\nThey are also pessimistic about their own future prospects and those of former colleagues in an industry which has seen tens of thousands of job losses over the past three years.\n\nBen says the impact will be felt in the Scottish development scene, too.\n\n\"It's really sad to see what could have been an amazing opportunity for the industry up here wasted,\" he says.\n\nDespite the negativity around MindsEye and Barb, Isaac says, some of his colleagues were \"incredibly talented\" and \"some of the best people\" he's ever worked with.\n\nMarg says they decided to speak out because of those colleagues - and in the hope something will change.\n\n\"We all know each other, and we know how much we're worth,\" Marg says. \"We need to stand together.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

dead hostages to be returned to Israel from Gaza has said her father is \"finally home\".\n\nRonen Engel's daughter, Mika, wrote on Instagram: \"It's not what we hoped, it's not what we wished for him, but it's finally here.\"\n\nThe remains of Mr Engel, 54, a photographer, and 30-year-old Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri were the latest to be returned by Hamas on Saturday.\n\nBoth were killed during the 7 October 2023 attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza, the IDF said. They are the 11th and 12th of 28 dead hostages to be returned under the ceasefire deal.\n\nMr Engel's wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their teenage daughters were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023 during a truce between Israel and Hamas. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Mr Engel had been killed in captivity.\n\nIsrael's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that Mr Engel was remembered by loved ones as a man with \"hands of gold and the soul of an artist\".\n\nHe was a photographer and volunteer ambulance driver for Israel's emergency service Magen David Adom.\n\nThe second dead hostage returned was identified by Israel on Sunday as Sonthaya Akrasri, a Thai agricultural worker who was killed on 7 October while living at Kibbutz Be'eri. Thailand's foreign ministry announced his death in May 2024.\n\nHe was the father of a seven-year-old daughter and had planned to return to Thailand to open his own farm, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.\n\nThe delay in the return of the dead hostages has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages - living and dead. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the remaining bodies under the rubble in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.\n\nThe IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".\n\nBut the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on  a visit to Israel and Egypt last week .\n\nThe text of the deal has not been published, but  a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media  appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.\n\nHamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.\n\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.\n\nAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel.\n\nAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\n\nThe bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.\n\nSeparately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were  killed by an Israeli tank shell , according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.\n\nThe Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.\n\nThere are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.\n\nAt least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\n\nIn September, a UN commission of inquiry said  Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians  in Gaza.

homeland rebuilt before but this time's different'\n\n\"I rode away on a camel with my grandmother, along a sandy road, and I started to cry.\" Ayish Younis is describing the worst moment of his life – he still regards it as such, even though it was 77 years ago, and he's lived through many horrors since.\n\nIt was 1948, the first Arab-Israeli war was raging, and Ayish was 12. He and his whole extended family were fleeing their homes in the village of Barbara - famed for its grapes, wheat, corn and barley - in what had been British-ruled Palestine.\n\n\"We were scared for our lives,\" Ayish says. \"On our own, we had no means to fight the Jews, so we all started to leave.\"\n\nThe camel took Ayish and his grandmother seven miles south from Barbara, to an area held by Egypt that would become known as the Gaza Strip. It was just 25 miles long and a few miles wide, and had just become occupied by Egyptian forces.\n\nIn all an estimated 700,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees as a result of the war of 1948-49; around 200,000 are believed to have crowded into that tiny coastal corridor.\n\n\"We had bits of wood which we propped against the walls of a building to make a shelter,\" Ayish says.\n\nLater, they moved into one of the huge tented camps established by the United Nations.\n\nToday, aged 89, Ayish is again living in a tent in Al-Mawasi near Khan Younis.\n\nIn May last year, seven months into the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, Ayish was forced to leave his home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah after an evacuation order from the Israeli military.\n\nThe four-storey house, divided into several apartments, that he had shared with his children and their families, was destroyed by what he believes may have been Israeli tank-fire.\n\nNow, home is a small white canvas tent just a few metres across.\n\nOther members of the family are in neighbouring tents. They have all had to cook on an open fire. With no access to running water they wash using canned water, which is scarce and as a result expensive.\n\n\"We returned to what we started with, we returned back to tents, and we still don't know how long we will be here,\" he says, sitting in a plastic chair on the bare sand outside his tent, with clothes drying on a washing line nearby.\n\nA walking frame is propped beside him, as he moves with difficulty. But he still speaks in the crystal-clear, melodious Arabic of one who studied literature, and recited the Quran daily as the imam of a local mosque.\n\n\"After we left Barbara and lived in a tent, we eventually succeeded in building a house. But now, the situation is more than a catastrophe. I don't know what the future holds, and whether we will ever be able to rebuild our house again.\"\n\n\"And in the end I just want to go back to Barbara, with my whole extended family, and again taste the fruit that I remember from there.\"\n\nOn 9 October, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The remaining living 20 Hamas-held hostages were returned to Israel and Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners.\n\nYet despite widespread rejoicing over the ceasefire, Ayish is not optimistic about the long-term prospects for Gaza.\n\n\"I hope the peace will spread and it will be calm,\" he says. \"But I believe the Israelis will do whatever they like.\"\n\nUnder the agreement for the first stage of the ceasefire, Israel will retain control of more than half the Gaza Strip, including Rafah.\n\nOne question Ayish, his family and all Gazans are pondering is whether their homeland will ever be successfully rebuilt.\n\nBack in 1948, the Egyptian army had been one of five Arab armies that had invaded the British-controlled territory of Mandate Palestine the day after the establishment of a Jewish state, Israel. But they soon withdrew, defeated, from Barbara, prompting Ayish's decision to flee.\n\nAyish became a teacher when he was 19, and gained a literature degree in Cairo under a scholarship programme.\n\nThe best moment of his life, he says, was when he married his wife Khadija. Together they had 18 children. That, according to a newspaper article that once featured him, is a record – the largest number of children from the same mother and father of any Palestinian family.\n\nToday, he has 79 grandchildren, two of them born in the last few months.\n\nThe family would move from their first tent to a simple three-room cement house with an asbestos roof in the refugee camp, which they later extended to nine rooms – thanks partly to wages earned in Israel.\n\nWhen the border between Israel and Gaza opened, and Ayish's eldest son Ahmed was one of many Palestinians who took advantage of that, working in an Israeli restaurant during his holidays, while studying medicine in Egypt.\n\n\"During that time, in Israel, people were paid very well. And this is the period of time where the Palestinians made most of their money,\" he says.\n\nAll but one of Ayish's children gained university degrees. They became engineers, nurses, teachers. Several moved abroad. Five are in Gulf countries and Ahmed, a specialist in spinal cord injuries, now lives in London. Many other Gazan families are similarly scattered.\n\nThe Younis family, like many Gazans, wanted nothing to do with politics. Ayish became an imam at a Rafah mosque – and a local headman (or mukhtar) responsible for settling disputes, just as his uncle had been years earlier in the village of Barbara.\n\nHe was not appointed by the government – but he says that both Hamas and the Fatah political movement, the dominant party in the Palestinian authority, respected him.\n\nThat didn't save the family from tragedy, though, during the street battles of 2007, when Fatah and Hamas fought for control of the Strip. Ayish's daughter Fadwa was killed in cross-fire as she sat in a car.\n\nThe rest of the family survived through wars between Hamas and Israel in 2008, 2012, 2014 – as well as the devastating war triggered by the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.\n\nThen came that evacuation order by the Israeli military who said they were carrying out operations against Hamas in the area, forcing them to leave their Rafah home and over a year spent living in makeshift tents.\n\nAyish's life has come full circle since 1948. But his greatest desire is to go even further back in time, to return to the village, now in Israel, which he last saw when he was 12 – even though it no longer exists.\n\nApart from clothes, cooking pots and a few other essentials, the only possessions he has with him in his tent are the precious title deeds to his ancestral land in Barbara.\n\nThoughts are now turning to the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nBut Ayish believes the extent of the destruction – of infrastructure, schools and health services – is so great that it cannot be fully repaired, even with the help of the international community.\n\n\"I don't believe Gaza has any future,\" he says.\n\nHe believes that his grandchildren could play a role in the reconstruction of Gaza if the ceasefire is fully implemented, but he does not believe they will be able to find jobs in the territory as good as those they have or could get abroad.\n\nHis son Haritha, a graduate in Arabic language who has four daughters and a son, is also living in a tent. \"An entire generation has been destroyed by this war.\n\n\"We are unable to comprehend it,\" he says.\n\n\"We used to hear from our fathers and grandfathers about the 1948 war and how difficult the displacement was, but there is no comparison between 1948 and what happened in this war.\n\n\"We hope that our children will have a role in rebuilding, but as Palestinians, do we have the capacity on our own to rebuild the schools? Will donor countries play a role in that?\"\n\n\"My daughter has gone through two years of war without schooling, and for two years before that schools were closed because of Covid,\" he continues. \"I used to work in a clothing store, but it was destroyed.\n\n\"We don't know how things will unfold or how we will have a source of income. There are so many questions we have no answers for. We simply don't know what the future holds.\"\n\nAnother of Ayish's sons, Nizar, a trained nurse, who lives in a tent nearby, agrees. He believes Gaza's problems are so great that the youngest generation of the family will not be able to play much role, despite their high level of education.\n\n\"The situation is unbearable,\" he says. \"We hope that life will return to how it was before the war. But the destruction is massive - total destruction of buildings and infrastructure, psychological devastation within the community, and the destruction of universities.\"\n\nAyish's eldest son Ahmed, in London, meanwhile reflects on how it took the family more than 30 years to build their former home into what it eventually became - as money was saved over the years it was expanded, he explains.\n\n\"Do I have another 30 years to work and try to help and support my family? This is really the situation all the time - every 10 to 15 years, people lose everything and they come back to square one.\"\n\nAnd yet he still dreams of living in Rafah again when he retires. \"My brothers in the Gulf bought land in Rafah to come back and settle as well. My son, and my nephews and nieces - they want to go back.\"\n\nWith a pause, he adds: \"By nature, I'm very optimistic, because I know how determined our Gaza people are. Trust me, they will go back and start to rebuild their lives again.\n\n\"The hope is always in the new generation to rebuild.\"\n\nTop picture credit: AFP via Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Some think so - but not everyone's impressed\n\nDamar, one of the best surf guides on the Indonesian island of Lombok, feels right at home taking tourists out to sea.\n\nWith his fluent English and effortless banter, you would never guess what was his childhood fear: foreigners.\n\n\"When I was 10 or maybe seven, I used to cry - I used to just pee in my pants when I saw white people,\" Damar, now 39, tells the BBC.\n\nThat diffidence waned as the laidback island he calls home slowly found its popularity among Western travellers.\n\nJust east of Bali, Lombok boasts the same azure beaches and stunning views as its famous neighbour, but without the exasperating crowds. Lombok's beaches are still a hidden gem among surfers, as is Mount Rinjani for hikers. Travel sites still liberally use the word \"untouched\" to describe the island as they offer reasons to venture beyond Bali.\n\nSo it should come as little surprise that the Indonesian government has sensed the opportunity to create another lucrative tourist haven on the sprawling archipelago.\n\nThe mission is to create more \"Balis\" - and Lombok will be one of them.\n\nFor islanders, this promise of \"Balification\" is a welcome opportunity but they are also wary of what it brings.\n\nAnd the change has already begun to hit home in more ways than one.\n\nMandalika in the south has been chosen as the heart of the \"new Bali\".\n\nIts rustic coastline has already given way to glitzy resorts, cafes and even a racetrack. Earlier this month, nearly 150,000 spectators showed up to watch the motorcycle Grand Prix.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, dozens of families were evicted from their village homes for the construction of the Mandalika circuit. Damar's was among them.\n\nConfronted with what activists decried as a messy resettlement plan and unfair compensation, he and his neighbours were helpless, Damar recalls.\n\n\"I was angry, but I cannot do much. I cannot fight against the government,\" he says.\n\nSince the eviction, Damar has bought a plot of land and built his own house, something that many of his neighbours haven't been able to do. As a surf guide, he estimates that he earns twice as much as a fisherman - a generational profession in his community.\n\n\"I've never really been to school, so joining the tourism industry was one of the best choices that I have ever made,\" Damar says. \"Meeting a lot of people from many different countries… It has opened my mind.\"\n\nDamar's indignation about his eviction even comes with a scrupulous caveat: \"I'm not angry at the tourists. I'm just angry at my own government.\"\n\nThe drive to transform Lombok is part of a wider effort to lure travellers away from Bali, which has for decades played an outsized role in Indonesia's tourism industry.\n\nThe island makes up less than 1% of the country's land area and less than 2% of its 280 million-plus population. Yet last year it accounted for nearly half of all visitors to Indonesia.\n\nBut increasingly Bali's unrelenting traffic and pollution - a direct result of its success as a top tourist pick- are leaving those very tourists disappointed with what has long been touted as the \"last paradise\".\n\nAs it turns out, that elusive paradise lies just an hour's boat ride away.\n\nBut perhaps not for long.\n\nMore and more travellers are catching on to Lombok's appeal. Last year, 81,500 foreign tourists touched down at its airport, a 40% jump from the year before - still, a far cry from the 6.3 million foreigners who flocked to Bali.\n\nEager for Lombok to follow in Bali's footsteps, Indonesian authorities have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, along with a $250m loan from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\n\nThis has accelerated the island's makeover.\n\nIn Kuta, a popular town in Mandalika, scrappy surfers' hostels have been replaced by a mosaic of chlorinated pools and plushy sunbeds, and an international school for the children of expats.\n\nWhile authorities are hailing it as Lombok's success story, some see a cautionary tale.\n\nA stone's throw away on the beach of Tanjung Aan, cafe owner Kartini Lumban Raja told the BBC that locals there \"don't want to be 'organised' like Kuta\".\n\n\"When beaches start to look like Kuta, they lose their charm. We lose opportunities. We lose natural beauty,\" she said.\n\nFor months, rumours of evictions had been swirling on Tanjung Aan, which was earmarked for ambitious development plans.\n\nDays after the BBC's visit in July, they came like a rolling wave.\n\nSecurity forces descended upon the beach to demolish nearly 200 stalls, including Kartini's.\n\nVideos from that day show masked men tearing shop fences down with their bare hands as stall owners protested.\n\n\"They were banging on things, kicking plywood… it's truly inhumane,\" Ella Nurlaila, a stall owner, told the BBC. \"My goodness, this eviction was so cruel.\"\n\nThe state-owned company leading Mandalika's tourism drive, InJourney Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), has secured 2.1 trillion rupiah ($128m; £96m) to build a luxury hotel on Tanjung Aan.\n\nAuthorities said the project will create jobs and boost the local economy. But that's little consolation for stall owners like Ella and her husband Adi, who have sold coconuts and coffee on the beach for the past three years.\n\n\"Thousands of people here depend on [coastal land] for their livelihood,\" Adi said. \"Where else are we supposed to go to earn a living?\"\n\nThe couple said they had paid taxes for their stall - which, according to Adi, sat on land belonging to his parents.\n\nBut ITDC representatives told the BBC that Tanjung Aan is \"state-owned land\", and that the tax paid by those businesses \"does not equate to legal ownership or land legitimacy\".\n\nThis is just the latest bout of tensions over Mandalika's tourism push.\n\nJust Finance International, a development finance watchdog, has repeatedly flagged \"a pattern of rights violations linked to the Mandalika project\" in recent years.\n\nUN human rights experts estimate that more than 2,000 people \"lost their primary means of livelihood overnight\" because of the Tanjung Aan evictions. Stall owners were given neither \"adequate notice\" nor \"suitable\" resettlement plans, they said in a statement in August.\n\n\"The people of Mandalika must not be sacrificed for a project that promises economic growth at the expense of human rights,\" they said.\n\nIn its quest for a remarkably different future, Lombok will also have to contend with what this means for local culture.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim island is home to thousands of mosques and the indigenous Sasak ethnic group. Compared to Bali, alcohol is not as readily available in parts of the island. On travel forums, tourists are encouraged to ditch bikinis and hot pants for more modest attire.\n\nSuch conservative sensitivities may change, or at least be driven further inland, as tourism heats up along the coastline. Travellers who have come to love Lombok are not happy about that either.\n\n\"Lombok is so special because it still has its own nature and people come to see that,\" said Swiss tourist Basil Berger, a sceptic of the\"Bali-fication\" of the island.\n\n\"If they want to see Bali, they [should] go to Bali,\" he said. Turning Lombok into another Bali \"is the \"the worst thing that they can do\".\n\nThere are also environmental concerns. The motorcycle Grand Prix last year drew 120,000 spectators to Mandalika, leaving behind 30 tonnes of rubbish that authorities struggled to clear.\n\n\"Before it gets to Bali's stage of development, Lombok could learn. Because it's showing the same kind of strain,\" says Sekar Utami Setiastuti, who lives in Bali.\n\nThe government should ensure \"tourism development brings welfare to a lot of people, instead of just bringing tourists to Lombok\", she adds. \"Lombok has to find its own identity - not just [become] a less crowded Bali.\"\n\nNo matter where that search leads, a new era has dawned on Lombok.\n\nAndrew Irwin is among the foreign investors who have taken an early interest in Lombok's budding tourism. The American is the co-owner of LMBK Surf House, one of Mandalika's most popular surf camps.\n\nThe way he sees it, businesses like his are helping to uplift local employees and their families.\n\n\"It's giving people more opportunities to earn more money, send their kids to proper school, get proper insurance, get proper healthcare, and essentially live a better quality of life,\" he said.\n\nWhile there's \"not necessarily much one can do\" about Lombok's changing landscape, he says, \"we can just hope to bring a positive change to the equation\".\n\nTourism has certainly ushered prosperity into the lives of many locals, who have decided to try their hand at entrepreneurship.\n\n\"As long you want to work, you'll make money from tourism,\" says Baiq Enida Kinang Lare, a homestay owner in Kuta, known to her guests as Lara. Her neighbours too have started homestays.\n\nLara started her business in 2014 with four rooms. She's now at 14, not counting a separate villa under construction.\n\nAs excited as she is about her prospects, she is also a little wistful as she recalled life before the hustle.\n\n\"It's difficult to find time to gather and see everyone. This is what we miss. We feel like the time flies very, very fast because we're busy,\" she says.\n\nThis is a feeling that would surely be shared by locals from Bali to Mykonos to Cancun, whenever tourism took off in their patch of paradise: \"I miss the past, but we like the money.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"06:11:20.054+00:00","title":"Millions join anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests across US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Americans took to the streets in large-scale 'No Kings' protests across major US cities, including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles, expressing outrage over President Donald Trump’s expansion of executive power, immigration crackdowns, and healthcare cuts.

President Donald Trump's policies in cities across the US, including New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.\n\nThousands packed New York City's iconic Times Square and streets all around, with people holding signs with slogans like \"Democracy not Monarchy\" and \"The Constitution is not optional\".\n\nAhead of the demonstrations, Trump allies accused the protesters of being linked with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\".\n\nSeveral US states had mobilised the National Guard. But organisers said the events, which drew nearly seven million people, were peaceful.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has expanded the scope of presidential power, using executive orders to dismantle parts of the federal government and to deploy National Guard troops to US cities despite objections by state governors.\n\nHe has also called on the administration's top law enforcement officials to prosecute his perceived enemies.\n\nThe president says his actions are necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and has dismissed accusations that he is a behaving like a dictator or fascist as hysterical.\n\nBut critics warn some of the moves by his administration are unconstitutional and a threat to American democracy.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday, Trump appeared to address the rallies.\n\n\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know – they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"\n\nIn New York, sections of the crowd regularly erupted into chants of \"This is what democracy looks like\" as a near-constant drumbeat boomed in the background.\n\nHelicopters and drones could be seen flying overhead, and police stood on the sidelines.\n\nThe New York Police Department said more than 100,000 people had gathered across all five of the city's boroughs, and that no protest-related arrests were made.\n\nIn Times Square, a police officer standing by estimated that over 20,000 were marching down 7th Avenue.\n\nBeth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, said she had joined the New York protest because she feels outraged and distressed at \"a move toward fascism and an authoritarian government\" happening under the Trump administration.\n\n\"I care a lot about New York City,\" she said.\n\n\"It gives me hope to be out here with many, many other people.\"\n\nMassimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said he was protesting because he was concerned the US was following the same path that his home country did in the last century.\n\nMr Mascoli said he was particularly worried about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and healthcare cuts for millions of Americans.\n\n\"We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government,\" he told the BBC. \"We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting.\"\n\nIn Washington, DC, where the National Guard guard has been deployed since August at Trump's request, no troops were visible at the protest, either.\n\nOne protester at the rally in the capital held up a sign that read \"I am Antifa\".\n\nChuck Epes, 76, said it was a \"loaded\" term, and just meant he supported \"peace, daycare, liveable wage, healthcare\", as well as immigrants and people of colour.\n\n\"He's gaslighting everybody - or trying to, and it ain't working,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic politicians joined the protests around the country.\n\n\"We have no dictators in America. And we won't allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X alongside photos of himself holding up a sign that read \"fix the health care crisis\" in New York.\n\nIn Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a keynote speech.\n\n\"We're not here because we hate America, we're here because we love America,\" he said to a crowd of thousands.\n\nDemocratic senators Cory Booker and Adam Schiff also posted videos of themselves attending protests, thanking Americans for showing up across the country.\n\n\"This is what democracy looks like. Thank you all of America for speaking out,\" Schiff said.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy shared footage of the huge turnout in his home state of Connecticut: \"Breathtaking. This is why today will likely go down as the biggest day of peaceful protest in our nation's 250 year history.\"\n\nRepublican governors in several US states had placed National Guard troops on standby ahead of the protests.\n\nThe move was denounced by Democrats, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: \"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do - and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.\"\n\nVirginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated, though local reports said troops were not present during the protest.\n\nThe protests weren't confined to the US.\n\nThroughout Europe, there were also demonstrations Berlin, Madrid and Rome as people showed solidarity with their American counterparts. In London, several hundred protesters gathered outside the US embassy.\n\nThere were similar scenes in Toronto, where demonstrators near the US consulate waved signs including \"Hands off Canada\".\n\nAmericans are deeply divided on Donald Trump.\n\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 40% approved of his performance as president, while 58% disapproved. This puts him about on par with his average approval rating during his first term, but lower than his 47% approval rating when he took office for the second time in January.\n\nIt is common for presidents to become more unpopular as their term wears on. Joe Biden had a 55% approval rating, according to Reuters/Ipsos, in January 2021. By October of that year, his approval had declined to 46%.\n\nWith additional reporting by Ana Faguy"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3z0pypnpro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"03:55:24.262+00:00","title":"Limp Bizkit bassist Sam Rivers dies aged 48","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sam Rivers, the founding bassist and a central creative force in the nu metal band Limp Bizkit, has died at the age of 48.

While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned.\n\nMr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".\n\nTwo years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence.\n\nThroughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges.\n\nHis supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime.\n\nMr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated.\n\nEarlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.\n\nBut Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence.\n\nThe family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said.\n\nThe facts of the case are different now, she stressed.\n\nBut when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility.\n\nWhile he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.\n\nICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation.\n\nMr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\n\n\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"\n\nThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best.\n\nWhile he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.\n\nHis community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada.\n\n\"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"\n\nMr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\n\n\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xg1jve73o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:53:02.222+00:00","title":"Colombia accuses US of 'murder' after strike on boat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing 'murder' after a US naval strike killed fisherman Alejandro Carranza in Colombian territorial waters on 15 September 2025.

boat\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of committing \"murder\" following a strike carried out on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.\n\nIn a social media post, Petro accused the US of violating his country's sovereignty and killing a Colombian fisherman.\n\nPosting on X, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump said the US had struck a \"drug-carrying submarine\" on Thursday, killing two people.\n\nWriting on social media, Trump said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\".\n\nThe attack is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.\n\nWriting about an earlier attack in September, Pedro wrote on X on Saturday that: \"US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.\n\n\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"\n\nAlejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.\n\nTrump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.\n\nUN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".\n\nAt least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.\n\nTrump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the submarine targeted in the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\".\n\n\"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he said, adding that no US military personnel had been injured.\n\nThe US president also said two people who survived would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nThey were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".\n\nTrump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.\n\nNarco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery.

2025-10-17T23:42:24.234+00:00\n\nTitle: Fentanyl: How the US is emerging from its drugs death epidemic\n\nKayla first tried fentanyl as a troubled 18-year-old, growing up in the US state of North Carolina.\n\n\"I felt like literally amazing.  The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted,\" she remembers.\n\nThe little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.\n\nBut drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?\n\n\"It's scary to think about that,\" Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.\n\nIn 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.\n\nBut then came a staggering turnaround.\n\nIn 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.\n\nOne of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.\n\nIn North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.\n\nKayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.\n\n\"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history. And often we see that the crimes they're committing appear to fund the addiction they have,\" says Lt Jamaal Littlejohn.\n\nThis might make them a candidate for the LEAD programme, meaning they can get support to tackle their addiction, and can start thinking about secure housing and employment.\n\nThe proponents of LEAD say it isn't about being soft on crime. Drug dealers still go to prison in Fayetteville. \"But if we can get people the services they need, it gives law enforcement more time to deal with bigger crimes,\" argues Lt Littlejohn, who watched his own sister struggle with a substance use disorder.\n\nKayla has blossomed. She's such a long way now from the days when she used prostitution to fund her fentanyl habit. As part of the LEAD process, her criminal record has been wiped. She recently graduated as a certified nurse assistant, and is now working in a residential home.\n\n\"It's like the best thing ever. This is the longest time I've been clean,\" she says.\n\nCritical to Kayla's recovery has been treatment. She's been taking methadone for nearly a year when she tells her story to the BBC. \"It's keeping me from going back,\" she believes.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine are medications used to treat opioid use disorder.  They stem cravings and stop painful withdrawal. Nationwide, treatment has played a role in puncturing the overdose fatality statistics.\n\nIn North Carolina, it's been a game-changer: more than 30,000 people were enrolled in a programme in 2024, with numbers climbing in 2025.\n\nAt 09:00 at one of the Morse Clinics in the state capital of Raleigh, two or three people wait their turn in reception.\n\n\"The busiest time is 5.30am to 7am, so before work,\" says Dr Eric Morse, an addiction psychiatrist running nine clinics offering medication assisted treatment (MAT) in North Carolina. \"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day.\"\n\nThe clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes.\n\nThey'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.\n\n\"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly,\" says Dr Morse.\n\nThis is harm reduction.  So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling.  Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether.  And in time, many will taper off their medication too.\n\nNot everyone thinks this is the right approach.\n\nMark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic. He points out that illegal drug-taking starts with a choice.\n\nAnd he doesn't believe in harm reduction. In particular he's against treating opioid use disorder with medications like methadone or buprenorphine.\n\n\"You're replacing an addictive product with another addictive product,\" he says. \"If you have to take it in order to stay clean, it's still addictive. We've got to figure out how to get people to where they can do better – we can't leave them on drugs forever.\"\n\nHe favours abstinence treatment programmes, when drug users go \"cold turkey\".\n\nBut there's pushback from health professionals in North Carolina.\n\n\"I believe there are multiple paths to recovery,\" says Dr Morse. \"I'm not pooh-poohing abstinence-based treatment - except when you look at the medical evidence.\"\n\nDr Morse references  a Yale University study from 2023  analysing the risk of death for opioid users in a treatment programme compared to people not in treatment.  The study suggested that someone in abstinence treatment was as likely - or more more likely - to have a fatal overdose as a person who wasn't in treatment and was continuing to use street opioids like fentanyl.\n\nTreatment aside, another drug is helping.\n\nNaloxone is widely available, and used as a nasal spray it reverses the effect of an opioid overdose, helping someone breathe again. In North Carolina in 2024, it was administered more than 16,000 times. That's potentially 16,000 lives saved – and these are only the overdose reversals that have been reported.\n\n\"This is as close to a miracle drug as we can ever imagine,\" says Dr Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist specialising in street drugs at the University of North Carolina.\n\nMany users of narcotics like cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin want to know that what they're taking won't kill them. Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.\n\nBut the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.\n\n\"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years,\" he says.\n\nTesting drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.\n\n\"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age,\" he says.\n\nDr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.\n\nIt was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.\n\nJosh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\n\"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them,\" Stein reflects.\n\nThe upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the \"abatement of the opioid epidemic\". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.\n\n\"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative,\" says Governor Stein.\n\nMeanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.\n\nIn the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.\n\nAnd there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.\n\nNo one is complacent. Least of all Kayla.\n\nIn the grip of fentanyl for three long years, she never overdosed herself, but she did have to save her friends. Kayla's parents didn't know what to do with her.\n\n\"They kind of gave up on me - they thought I was gonna be dead,\" she remembers.\n\nKayla credits Charlton Roberson, her harm reduction mentor, as being instrumental in her recovery.  Her aim now is to taper off methadone and become medication- and drug-free. She also wants to find a job in a hospital.\n\n\"I feel more alive than I ever did when I was using fentanyl,\" she says.\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via  the BBC Action Line ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p7xzz4lvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:08:47.333+00:00","title":"What's next for Sarah Ferguson, Eugenie and Beatrice?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the aftermath of Prince Andrew's removal from royal titles due to his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which has significantly impacted his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lost her duchess title and faced public backlash over a 2011 email in which she referred to Epstein as her 'supreme friend'.

it's sending ripples through his family too.\n\nHis ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.\n\nTheir daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.\n\nPrince Andrew  lost use of his Duke of York title  over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSo, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?\n\nFor Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.\n\nFor all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.\n\nAnd while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\n\n\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"\n\nBut the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.\n\nLast month,  several charities dropped her as patron  or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\n\n\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\n\n\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"\n\nAway from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.\n\nAnd these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\n\n\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revelations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"\n\nBut Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.\n\nEven though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.\n\nThe Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.\n\nThat ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\n\n\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholl.\n\n\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"\n\nNicholl argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\n\n\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"\n\nFor the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.\n\nThey will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.\n\nThere is also no change to the line of succession.\n\nAndrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.\n\nBut in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\n\n\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.\n\nBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\n\n\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.\n\nThey have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.\n\nPrince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\n\n\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\n\n\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholl.\n\n\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"\n\nUltimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.\n\nFor a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.\n\nSo to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd670x96600o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"22:51:25.015+00:00","title":"As Prince Andrew gives up titles, what difference will it really make?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has renounced his royal titles and honours, including the Duke of York title, following a public outcry over his alleged connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

event now for at least six months. And then maybe only once or twice a year.\n\nBanned from royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham he won't be on the annual church walk. It could be April 2026, at the Easter church service, before he reappears on such a family occasion, maybe longer.\n\nBut when he resurfaces, how much will his life have really changed, despite the drama of the loss of his titles and honours?\n\nThe move against Andrew followed a public outcry for some kind of sanction and there's certainly been a powerful symbolic message of displeasure - but will it really end the accusing headlines and will his daily life be much affected?\n\nBuckingham Palace will hope that this will be seen as a decisive intervention, ending the drip-drip of scandal.\n\nThe King was in Scotland when Andrew made his decision on giving up his titles and reportedly spoke to his brother on the phone.\n\nHe had consulted Prince William, who has all the warmth of an ice age for his uncle Andrew. When William is eventually on the throne, Andrew's royal appearances might be reduced from rare to never.\n\nIt had been William who had already intervened to stop Andrew from walking in the Order of the Garter procession.\n\nThere has been a colossal loss of reputation for Prince Andrew and he'll keenly feel no longer being able to use the Duke of York title and to take part in the Order of the Garter. He's become a persona non-garter.\n\nIt's a deep blow to his pride. But on a day-to-day basis, he's still a prince and he's still living in a mansion in Windsor. Royal Lodge has got a lease until 2078, so if he leaves it will be his own choice.\n\nLiving with him still will be his ex-wife, who is now also an ex-duchess. They've gone back to the position when they first met, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.\n\nHis downfall has been driven by  his links with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . But while Andrew has lost his status, if he ever looks at the infamous photo of him and Virginia Giuffre, everyone else in the picture - Ms Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell - and the person who was claimed to have taken it - Epstein - are either dead or in prison. The prince is the only one who has walked away.\n\nHe can still spend his days watching aviation videos or TV shows. His family life with his daughters, who are still princesses, can continue unchanged.\n\nHis statement about not using his titles, more or less a resignation letter, didn't have any flicker of remorse, continuing to assert his sense of duty and honour. So no change there.\n\nWhen Andrew had to stop being a working royal, in the wake of his Newsnight interview, there was an expectation that he might take the time-worn approach of quiet contrition and some charity work, to gradually regain public respect.\n\nInstead he showed no sense of regret. A royal insider, asked about Andrew's chances of a dignified return to public life, simply said to me: \"The grand old Duke of York, he gave 12 million quid, to someone he never met, for something he never did.\"\n\nIt meant he had never really accepted responsibility for what had happened. Several years later, the only thing that's changed is that he's no longer the Duke of York.\n\nThe intense pressure applied this week by the Palace to Prince Andrew to accept the loss of titles was driven by two key factors, according to royal sources.\n\nFirst, the Palace wanted to stop the cacophony of terrible headlines about Andrew that kept drowning out the rest of the Royal Family's work. They wanted a line drawn under the scandals.\n\nAnd second, there was genuine disquiet at the discovery that Prince Andrew had stayed in touch longer with Epstein than he had previously admitted. If that part of his account was unreliable, what else might emerge?\n\nGetting Prince Andrew to renounce the use of his titles, under the threat of forcibly taking them away, was an attempt to publicly show that the Palace was taking this seriously. They would put an end to his remaining links with royal life.\n\nAlthough this made headlines around the world, it won't stop the underlying questions about Prince Andrew and Epstein and the accompanying headlines.\n\nThis week will see the publication of the  posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre , an Epstein victim who claimed to have been forced to have sex with Andrew.\n\nThe prince has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, but the questions for Andrew about Ms Giuffre and Epstein seem to be getting louder rather than fading away. There could also be questions about what the Palace did or didn't know about Andrew and Epstein's circle.\n\nWhether he's called a prince or an ex-duke, he could still be caught up in the public and political pressure to reveal more documents about Epstein, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe press will keep pulling on other threads, like  Andrew's business dealings with China . Whatever the Palace hopes, the headlines are unlikely to stop.\n\nAt the centre of it all is Prince Andrew, saying nothing now apart from his terse statement, written through gritted teeth, about his titles.\n\nBefore his Newsnight interview in 2019 he had been much more open to talking to the media. I remember speaking to him at an event in 2017 encouraging entrepreneurs.\n\nLooking back it seems unintentionally prophetic.\n\n\"One of the things that I was taught at school was that the best way of being successful is to fail,\" he'd said.\n\n\"If you can learn about failure, and do it in such a way that it's a safe environment… then you will have learnt something, you will have experienced something.\n\n\"How many times did you put your finger in the plug socket as a small child and say 'ow' - and you never did it again.\n\n\"If you did it a second time, you'd think that was really stupid. They've failed and then they've learned what not to do next time,\" said Prince Andrew.\n\n\"You're always stronger from failure.\"\n\nIs that a lesson he was ever good at learning?\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike it blamed Pakistan for.\n\nThe Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead. The three did not play for the national team.\n\nThe strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.\n\nEight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians.\n\nThe ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\n\n\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".\n\nThe attack came hours after  a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan  was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.\n\nPakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed.\n\nPakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".\n\nHe rejected the ICC's \"selective, biased and premature comment\", adding it had not cited any \"independent verification to substantiate these claims\".\n\nIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".\n\nOther players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".\n\nOn Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.\n\nThe strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.\n\nThe 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.\n\nAn Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side.\n\nThe Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.\n\nFormer Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.\n\nIt said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.\n\nZimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series."}]}
