Tens of thousands of callous-handed firefighters and tender veterinarians each year are snubbed in favor of bankable Hollywood stars that, coincidentally, tend to bring attention to suffering magazines. (People Inc., which is owned by Barry Diller’s IAC,  laid off  6 percent of its workforce last month.)\n \n\n   \n  This year, the actor Jonathan Bailey was named to the honorary unpaid position. The “ Wicked ” and “Bridgerton” star is likely the first publicly out gay person to receive the award, unless there’s something we don’t know about some of honorees who preceded him. “It’s the honor of a lifetime,” Bailey told Jimmy Fallon.\n \n\n   \n  The magazine did two covers, one with Bailey’s dog, Benson.\n \n\n   \n  Here are answers to some other questions.\n \n\n   \n    Do they have to eliminate the previous sexiest man each year?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not required to rid society of the outgoing sexiest man. He is simply demoted in sexiness without fanfare. This year’s winner would have “big shoes to fill,” People magazine warned, and those shoes belong to 2024’s sexy fella, John Krasinski. (He is a size 12 US,  according to  Wikifeet.) Krasinski also has the least interesting yet very successful Hollywood career imaginable, but that doesn’t mean he should be exiled or worse. He can next be seen playing glamorous Paramount intellectual property character Jack Ryan, whom he’s played in an Amazon series for four seasons, in the sixth film of the franchise.\n \n\n   \n    What are the criteria for being described as this sexy?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just appearance, the editors of People have said,  mentioning  shadily that “looks aren’t just what the candidates are judged by,” adding that they included Michael B. Jordan because of his political activism. So you can be sexy with an asterisk and feel bad forever.\n \n\n   \n    How much does the award cost and/or pay?\n \n\n   \n  Unknown, actually! Like a presidential library (approaching  a billion dollars ) or a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ($ 85,000 ), the price, if any, of being declared People’s Sexiest Man Alive may be extravagant, but we suspect the real toll is only spiritual. Andrea Lavinthal, the magazine’s Executive Director of Special Integrated Projects, recently  said loudly  that they do not pay the honoree … and that the honoree does not pay the magazine.\n \n\n   \n    Are there other sexy men alive?\n \n\n   \n  A few. The people also get to say who is sexy, and prior to the official announcement, the people’s choices  are announced . They include men as variously sexy as the “sexiest new dad in sports,” who is Christian McCaffrey. The Sexiest Cat Dad title was won by Dave Franco.\n \n\n   \n    Is the prize of being the sexiest man alive cursed?\n \n\n   \n  Yes! Just like many other titles, such as the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and  England’s “Duke of York,”  this one also comes with a dark undercurrent. For instance, all of the people named Sexiest Man Alive are marked for death at a later date. Many have lived through years of war and terrorism. Most will also suffer from divorce, failed franchises, hair loss and sudden hair regrowth. Still, it’s nice to think that having once been named as extremely, extravagantly sexy must keep them warm on the coldest of nights.\n \n\n   \n    Do you want to feel old?\n \n\n   \n  Brad Pitt was first named sexiest man alive in 1995, the same year we got the phrase, “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/china/us-china-red-lines-xie-feng-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:21:00-05:00","title":"China warns Taiwan and human rights remain among its ‘red lines’ after Trump-Xi talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump, China has reaffirmed its four 'red lines'—Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development—as non-negotiable.

after Trump-Xi talks \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:21 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has called for the US to avoid crossing four sensitive “red lines” in order to keep the two countries’ relations on track following a  high-stakes meeting  between leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump last week.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development are “China’s four red lines,” China’s ambassador to the US Xie Feng said during a  virtual address  to American and Chinese businesspeople in Shanghai on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope the US side will avoid crossing them and causing trouble,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Xie made the remarks to an event hosted by the US-China Business Council, according to a readout released by the Chinese Embassy in the US, in comments that come days after Xi and Trump held their landmark meeting last week on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Those talks – the leaders’ first since Trump’s return to the White House earlier this year – have been widely seen as a significant step in de-escalating frictions between the two superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Now, keeping those relations on track would require both sides to “respect each other’s core interests and major concerns,” said Xie, adding that the “pressing priority” was “to follow up on the consensus reached between the two presidents.”\n \n\n   \n  “It would be unacceptable to say one thing but do another, cause any new disruption, make zero-sum calculations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, the four “red lines” elaborated by Xie are longstanding sensitive areas that could enflame tensions if mishandled – the most

marathon \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Ali Truwit crossed the finish line at the Copenhagen Marathon in 2023, she couldn’t have imagined how hard it would be to run the 26.2-mile distance again.\n \n\n   \n  Just 10 days later, she was bitten by a shark while snorkeling in Turks and Caicos and, although she was lucky to escape with her life, her left foot and the lower part of her leg were lost in the attack.\n \n\n   \n  But at the New York City Marathon in 2025, Truwit finished another marathon, completing the most remarkable comeback from  a devastating physical and psychological trauma. \n \n\n   \n  “I’m over the moon,” she exclaimed to CNN in an interview the next day, “I’m definitely feeling the race a little bit, but still feeling on top of the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who’s ever run a marathon will tell you about the grueling nature of the challenge, but few could imagine having to remove their leg multiple times throughout the race.\n \n\n   \n  “Still feels crazy to say,” she said, explaining that the sweat was making her prosthetic limb slip on her leg.\n \n\n   \n  After one such stop, Truwit posted a video to her Instagram story of her bouncing up and down at the side of the road to put her prosthetic back on. Another challenge was her inability to feel the ground beneath her, particularly around the five bridges along the iconic route.\n \n\n   \n  “Learning how to do it without an ankle, which is typically how you adjust for the incline and decline, was totally new,” she said, noting that it was also hard not to slip on all the water and discarded cups around the hydration stations every mile. “There were a lot of nuances to navigate with a blade.”\n \n\n   \n  Since that fateful day in May 2023, Truwit’s journey has been remarkable and inspirational. A competitive swimmer at Yale University, she said that getting back into the water triggered flashbacks of the attack, but within just 16 months she’d conquered her fear to  win two silver medals at the Paralympics in Paris. \n \n\n   \n  In New York, she reclaimed more of her life, running alongside her former teammate Sophie Pilkinton and another 13 family and friends – the people who saved her life and helped her to rebuild it. Pilkinton was there from the start, helping to fight off the shark and swim back to the boat where she applied a life-saving tourniquet; now Truwit says they’re like sisters.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredibly special bond,” Truwit said. “To come through a shark attack like that and survive together and save each other, to be running a marathon side by side, step by step, it’s just such a testament to her support and our friendship. Truly something I’m going to cherish for the rest of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit says that each stage of her recovery has been challenging, but in different ways.\n \n\n   \n  “Swimming was hard because of the traumatic memories I had associated with the water, (but) I don’t swim with my prosthetic, whereas with running I have to use that prosthetic to help me get where I want to go,” she told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s a big challenge, you know, navigate the swelling and all of those frustrations. Running is physically harder; swimming was emotionally harder.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite her obvious triumphs, Truwit says that she’s still recovering from the attack, she’s still a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “Grief comes in waves,” she laments. “I grieve different things at different times. I’ve made a lot of progress on my healing journey, and I think there’s still a-ways to go.”\n \n\n   \n  Many have asked if she had the power to go back and rewrite her history, would she?\n \n\n   \n  “Not to have my life as an amputee would have been easier,” she explained. “I wish it hadn’t happened, but I’m really thankful that I now have this opportunity and platform to impact other people too.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit and her entourage ran New York in blue T-shirts with the name of her charity, “Stronger Than You Think,” stamped in white letters on the back. By the end of the day, they’d raised $220,000. Throughout the race, she glanced at the home screen of her cell phone, a patchwork of the nine women and girls that she has helped to find their own prosthetic limbs.\n \n\n   \n  “I was really shocked at how expensive prosthetics are and how little insurance covers relative to what’s needed,” she said. “These prosthetics are our mobility, our quality of life, our ability to go back to our careers and families and passions, so I wanted to do something about it. It’s been the most healing work for me to take this bad thing and use it for good. Our recipients give me hope and inspiration and joy, and it really was a goal for me, to not just give the prosthetics, but to create community and friendship and support among us.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit’s positive attitude is infectious, she’s able to recall the most awful moment of her life with a smile and the social media videos documenting a painful recovery depict a joyful young woman; it’s as if the experience of being so close to death has infused her with a new love of life.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been given a second chance,” she explained, “I came face to face with that almost not being my reality. You want to live life fully and beautifully and joyfully. Of course, there’s hard moments, I just kind of believe that smiling tricks my brain a little bit, even when I’m in pain or things are hard, I smile to send my body the message, I’m so grateful to be alive right now and I know what a privilege that is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/climate/un-climate-summit-cop30-brazil-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"How the US could shape the COP30 climate summit without even being there","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is not sending any high-level delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, and has publicly stated it will not participate, citing economic and national security concerns.

the COP30 climate summit without even being there \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration does not intend to send a high-level delegation to the  COP30 climate summit  — or possibly any delegation at all. But that doesn’t mean the country’s influence won’t be felt at the talks.\n \n\n   \n  As nations prepare to gather in Belém, Brazil, for the negotiations, which begin on Thursday with the leaders summit, the US is set to play the part of the elephant in the room. Even operating from afar, the US could have the power to blow up a deal in Belém. The Trump administration has recently taken aggressive stances to try to influence other countries’ climate policies, mainly by threatening hostile trade measures.\n \n\n   \n  The US   has estranged itself   from official international climate negotiation processes while simultaneously exerting pressure on trading partners to water down or reject climate commitments. This paradox could have an impact on COP30, experts tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It is not known whether the US will simply ignore COP or try to intervene to secure preferred outcomes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has publicly criticized the COP process and stated it does not plan to participate. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesman Taylor Rogers told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The US will not send any high-level representatives to COP30, Rogers said. “The President is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This practice of linking trade and climate so closely is an innovation of the Trump administration, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University who worked on US climate negotiations with China for the Obama administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of US leadership, she said that China, which is the world’s top emitter, may seek to assume more of a prominent, steering role at the talks. The European Union is also likely to take a strong role, though internal rifts have emerged within the EU regarding how aggressively to cut its own emissions.\n \n\n   \n    Weakening resolve\n \n\n   \n  Other countries have not followed the US out of the Paris Agreement, but the abrupt shifts in policy in Washington have affected the global mood. An administration that now heavily favors fossil fuels over renewables has reduced the incentives for other countries to submit ambitious plans for cutting emissions through 2035, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  These plans were supposed to be delivered by virtually every country in the world in the run up to COP30. However, only about 60 countries delivered theirs to the UN on time, and the actions they outline fall far short of achieving the temperature targets contained in the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s an undeniable fact, which is that with the US withdrawal for a second time, it’s definitely seeming to undermine ambition,” Gallagher said. “I think it’s just getting harder to make the case that global ambition is going to rise without pretty substantial engagement from the United States,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And now, instead of constructive engagement or simply disengagement, America has demonstrated a trend toward behavior that undermines aggressive climate goals. This was the case last month at a  meeting of the International Maritime Organization  (IMO), which regulates pollution from the international shipping fleet, where US diplomats acted in concert with major oil-producing nations to scuttle what would have been the world’s first carbon tax.\n \n\n   \n  The long-heralded proposal would have imposed a tax on carbon pollution from global shipping to encourage a switch to cleaner-burning fuels. Officials in Washington — including President Donald Trump who  released a scathing Truth Social post  — were involved in turning up the pressure on diplomats at that meeting. The US threatened to retaliate via trade measures against countries who voted in favor. Neither Gallagher nor other experts expect similarly disruptive behavior from the US during COP30, but they couldn’t rule it out, either.\n \n\n   \n  However, Kaveh Guilanpour of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, for one, thinks any US intervention would be less effective at COP30 than it was at the shipping meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “The rest of the world continues to be committed to the Paris Agreement. Countries realize that it is ultimately in their long-term interest that the Paris Agreement succeeds,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation [with the global carbon tax] is very different from that of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “There was a very specific normative proposal under the IMO that the US pushed back against. Negotiations under the Paris Agreement, on the other hand, are largely over. It is now about implementing promises already made.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite those differences, the IMO episode is an example of the US prioritizing its own trade interests over global interests to cut planet-warming pollution. Gallagher said it’s possible that the Trump administration will again seek to disrupt negotiations, from the sidelines of COP30. Only this time, the point of contention would likely be climate finance :  Funding climate adaptation and renewable energy in the developing world is a big topic at COP30.\n \n\n   \n  America’s options for swaying the negotiations themselves, however, are ironically limited, she said, because of the Paris withdrawal and lack of attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s very little that the Trump administration could do in Brazil,” Gallagher said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/baseball-salary-cap-2027","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"After Dodgers’ win, a salary cap is looming large over baseball.

Here’s why that might be a bad idea \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It may be easy to look at the Los Angeles Dodgers’ record-setting payroll and back-to-back World Series titles and think that baseball desperately   needs a salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  After all, the Dodgers’ total payroll of $350 million is roughly double the league’s average and $84 million more than the previous record for a series champ, which was set by the Dodgers themselves just one year earlier.   \n \n\n   \n  And there are indications team owners will be pushing for a cap in labor negotiations a year from now when the labor deal between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the labor union representing nearly 8,000 players in the majors and minors.\n \n\n   \n  “No one argues that the Kansas City Chiefs are ruining football by dominating the sport because the Chiefs didn’t buy their way to a championship, and it’s perceived that the Dodgers did,” said Victor Matheson, economics professor and expert in the business of sports at the College of the Holy Cross. “And, of course, it’s perceived that the Dodgers did so because they (spend) about $100 million more on batters and pitchers in their lineup than the (runner-up Toronto Blue) Jays did.”\n \n\n   \n  But the facts don’t back up the idea that money is everything in baseball, or that a salary cap would solve the Dodgers’ dominance. Because despite the Dodgers’ recent success and deep pockets, there is greater competition within the sport than it appears.\n \n\n   \n    Dollars don’t equal wins\n \n\n   \n  Had the Blue Jays pulled off the victory over the Dodgers on Saturday, it would have given baseball its 10th different champion in the last 12 years, a period during which the NFL, with its salary cap, has had only six different teams win the Super Bowl, and the NBA, with its cap, had eight champions.\n \n\n   \n  But in baseball, only about 10% of the difference between good teams and bad teams is due to the size of their payroll, said Matheson.\n \n\n   \n  “But there are so many things that you can’t control, like injuries and like, ‘Is that great player going to perform well at a key moment?’” Matheson said.\n \n\n   \n  Some other estimates, such as one from Andrew Zimbalist, economics professor emeritus at Smith College and a leading expert on the business of sports, put the impact of payroll higher, but still only about 25% of the difference between winning and losing.\n \n\n   \n  The team with the second-largest payroll in the sport, the New York Mets, were beat to the postseason by the small-market Cincinnati Reds, who were 19th on the payroll list.   \n \n\n   \n  The team with the best regular season record was not the deep-pocketed Dodgers but the Milwaukee Brewers, with a payroll of about a third of the Dodgers’ and No. 18 of the 30 MLB teams.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the Brewers were eventually swept by the Dodgers in the playoffs. But anything can happen in baseball’s postseason format, even when one team is considered vastly superior to another.\n \n\n   \n  “Largely what happens in the postseason is a product of randomness,” said Zimbalist. “It’s a product of which team is peaking at the right moment, which team gets better breaks, better luck at the right moment.”\n \n\n   \n  A pair of stellar plays in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series by two of the Dodgers’ lower-paid players — Miguel Rojas, who hit the game-tying home run, and Andy Pages, who made an extremely difficult catch to prevent the Blue Jays from scoring the winning run — were all that stood in the way of Toronto winning a title.\n \n\n   \n    The possibility of a lost season\n \n\n   \n  Efforts to bring about a salary cap to MLB might lead to something quite serious: a lost season — or more.\n \n\n   \n  The MLBPA has made opposition to a salary cap the hill to die on and has refused to agree to any deal that includes one. And the union doesn’t appear willing to change that stance.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate through the media, but I will tell you this: The issues that we see in the system we know can be addressed without (a salary cap),” union executive director Tony Clark said in a press conference on October 24.\n \n\n   \n  But the talk in the sport for well over a year is that the owners are more united than in the past in wanting a salary cap and are ready to go to extremes to get one.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers’ win could very well increase the chance of a work stoppage that wipes out much, if not all, of the 2027 season, said Zimbalist.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, yes, (the Dodgers’ win) will raise the stakes a little bit, and make the compromise a little bit harder to achieve,” he said. “Some owners have told me they think that it’ll take a year and a half of a lockout before the players accept the salary cap.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/uk/england-train-stabbing-driver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:10:00-05:00","title":"‘Heroic’ actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A stabbing attack occurred on a high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train traveling from Peterborough to London on Saturday evening.

   \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There were just 11 minutes between the moment British police received an emergency call about a  stabbing on a train  heading to London and the moment the suspect was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Eleven victims were hospitalized in the attack, including one railway worker who is in critical but stable condition, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have said the casualties would have been far worse if not for the actions of the “heroic” railway worker who tried to stop the attacker on the train and the driver who arranged for the train to be diverted to a nearby station.\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train, which was taking passengers from northern England to the British capital on Saturday evening, had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. The first emergency call to Cambridgeshire police was at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time. By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train worker, who was critically injured after confronting the attacker, has been named as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for LNER for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “In a moment of crisis, Sam did not hesitate as he stepped forward to protect those around him,” LNER managing director David Horne said. “His actions were incredibly brave, and we are so proud of him, and of all our colleagues who acted with such courage that evening.”\n \n\n   \n  His family added in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday paid tribute to him saying he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Five other casualties have now been discharged from hospital, BTP said in an update on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, served in the Royal Navy for 17 years, according to LNER.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related. Mahmood said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Cambridgeshire police are investigating whether three more knife incidents that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning are linked to the attacker. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses describe running from attack\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  At first she thought it was a Halloween prank, but it became clear it was a genuine attack when the man shouted that someone had a knife and more people came running down the train.\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses. Other passengers were able to hide themselves in the train’s buffet carriage.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness, Thomas McLachlan, told the BBC: “There were definitely many heroes on that day, many kind people who just wanted to help those around them – people handing out blankets, hand warmers.”\n \n\n   \n  McLachlan said he saw one injured man who had been slashed in the face. He and another witness told local media that he heard the man had been “trying to protect a young girl from being attacked” when he was stabbed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Sophie Tanno and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/markets/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s undeniable stock market victory that no one saw coming","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"One year after Donald Trump’s reelection, the U.S. stock market, particularly the S&P 500, has surged 19.6% over the past 12 months, driven by strong corporate earnings and investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.

November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year after President Donald Trump’s reelection, the US stock market continues to notch  record highs .\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors’ enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.\n \n\n   \n  To Trump, the market’s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 27 touted stocks’ record highs while speaking to a crowd with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Their stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,” Trump  said . “That means we’re doing something right.”\n \n\n   \n  But some analysts say the stock market’s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.\n \n\n   \n    Ascent to all-time highs\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the market’s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump’s “pretty aggressive changes and approaches” to tariffs and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump’s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,” Ellerbroek said. “The market hates uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  Investors have turned their attention to corporate America’s profits and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Technology has made that easier to do, he said, because “this AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things.”\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia ( NVDA ), which just hit $5 trillion in market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500’s market value.\n \n\n   \n  An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index’s 19.6% gain.\n \n\n   \n    Weathering tariff turmoil\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out his plan for tariffs. But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks may be higher in part because the administration’s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,” said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. “Were it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.”\n \n\n   \n  The Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and attacks on the Fed’s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.\n \n\n   \n  The 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in an interview in October.\n \n\n   \n  “What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market … you’ve got to respect the market,” Bessent said.\n \n\n   \n    Taking the baton\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was reelected, investors cheered the potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market’s ascent.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately you zoom back and you say, ‘All right, it’s an AI bull market,’” Mayfield said. “The administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.”\n \n\n   \n  From Trump’s election through the end of October, the S&P 500’s rise was the eighth best for a president’s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden’s term, marking the best performance on record.\n \n\n   \n  And the US stock market’s gains pale in comparison to global markets.

      \n  By Chelsea Bailey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a  terrorist attack  in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.\n \n\n   \n  But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.\n \n\n   \n  Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about how the investigation unfolded:\n \n\n   \n    A cryptic reference to Paris prompts suspicion\n \n\n   \n  According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.\n \n\n   \n  In June, agents allegedly tracked the man’s phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali’s home there, where he stayed for two nights.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.\n \n\n   \n  During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  A review of co-conspirator 1’s cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1’s phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari’ and ALI’s phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.’”\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.’”\n \n\n   \n  “Knowing Athari, it’s (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in  November 2015 . More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.\n \n\n   \n  After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n    Talk turned to action with purchase of firearms, complaint alleges\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.\n \n\n   \n  On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.\n \n\n   \n    FBI tailed trio as they allegedly scouted locations\n \n\n   \n  Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.\n \n\n   \n  “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.\n \n\n   \n  Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”\n \n\n   \n    References to ‘pumpkin’ trigger arrest on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n  In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”\n \n\n   \n  “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents  speculated  whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city’s large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Court process begins with hearing\n \n\n   \n  Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holly Yan, Jeff Winter and Leigh Waldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/style/amaarae-music-black-star-album","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00+00:00","title":"Rising 'Black Star' singer Amaarae takes center stage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amaarae, a Ghanaian-American singer, is at the peak of her rise in the global music scene.

stage \n       \n  By Leah Dolan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There are three things Amaarae can’t tour without — and no, it isn’t coke, ketamine and molly, despite what her song “Starkilla” suggests. Think more along the lines of a sauna, daily stretch routine and a bathroom floor so clean she could eat off of it. “Because I’m a huge germaphobe,” she said over the phone from her home in LA. “The slightest thing will put me off, and if I can’t shower because the bathroom is not clean, bro, my whole day is ruined.”\n \n\n   \n  These mindful measures are key, since, in reality, Amaarae is a self-described homebody. But listen to her new album “Black Star,” which she’s promoting with a tour across New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles and Toronto, and you wouldn’t know. Between lyrics about sex, drugs and spiking drinks, the Ghanaian-American’s public persona is built on being in the club. But the moment she is away from her natural habitat, “it just starts to mess with my mind.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, the rising star may be on the cusp of something big.\n \n\n   \n  Following her critically acclaimed sophomore album, “Fountain Baby” (2023), “Black Star” was breathlessly reviewed across the music press in August, with Rolling Stone calling it a “masterclass in controlled hedonism.”   In the last two years, she has toured with Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of Donald Glover, Kaytranada, and was personally requested by Sabrina Carpenter to open her viral Short N’ Sweet tour in September 2024. This summer she performed at Glastonbury, the UK’s largest music festival, for the first time, and made her Jimmy Kimmel Live debut earlier this fall. It was also the year Amaarae became the first solo Ghanaian female act to perform at Coachella — a lifelong dream, according to the artist. “It’s one thing to dream of something, then it’s another to be forever etched in history as the first person to achieve it from your country,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Born Ama Serwah Genfi, Amaarae grew up between New Jersey, Georgia and Ghana’s capital Accra. And while each of her hometowns has shaped her music in some way, it’s her West African roots that informed this record. Blending influences from bacardi, a form of South African dance music, and the fast percussion of the French Caribbean zouk scene with “ghetto tech” (a Detroit-style electronic mash-up of house, techno, bass and hiphop), Amaarae is recontextualizing African music, making it pop with high-pitch vocals, samples from Cher, and a guest feature from Naomi Campbell. And if you aren’t sonically adept enough to pick up on all this, the message is explicit in her album cover — the bold tricolor Ghanaian flag remade with Amaarae, dressed in a latex catsuit, as its black star.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a sartorial vibe she intends to bring with her on-stage. “I think about how I want the show to feel. I want it to be really gritty, dirty drums, dirty guitars, just lots of bass. So when I think about clothes, I think about leather, latex. I think about having on dark shades. I think about skirts, mini skirts. I love boots,” she said. “That’s what it feels like to me, just holding that energy of what it means to just be f***ing black, head to toe.”\n \n\n   \n  She opened her performance in New York wearing a sports jacket by  Martine Rose  and a tulle skirt by Simone Rocha — two cult favorite British designers only the truly fashion-forward would know of. When asked about designers she’d like to work with today, she nodded to Haider Ackermann’s recent collection for Tom Ford at  Paris Fashion Week last month.  “I think that was definitely the show of the year,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Breaking the pop star mold\n \n\n   \n  While some may struggle to define Amaarae’s genre-bending music, she knows exactly who she is. “To me, I’m a pop star,” she said, though she is keenly aware that those higher up in the industry might not “put me in that category.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me choose my words carefully, because I was about to say something crazy,” she continued. “I think the term of what a pop star is has changed completely, and is almost exclusively reserved for White girls.” Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Queen Latifah — these were the pop stars of her generation, at least to Amaarae. “We just don’t live in that world anymore,” she said. “Music is so fragmented now. There was a time where hip hop, alternative, RnB were all co-existing in one cauldron, and you were seeing collaborations directly with these artists.” It’s a complaint that has long plagued the pop genre. In 2021, the Filipino-American artist and the three-time Grammy Award winner Olivia Rodrigo made headlines when she told an interviewer she grew up believing pop stars could only be White. Normani voiced similar issues in a Harper’s Bazaar cover story in 2019, where she asked why pop music “had to be so White?”\n \n\n   \n  To qualify now, in Amaarae’s eyes, stars must be “broadly appealing, but also a kick ass performer,” as well as having enviable musical ability. “It’s just not entirely based on talent,” she said. Besides herself, is there anyone she can think of that is deserving of this ever elusive label? “One of my recent favorite pop stars is Doechii,” she said. “Because she checks all those boxes and I respect that. I can see the effort and the work that has gone on over the various years.”\n \n\n   \n  The job description has changed, too. Amaarae is clearly nostalgic for a pre-social media past that seemed to allow artists more creative freedom. She is no longer on the social media site X, after a poorly received Ozempic joke she posted got her called “all types of stupid” by people online. The internet, she said, is “out for blood.” The musician also resents the idea that “artists have to become content creators.” Her peers feel the same: Halsey, FKA Twigs, Florence Welch and Charli XCX have all spoken publicly about record labels pressuring musicians for viral TikToks since the app reached  mainstream popularity during the pandemic . “It’s unfortunate,” lamented Amaarae, who thinks this type of overexposure “is the reason why we don’t have mega stars the way that we used to.”\n \n\n   \n  For her current tour, she is eliminating the noise and putting herself center stage, with no backing dancers and no on-screen visuals. The show is just her. “I’m holding up the entire performance,” she said. “I’m really excited about that. It’s never just been me, lights and music.” To her, the experience is freeing. “This is my favorite kind of performance.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/dick-cheney-death-obit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:54:00-05:00","title":"Dick Cheney, influential Republican vice president to George W.

Bush, dies \n       \n  By Stephen Collinson, Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:54 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dick Cheney, America’s most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.\n \n\n   \n  “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n \n\n   \n  The 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player. In his final years, however, Cheney, still a hardline conservative, nevertheless became largely ostracized from his party over his intense  criticism of President Donald Trump  whom he branded a “coward”   and the greatest-ever threat to the republic.\n \n\n   \n  In an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president’s club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a  heart transplant in 2012  that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  While caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush’s inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was in the White House, with the president out of town on the crisp, clear morning of September 11, 2001. In the split second of horror when a second hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center in New York, he said he became a changed man, determined to avenge the al Qaeda-orchestrated attacks and to enforce US power throughout the Middle East with a neo-conservative doctrine of regime change and pre-emptive war.\n \n\n   \n  “At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN’s John King in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.\n \n\n   \n  Contemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “ The Decider .”\n \n\n   \n    A changed man\n \n\n   \n  From a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.\n \n\n   \n  The September 11 attacks unleashed the US war in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, which was harboring al Qaeda, though the terror group’s leader Osama bin Laden escaped. Soon, Cheney was agitating for widening the US assault to Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, whose forces he had helped to eject from Kuwait in the first Gulf War as President George H.W. Bush’s Pentagon chief.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s aggressive warnings about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney’s most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time. While admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”\n \n\n   \n  The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable.   Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.\n \n\n   \n    No regrets\n \n\n   \n  Cheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  To the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 2,800 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.\n \n\n   \n  “I would do it again in a minute,”  Cheney said , when confronted by a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 that  concluded  enhanced interrogation methods as brutal and ineffective and responsible for damaging US standing in the eyes of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Of the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘He’s a coward’\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president’s first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.\n \n\n   \n  The former vice president’s daughter, then-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, sacrificed a promising career in the GOP to oppose Trump after his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. In an  ad for his daughter’s unsuccessful campaign  to fight off a pro-Trump candidate’s primary challenge in 2022, Dick Cheney – who was, by then, rarely seen in public – looked directly into the camera from under a wide brimmed cowboy hat and delivered an extraordinary direct message.\n \n\n   \n  “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\n \n\n   \n    Early days out West\n \n\n   \n  Richard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was  accepted  to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission,  he was kicked out .\n \n\n   \n  He returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn’t interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told  The New Yorker . “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney went back to school and earned a bachelor’s and master’s in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n    A veteran Washington power broker\n \n\n   \n  Cheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  He was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon. The pair formed an extraordinary backroom alliance in the Bush administration throughout the war on terror and the Iraq war – much to the frustration of more moderate members of the administration including then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice – who took over from Powell in the second term.\n \n\n   \n  While Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming’s sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a  very conservative voting record .\n \n\n   \n  In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq’s troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.\n \n\n   \n  During Democrat Bill Clinton’s presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.\n \n\n   \n  It wouldn’t be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate’s search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.\n \n\n   \n  “During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bush’s presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration’s energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush’s first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  He was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary’s sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to  The Washington Post . “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.\n \n\n   \n  His relationship with Bush was complicated in later years, including by Bush’s refusal to pardon Cheney’s chief of staff Scooter Libby, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 after a probe into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally  shot a hunting partner  in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.\n \n\n   \n    Health issues\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney at the time said that he’d be the “the first to step down” if he learned he’d be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated. Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama’s inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.\n \n\n   \n  A year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.\n \n\n   \n    Life after the White House\n \n\n   \n  After leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.\n \n\n   \n  Years later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership’s response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheney   on the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  In a remarkable moment,  Democrats lined up  to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  hugged Cheney . The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.\n \n\n   \n  It was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to  endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat and Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign. He said he would vote for Harris because of the “duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.” Cheney emphasized his disdain for Trump at the time and warned that he “can never be trusted with power again,” though Trump would go on to win the presidency a couple of months later.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jamie Gangel and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, politically motivated redistricting efforts have surged outside the typical decennial cycle, as both Democrats and Republicans engage in strategic map changes to influence outcomes in the 2026 midterm elections.

unprecedented redistricting efforts \n       \n  By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California voters will decide on Tuesday if they want to adopt a new congressional map — a move which Democratic leaders  hope will help their party  win five more seats.\n \n\n   \n  The map would be the first major response from Democrats against  unprecedented Republican efforts , led by President Donald Trump, to redraw congressional maps this year to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/shutdown-congress-tied-longest-bipartisan-talks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Congress ties record for longest shutdown as bipartisan talks pick up steam","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is tied for its longest government shutdown in history, now lasting 35 days, as bipartisan talks between Republicans and Democrats show fragile but growing momentum.

Yet it’s not yet clear whether this potential off-ramp will deliver Democrats any real win on their biggest demand of the shutdown: health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I do believe that we are finally making progress. It’s too soon to declare that this nightmare of a shutdown is over, but I’m very cautiously hopeful that it will be resolved by the end of this week,” Sen. Susan Collins, the Senate’s top GOP spending leader, told CNN. The Maine Republican has been involved in a flurry of conversations in recent days to end the impasse by funding both parties’ priorities in bipartisan year-long funding bills.\n \n\n   \n  There’s still a long way to go. Party leaders are still not talking. The Senate is about to fail its 14th vote on the GOP’s stopgap plan to reopen the government. And neither side expects tangible progress on Election Day with key races from New Jersey to California on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune is not yet certain the end is in sight. He said Monday he is “optimistic” but not necessarily “confident” bipartisan senators will reach a deal to fund the government by week’s end.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on sort of my gut of how things operate, I think we’re getting close to an off ramp,” Thune said, but he cautioned: “This is unlike any other government shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune also acknowledged Monday that the Senate will likely have to draft a new stopgap bill — replacing the House’s version that goes through November 21 — in order to buy Congress more time to pass those full-year spending bills. Democrats see this as an opening to support something other than the same GOP funding plan, and to have input on the new version. (One person involved in the discussions said the likely end date for the new bill would be January, though spending leaders like Collins want Congress to aim for around Christmas instead.)\n \n\n   \n  That semblance of movement comes as shutdown damage is quickly racking up. Already on day 35 of the shutdown,  food banks nationwide are swamped  with new families, furloughed workers are  applying for unemployment benefits  and air traffic is  snarling across the country .\n \n\n   \n  Collins and others involved in the talks have been mostly secretive about exactly who and what is involved. Leadership in both parties had for days largely downplayed the talks, though they are being kept up to speed by those involved, according to one person involved in the talks. For the first time, Collins said Democrats are now contributing to these appropriations talks, but there’s still a huge problem — it doesn’t solve the looming health care cliff next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if that’ll work or not. … This has nothing to do with health care, and that’s what my Democratic colleagues have harped on,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats will soon be faced with a key question: What will they accept from Republicans after their month-long push to extend expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies? Thune has publicly offered Democrats an up-or-down vote on those subsidies — but Democrats have said it is not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about her view, Sen. Elizabeth Warren stressed that Republicans need to sit down and negotiate and signaled that her party would not cave just because the shutdown effects were getting more painful.\n \n\n   \n  “He thinks he can use hungry children as a bargaining chip against Democrats, saying, in effect, that it’s only Democrats who care whether or not kids go hungry,” the Massachusetts Democrat said. “Well, it is Democrats who care, and it’s Americans who care. Republicans should come to the table and negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal Democratic debate comes at a delicate time for the party, with internal cracks already beginning to show over the momentum of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s mayoral election this week, which has bolstered progressives while ringing alarm bells for its more establishment wing.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered an  even starker  warning to Democrats in an op-ed over the weekend, warning the party not to cave to  President Donald Trump  on the shutdown: “This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Running out the clock’\n \n\n   \n  There’s one notable Republican absent in the discussions: Trump, who returned from a week abroad to find little had changed on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have largely steered clear of major visible involvement in the day-to-day dynamics of the shutdown, consulting frequently with Republican congressional leaders but letting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Thune dictate much of the party’s direction. Trump aides have sought instead to demonstrate that the administration is still pushing ahead on major priorities and policy announcements.\n \n\n   \n  Yet behind the scenes, officials have grown increasingly antsy as the shutdown drags on far longer than any of them expected.  Polling shows  Americans still placing significant blame on Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, complicating a messaging war that the White House initially anticipated it would decisively win.\n \n\n   \n  The health care rate hikes that Democrats initially shut down the government over more than a month ago are also now starting to hit consumers, further amplifying the issue at a moment in which voters are already unhappy with the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, officials have had running debates over the administration’s health care platform, consulting with GOP lawmakers and outside policy experts in preparation for post-shutdown talks with Democrats over the restoration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But those conversations have only progressed so far, stymied by the White House’s own hardline position against any negotiations during that shutdown. That stance, people involved in the discussions said, has made it difficult for the administration to counter Democrats’ attacks on health care, beyond offering vague assurances that officials are developing a health plan — a well-worn promise the GOP has failed to deliver on for nearly a decade.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s created a range of critical unknowns that under the current stalemate will go unanswered until the shutdown is over. Among them: what policies could win bipartisan support, the level of appetite on Capitol Hill for negotiating a broader health reform package, and what the health care landscape will look like whenever the shutdown is finally over.\n \n\n   \n  “We can come up with the policy in 30 seconds,” said one of the people involved in the discussions. “It’s just a question of what politically is going to be acceptable to the Republicans and what Democrats are going to think is enough of a fig leaf to move it forward.”\n \n\n   \n  “People see that there’s an issue that has to be fixed,” added GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “The speaker and Thune have both said this is something they want to address. The willingness is there,” Garbarino told CNN last week. “But the fact that nobody’s talking to each other right now, because they haven’t opened the government, it’s kind of running out the clock.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/china-nexperia-chip-exports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"04:02:00-05:00","title":"China backs off chip export ban that could have shut down global auto plants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China reversed its decision to ban exports of critical automotive chips from Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor company based in the Netherlands, to prevent widespread shutdowns of global auto plants.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has agreed to allow the export of chips critical to auto production, averting  widespread shutdowns  that had been predicted by the industry.\n \n\n   \n  The chips are provided by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. It’s a critical supplier for the global auto industry, providing 40% of the automotive chips in the market segment that includes transistors and diodes, according to research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  After the Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia several weeks ago and removed its Chinese CEO, citing national security concerns, Beijing suspended shipments from China. Auto industry trade groups in the United States and Europe both feared the trade dispute would lead them to run out of the chips they needed. That could drive up  car prices , as happened in the years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  After US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last week , Beijing said it would allow customers to apply for exemptions from a recently imposed export control and get the chips they need.\n \n\n   \n  “As a responsible major country, China fully considers the security and stability of domestic and international supply chains,” according to a statement on Saturday from China’s Ministry of Commerce. “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the companies and grant exemptions to eligible exports.”\n \n\n   \n  The  statement  also said that “the Dutch government’s inappropriate interference in the company’s internal affairs (had) led to the current chaos in the global supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate  statement  on Tuesday, the ministry claimed “the Dutch side continues to act unilaterally” and warned that this would “inevitably deepen the adverse effects on the global semiconductor supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  It said China was acting responsibly by announcing that it would exempt qualified exports and urged Dutch authorities to “act from the perspective of maintaining the overall stability and security” of trade relations between China and the Netherlands and China and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs told CNN: “We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia last month under pressure from the US government, which had placed its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, on a blacklist of companies it saw as posing a national security threat. In response to the Dutch action, the Chinese government ordered the export controls that stopped shipments of Nexperia chips for weeks.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Questions remain’\n \n\n   \n  A US-based auto industry   trade group hailed the Saturday announcement from Beijing and thanked Trump for the agreement with China that it said had averted the crisis. It called the agreement “obviously, a positive resolution to a potentially disruptive situation that should keep US and global automaking on track.”\n \n\n   \n  “Credit to President Trump and his team for insisting Nexperia was on the agenda during talks this week with China and for treating the global semiconductor supply chain as the economic and national security issue it so clearly is,” said John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the trade group representing most automakers operating in North America.\n \n\n   \n  But a European trade group said while China’s announcement over the weekend is good news for the industry, there are still concerns the crisis has not completely passed.\n \n\n   \n  “A number of practical questions remain as to how the exemption for export controls will be granted,” said a statement from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. “Until the secure flow of goods begins again, the situation will remain critical.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/trump-biden-economy-inflation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:42:00-05:00","title":"Trump Denies Inflation Is Hurting Americans.

It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:42 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “We have no inflation,” President Donald Trump said in his  “60 Minutes” interview  Sunday evening. “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n  And with  those two false claims , Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  Whether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.\n \n\n   \n  Inflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Grocery prices aren’t down, either – they’re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Denying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.\n \n\n   \n  A new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.\n \n\n   \n  Biden  polled miserably on the economy , too.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,” Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”  a claim that CNN later deemed false .\n \n\n   \n  Biden conceded that inflation is “the bane of our existence,” but downplayed it by saying it’s “mostly in food, and in gasoline.”\n \n\n   \n  That dismissiveness probably helped cost the Democrats the election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising – just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren’t exactly swayed by the Biden administration’s frequent statements that the  economy was on fire .\n \n\n   \n  “Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world and trending lower,” Biden  correctly said  during his 2024 State of the Union address. “It takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters didn’t buy it. Biden’s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tactics aren’t exactly  Biden’s . In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting “ greedflation ” and “shrinkflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is just straight-up doling out untruths – and  blaming Biden .\n \n\n   \n  But either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don’t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters’ lived experiences – especially when they’re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.\n \n\n   \n    Acknowledging reality\n \n\n   \n  Interestingly, Trump identified Biden’s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.\n \n\n   \n  The consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problems  quickly became Trump’s  But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN’s poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans aren’t just kvetching about high prices; they’re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they’re changing their behavior.  Chipotle, Coke, Crocs  and other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.\n \n\n   \n  Despite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans’ frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.  Loan defaults  and delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America’s most vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n    Inflation’s snowball effect\n \n\n   \n  The problem with inflation is that it’s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes – even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.\n \n\n   \n  Zooming out further, Moody’s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne﻿ed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don’t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are not interested in that story,” Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. “Their prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are, and that is why a large part of the public, if you sample people, inflation is still very much making people unhappy.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell noted it will take time – and growing paychecks – for the effect of higher prices to wear off.\n \n\n   \n  “It will feel better over time, but that will take time,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the lesson for Trump may have been best stated by Democratic political strategist David Plouffe.\n \n\n   \n  In “Original Sin,” the book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson into Biden’s late-term cognitive decline, Plouffe said the fatal mistake by Democrats  was to deny the reality voters were witnessing.\n \n\n   \n  “Never again can we as a party suggest to people that what they’re seeing is not true,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/sara-ellis-judge-greg-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Sara Ellis, Obama-Appointed Judge, Orders Federal Agents to Avoid Violent Encounters with Chicago Protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. federal judge Sara L.

ordered federal agents to avoid violent encounters with Chicago protesters? \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal judge in Illinois who ordered federal agents to limit aggressive tactics against protesters is known for her stern tone and an extensive career in civil and criminal litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have defended themselves in court as Judge Sara L. Ellis of the Northern District of Illinois has repeatedly pressed federal officials and demanded explanations for their response to intense protests in Chicago amid “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has   raised concerns a temporary restraining order she issued last month to block agents from using certain types of force against protesters was being violated. The courtroom felt like a principal’s office as Ellis detailed examples of incidents where she felt her order wasn’t being followed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not blind, right?” Ellis  said .\n \n\n   \n  While Ellis’ approach has been viewed by some as assertive oversight of executive powers, Ellis’ former colleagues who spoke with CNN described her as someone who dispenses evenhanded justice.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing last week, Ellis cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing tear gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis took on civil rights lawsuits and white-collar criminal defense for nearly 20 years before former President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench during his second term. The Canadian-born judge had previously discussed her experience as an immigrant to the US and indirectly addressed President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a US district judge, Ellis has taken on noteworthy cases ranging from Covid-19 restrictions to immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Judge Ellis calls the balls and strikes fairly in every case, applying the law without letting personal views play any role,” Corey Rubenstein, a Chicago attorney who has known Ellis for 25 years, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former colleague, William Ziegelmueller, said Ellis’ response “shows that she views herself as part of the community, not a resident of a lofty ivory tower, and understands that her rulings directly impact the lives of everyone in her community.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Having Sara on the other side was like going to war’\n \n\n   \n  Ellis received her bachelor’s degree in 1991 from Indiana University and her Juris Doctor in 1994 from Loyola University Chicago School of Law, according to  the Federal Judicial Center .\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming a judge, Ellis  practiced  almost exclusively in federal court as a litigator for criminal and civil matters, trying  11 cases  to verdict.\n \n\n   \n  After graduating from law school, Ellis began her career as a staff attorney at the Federal Defender Program in Chicago, according to the  district court . Ronald Safer, who met her when she was in that position, said she excelled as a young lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  “She is kind and gentle. Her demeanor led some people to underestimate her,” Safer told CNN. “They did so at their peril. Sara was a fierce advocate. She was a whip-smart legal analyst … Having Sara on the other side was like going to war.”\n \n\n   \n  She worked at a white-collar criminal defense law firm for four years before serving as assistant corporation counsel for the City of Chicago Department of Law, where she handled class claims for injunctive relief and civil rights lawsuits. Working for the city was like “living in the eye of the hurricane,” but Ellis “tried to bring order to chaos,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a defense lawyer, her compassion for her clients guided her every move,” said Rubenstein, who worked with Ellis at Stetler, Duffy and Rotert, Ltd.\n \n\n   \n  She also worked as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Chicago for several years. Before becoming a federal judge, Ellis worked at another Chicago law firm, where she handled criminal and civil cases.\n \n\n   \n  “She was admired and beloved by her colleagues and her clients,” said Safer, who worked with Ellis at Schiff Hardin LLP. One of her strong suits, he said, was she could talk to a jury as a peer.\n \n\n   \n  Her  pro bono work  included challenging solitary confinement for extended periods of time and advocating for the inclusion of female baseball players on high school baseball teams. She also volunteered to represent a Lake County, Illinois, man who Safer said had been wrongfully convicted.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Ellis has a distinguished record of pro bono work and community service,” Sen. Dick Durbin said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n  Rubenstein said Ellis “cares about the little guy, the downtrodden as much as any jurist I have known.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have been a zealous advocate for my clients’\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Durbin recommended Ellis and Judge Andrea Wood to Obama for judgeship positions, according to the district court. Obama then nominated Ellis on  May 6, 2013 , to a seat vacated by Joan B. Gottschall.\n \n\n   \n  “Sara Ellis and Andrea Wood are both experienced attorneys in federal court practice,” said former Chief Judge James Holderman in a  statement  following the nomination. “I have no doubt that they will be outstanding district judges on our court.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a Senate questionnaire, Ellis  said  her goal is “to adhere to the rule of law and apply the law in a fair and impartial manner.” She also said she aimed to treat “all litigants with courtesy, respect, and an even hand” and resolve legal issues “promptly, decisively, and after thorough application of the relevant legal principles to the facts at hand.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have been a zealous advocate for my clients regardless of their political beliefs, financial standing, or their role in the case as plaintiff or defendant,” Ellis wrote, adding she has represented members of law enforcement as well as criminal defendants.\n \n\n   \n  At her confirmation hearing, Ellis said she believes a judge should work “efficiently and expediently because justice delayed is justice denied.”\n \n\n   \n  The Senate confirmed Ellis by voice vote in October 2013.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I am an immigrant just like you’\n \n\n   \n  Born in Ontario, Canada, to Jamaican-born parents in 1969, Ellis became a US citizen at age 15, according to  Senate records . In 2017, Ellis  compared  her own swearing in as a new citizen to that of 117 United States citizens she swore in.\n \n\n   \n  “Thirty years ago, I took this very same oath. I am an immigrant just like you,” she said at the time. Ellis then asked a new citizen from Syria to lead the Pledge of Allegiance as the group rose and placed their hands over their hearts.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis remembered the “very hot, cramped immigration office” in Indianapolis as she stood next to her brother and sister. Giving her oath of allegiance to the US was an extremely powerful experience for her, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was moved by those words then, and I continue to be moved by those words 30 years later,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time,   Trump had issued an executive order banning travel from seven countries and all refugees from entry into the US. Although Ellis hadn’t mentioned Trump by name, her message had a clear target audience.\n \n\n   \n  “There are very negative things that have been said and negative opinions that have been voiced,” Ellis said at the ceremony. “I want you to know and believe in your heart that you are welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n    Ellis ‘dispenses justice with patience and firmness’\n \n\n   \n  As a judge, Ellis has ruled on a wide range of issues,   from public health to voter registration records.\n \n\n   \n  “What stands out about Judge Ellis as a judge is the kindness, compassion, and humanity that she routinely displays through her rulings and interactions with litigants,” Ziegelmueller said.\n \n\n   \n  Safer said Ellis “dispenses justice with patience and firmness. She decides.” He added Ellis was never on the  “Biden list, ” which refers to federal judges who have a significant number of case motions pending for long periods.\n \n\n   \n  “She controls her courtroom not by demanded obedience – although she will do so if necessary – but by commanding respect,” Safer said, adding she has an “iron will.”\n \n\n   \n  One notable case in 2020 involved a  lawsuit  by the Illinois Republican Party. Ellis denied a motion for an injunction against Gov. JB Pritzker’s executive order that placed gathering size restrictions on political parties, finding the state was not treating political parties differently from other similar groups.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, a case brought by Judicial Watch sought access to Illinois voter registration records and to remove allegedly ineligible voters. Ellis dismissed part of the case for lack of standing. The case is ongoing, with the only remaining claim alleging Illinois failed to make reasonable efforts to remove ineligible voters due to a change of residence.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, Ellis has served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency for US federal courts.

Bovino had been ordered to appear in court after plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has rebutted.   \n \n\n   \n  But the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday wiped away Ellis’ order mandating check-ins, saying she had overstepped her authority.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration argued Bovino having to appear before Ellis would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will go moving forward, but Safer says Ellis’ ruling “will be measured and it will be sound.” She will take the time to gather the facts and rule based on what is right under the law without dragging the case out, Safer expects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the federal government thinks they can trifle with her and her orders, it is because they brought in people from Washington who do not know her. If the plaintiffs think she will go outside the law to protect people just because her heart goes out to them, they will be disappointed,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Bovino thinks he is tougher than she is, he will find that he is sadly mistaken.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:39:00-05:00","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British man, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and one count of possession of a bladed article in connection with a mass stabbing that occurred on an LNER train traveling from Doncaster to London on November 1, 2025.

While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  He is further charged with one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article in connection to the mass stabbing in Cambridgeshire, according to BTP.\n \n\n   \n  The man is also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with a separate incident that happened earlier on Saturday at Pontoon Dock Station in London.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Cambridgeshire police are investigating whether three more knife incidents that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning are linked to the attacker. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  “Our investigation is also looking at other possible linked offences,” Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy of the British Transport Police said in a statement Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Sunday evening, one person remains in hospital in life-threatening condition, BTP said. The man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood paid tribute to the worker, saying that he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Monday that five people were still in the hospital, including the train crew member who is in a “critical but stable condition.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims still in the hospital is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/watch-to-watch-as-the-supreme-court-reviews-trumps-sweeping-global-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"What to watch as the Supreme Court reviews Trump’s sweeping global tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on whether President Donald Trump can impose sweeping emergency tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), focusing on the legal definition of 'regulate.'

At stake are tens of billions of dollars in revenue the administration has already collected and potentially trillions more – and the resolution of a power struggle that both sides have framed in existential terms.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some key points to watch as the nine justices take their seats to hear the case at 10 am ET.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do it?\n \n\n   \n  The blockbuster battle over tariffs will likely be decided based on how a majority of the court defines a single word: “regulate.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to levy the import duties. That law allows a president to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. The administration argues the word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, since tariffs are the most common way a government regulates imports.\n \n\n   \n  But the  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging  Trump note that the law – at no point – uses the words “tariffs” or “duties.” A far more logical reading of the law, they say, is that it allows a president to impose sanctions on other countries during emergencies. After all, they point out, Trump has  other laws at his disposal  that he could use to raise tariffs to deal with trade imbalances.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just that those other laws have limits and IEEPA, for the most part, does not.\n \n\n   \n  Lower courts have consistently sided against Trump in the two cases now before the Supreme Court, though they have spelled out different rationales and implications – something the Justice Department has pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  In one case, led by V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based wine and spirits company, a divided Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that IEEPA might permit some tariffs, just not the  widespread duties Trump has carried out . In another case, led by an educational toy company called Learning Resources, a federal district court in Washington, DC, ruled that the law likely didn’t grant the president power to impose the tariffs at all.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Joe Biden\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court was clear in  case  after  case  involving President Joe Biden that an administration cannot take certain actions without explicit authorization from Congress. That is particularly true, the court has  repeatedly ruled , when policies involve “major” political or economic questions.\n \n\n   \n  Two years ago, the court’s conservative majority relied on what’s known as the “major questions doctrine” to block  Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan . A year earlier, the court stopped Biden’s vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses challenging Trump say the same logic should apply to the tariffs. The law Trump is relying on, they point out, never uses the word “tariff.”\n \n\n   \n  How the conservative justices wrestle with that argument may tell observers everything they need to know about where the court is heading in this case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has offered the court a few arguments to bypass the doctrine that was repeatedly used against Biden. First, the administration says, those earlier cases involved agencies taking action – like the Department of Education when it came to student loan forgiveness. Second, Trump argues, the tariffs implicate foreign affairs, where a president has long been given a lot of leeway by the other branches.\n \n\n   \n  If key justices quickly distinguish the Biden-era cases on one of those grounds, that will be a good sign for the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Richard Nixon\n \n\n   \n  Trump is relying, at least in part, on a similar effort undertaken by President Richard Nixon more than five decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 1971, Nixon imposed a 10% tariff on all imports – which the administration later justified under the Trading with the Enemy Act, a precursor to IEEPA that was enacted during World War I. Notably, that law used identical language to give the president authority to “regulate” imports. And at the time, a federal appeals court approved those tariffs with the same language.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in Congress were clearly aware of that when they enacted IEEPA with that same language. And that, the Department of Justice has argued, “strongly indicates that both Congress and the public contemporaneously understood that language to encompass tariffs.”\n \n\n   \n  The businesses challenging Trump have balked at that logic. They agree that Congress kept the “regulate” language in place for emergencies but said that, in response to Nixon, Congress also passed a law with clear instructions for when a president could unilaterally impose tariffs to address a trade imbalance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump doesn’t want to use that law, however, because it imposes limits on tariffs – capping them at 15% and permitting them for only 150 days.\n \n\n   \n  How the court’s conservatives weigh that history could influence the outcome of the case, particularly if some signal that Trump’s actions have no historic precedent.\n \n\n   \n    Tariff or a tax?\n \n\n   \n  For years,  economists have shaken their heads  as the president and other White House officials have repeatedly described tariffs as a duty paid by foreign companies. The debate over how to depict the tariffs has taken on legal significance in the case before the Supreme Court, and how the justices deal with it could provide clues about their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging the tariffs  call them a tax, which they note falls squarely within the power of Congress under the Constitution to levy – not a president. Because tariffs are paid “primarily by American businesses,” and ultimately American consumers, the plaintiffs told the Supreme Court in written arguments, the president’s tariffs have “equated to the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps sensing the danger in that argument, the Department of Justice spent a significant portion of its most recent brief in late October distinguishing between tariffs and taxes.

John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney, blasted the plaintiffs for relying on a “repeated, false equivalence between domestic revenue-raising taxes and regulatory tariffs on foreign imports.”\n \n\n   \n  What Trump has imposed under IEEPA, Sauer said, are “regulatory tariffs” on foreign imports to “deal with foreign threats,” which he said, “crucially differ from domestic taxation.”\n \n\n   \n    Vassal States of America\n \n\n   \n  After floating the idea of attending the oral arguments in person on Wednesday, Trump said over the weekend  he would skip the session .\n \n\n   \n  Even though the president will be elsewhere, his heightened rhetoric is all over the case. The Justice Department has used unusually striking language to warn the justices about what might happen if the court ultimately rules against the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer has quoted administration officials framing a loss as a “catastrophic” and “ruinous” outcome that would lead to a “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.” Upholding the lower courts, the administration said, would “accelerate the drift toward America’s decline into a vassal state.”\n \n\n   \n  That language is clearly designed to give the justices pause about the practical implications of their decision, even though the court’s conservatives have long espoused the idea that they make decisions based on the law as they find it, not on potential consequences.\n \n\n   \n  It will be worth watching whether Sauer doubles down on that strategy as he looks up at the bench on Wednesday from the podium.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a dozen states that oppose the administration, criticized the Justice Department for its “hyperbolic rhetoric” and quoted from a  concurring opinion from three conservative justices  – Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – when the court tossed out Biden’s vaccine requirements.\n \n\n   \n  “The question, as in other recent cases of executive overreach, is: ‘Who decides?’” the states wrote. “Congress, not the president, decides whether and how much to tax Americans who import goods from abroad.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/northern-afghanistan-earthquake-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-11:00","title":"Deadly Quake Rocks Afghanistan, Leaving Iconic Blue Mosque Surrounded by Rubble","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan on November 4, 2025, near Mazar-i-Sharif, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 860.

Afghanistan leaving iconic Blue Mosque surrounded by rubble \n       \n  By Masoud Popalzai, Catherine Nicholls and Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:41 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A powerful earthquake has rattled northern Afghanistan, killing at least 20 people, injuring hundreds and damaging one the country’s most beautiful mosques.\n \n\n   \n  Families were jolted awake in the early hours of Monday when the 6.3-magnitude quake struck near Mazar-i-Sharif, one of the most populated cities in the north of the country, at a shallow depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles), the  United States Geological Survey  said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search and rescue operation is underway, with a child seen pulled alive from the rubble in the north of the country in video released by the Ministry of Defense on Monday morning. The girl was taken to hospital in a critical condition, a spokesperson for the 209 Al-Fath Army Corp told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mazar-i-Sharif’s iconic Blue Mosque was damaged in the quake, footage on social media geolocated by CNN revealed, with its base littered with rubble - early evidence of the destruction captured in the shadows before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  The site is one of Afghanistan’s architectural treasures and a major point of pilgrimage, believed by some to be the resting place of Hazrat Ali, the fourth Caliph of Islam and the son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in at least nine provinces, including Kabul, lost power after electricity lines from Uzbekistan – a major supplier of power to Afghanistan – were severed.\n \n\n   \n  The state-run energy company DABS also reported cut lines from Tajikistan to Kunduz province, plunging the area into total blackout. Teams are “working urgently to restore both routes,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Government officials put the death toll at 20. In an update early Tuesday, the World Health Organization said more than 860 people were injured in northern provinces of Balkh and Samangan — rising from more than 600 overnight. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority suggested casualties could rise further as “search and rescue operations are still ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Authority for Disaster Preparedness said the quake struck at around 1 a.m. local time, impacting parts of the north, east and west, with the epicenter located in Samangan.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations (UN) confirmed it has teams on the ground “to assess needs and deliver urgent aid.”\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments from a UN flyover on Monday found “fewer signs of damage than at first feared.”\n \n\n   \n  “We went over the main populated areas where the most settlements are in the earthquake affected area,” said Richard Trenchard, the UN’s acting Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, we saw very little widespread devastation… compared to the devastating scenes we saw in Kunar,” he said, referring the 6.0-magnitude quake that stuck eastern Afghanistan in August, killing at least 2,200 people.\n \n\n   \n  Afghanistan has endured a series of earthquake in recent years that have caused thousands of deaths and the USGS models estimate the shaking from Monday’s quake could result in hundreds of fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The impoverished country’s ability to respond to natural disasters has been further impeded by a shortage in international aid following the Taliban’s successful takeover in the wake of the  chaotic withdrawal of US-led forces  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to properties was reported in the affected areas, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority said, with accounts of broken windows and structural damage to homes.\n \n\n   \n  One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif told CNN that her family “woke up terrified” after the quake struck, saying that her children ran “down the stairs screaming” when it occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “I had never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life,” said Rahima, a former school teacher, 50, adding that it broke some of her windows and damaged the plaster on some of her walls.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that my house is made of concrete in the city,” she told CNN. “I don’t know if houses made of mud have survived this earthquake in the outskirts of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The quake also blocked the Tashqurghan passage, a critical route from the capital of Kabul towards neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but rescue teams have since cleared the route, the Ministry of Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  In Tashqurghan district, rubble and debris can be seen strewn across roads as bodies are carried away following the quake, according to footage from state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA). In another clip from RTA, people can be seen carefully making their way through the debris, scanning the ground with flashlights, with wrecked vehicles nearby.\n \n\n   \n  At least three hospitals in the quake zone were overwhelmed by the sudden influx of injured people, and “urgently” need “additional medical supplies, and emergency personnel to sustain life-saving services,” according to the World Health Organization.\n \n\n   \n  The earthquake was felt in regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, three countries that border northern Afghanistan, USGS reported.\n \n\n   \n  The region was hit by at least five aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.2 magnitude in the hours after the initial quake, according to USGS.\n \n\n   \n  India offered support following the earthquake, according to a post from foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on X. He wrote, “Indian relief material for the earthquake impacted communities is being handed over today. Further supplies of medicines to reach soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children, which has also deployed a team to the area, said while the scale of the destruction will take time to clarify, the impact on children’s mental health was immediate.\n \n\n   \n  “This is tragically the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit Afghanistan. As temperatures fall, thousands of children in the earthquake-devastated east of the country are facing the winter with only tents for protection from the rain and snow,” said Samira Sayed Rahman, the organization’s programme development and advocacy director for Afghanistan. “Now, families in the north are also experiencing fear and uncertainty after this latest powerful quake.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2023, another  6.3-magnitude earthquake  took place in western Afghanistan, killing more than 2,000.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:36:00-05:00","title":"French national and Nepali guides among three killed in avalanche on Nepal mountain, other foreign climbers missing","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal’s Rolwaling Valley killed at least three people, including a French national and two Nepali guides, while four foreign climbers from France, Canada, and Italy remain missing.

 \n  At least 16 people were climbing the 5,630-meter (18,471–foot) mountain when the avalanche struck base camp around 10:30 a.m. local time, Gyan Kumar Mahato, the Deputy Superintendent of Police in Nepal’s Dolakha district said.\n \n\n   \n  Among the three confirmed dead is a French national and two Nepali guides, Mahato said. Four people were rescued — two French and two Nepali nationals — and five Nepalis were able to make their own way back to base camp, located at 4,900 meters (16,070 feet).\n \n\n   \n  The nationalities and the identities of the foreign climbers still missing have not yet been confirmed, but Mahato said the group included climbers from France, Canada and Italy.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities had previously said seven people had died on the mountain before revising down the figure on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Weather has been deteriorating since last week in Nepal, with snowstorms reported on the mountains, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams launched an hours-long operation to reach the climbers but the weather conditions, high altitude and difficult terrain complicated their efforts. Rescuers were reaching the site on foot after a rescue helicopter attempted to reach the site, but bad weather forced it to turn back, AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a problem of oxygen also,” Mahato told CNN. “Only trained people who live in hilly, mountain area can conduct rescue operations. That’s why we are coordinating with local climbers and guides.

His opponents, meanwhile, have revamped their campaigns to try to cut into the front-runner’s support.\n \n\n   \n  Here are seven stories to get you up to speed on Tuesday’s election:\n \n\n   \n    First, Andrew Cuomo’s primary campaign collapsed\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo entered the mayoral race as the frontrunner despite sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied, that forced him to resign from office in 2021. But the former governor relied on name recognition and donor support instead of building out an extensive ground game, leading to his surprise loss in the June Democratic primary to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “Mamdani’s historic expansion of the electorate, his tapping into the hunger for a leftward lurch and fresh voice, defied almost every poll and expert’s expectation,”  CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reported . “But all but a few involved with the Cuomo campaign acknowledge, at least privately, how much they did wrong.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic socialists were emboldened and started talking primary challenges\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s surprise win emboldened the democratic socialists in New York City, who warned they were  considering primary challenges  against five incumbent House Democrats, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries’ team nicknamed the potential challengers “Team Gentrification.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani pivoted from anti-police rhetoric\n \n\n   \n  Part of Mamdani’s efforts to broaden his coalition has included  reaching out to police officers  and stepping away from his past calls to defund the police. The mayoral candidate met with off-duty police officers and held meetings on the proposals in his public safety agenda, which would overhaul the way the city approaches its most vulnerable residents.\n \n\n   \n    The Republican with many cats\n \n\n   \n  New York City hasn’t had a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg left office in 2013. But Republicans did not fully rally around their nominee:  Sliwa , a radio host, a founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, and a famous fan of fostering cats. Sliwa has campaigned by riding the subway and running on a tough-on-crime platform. He argued that his longtime ties to the city might help him reach voters who are otherwise opposed to Republican candidates. To the end, he refused to withdraw from the race despite pressure from Cuomo and others who wanted to consolidate the anti-Mamdani opposition.\n \n\n   \n  “When they come up to me, they don’t say, ‘Oh, the Republican,’” Sliwa told CNN. “They don’t see me as a politician. They see me as one of them, which is rare.”\n \n\n   \n    The diverse street at the center of the race\n \n\n   \n  Roosevelt Avenue, a diverse street in Queens that is also a hotspot for sex work,  became a focal point in the mayoral race  and debates over quality of life. Mamdani’s opponents criticized his support for decriminalizing sex work, pointing to it as evidence that he is soft on crime. Cuomo also hoped to use the issue to reach South Asian and Muslim voters. Mamdani has clarified that he doesn’t support legalizing sex work, but that he backs decriminalizing the practice between consenting adults.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling, who are currently being thrown in jail,” Mamdani said at a mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n    Many Jewish voters felt they had bad options\n \n\n   \n  For many Jewish New Yorkers, the New York City mayoral election has become emotionally fraught.  Some voters who spoke with CNN  said they were reluctant to support Mamdani due to his pro-Palestinian activism and criticisms of Israel’s government. Mamdani sought to reach out to Jewish New Yorkers, but the most recent pre-election polls still showed Cuomo drawing around 55% of the Jewish vote.\n \n\n   \n    A different kind of potential first lady\n \n\n   \n  Rama Duwaji, Mamdani’s 28-year-old artist wife,  carved her own path  ahead of potentially becoming New York City’s next first lady. She was not a high-profile surrogate for the campaign. Instead, her influence was felt behind the scenes and on social media, where she promoted her artwork focused on Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/starbucks-to-sell-control-of-china-business","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:08:00-05:00","title":"Starbucks to sell control of China business to Boyu Capital in $4 billion deal","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks is selling control of its China operations to investment firm Boyu Capital in a $4 billion deal, forming a joint venture where Boyu holds up to 60% ownership and Starbucks retains a 40% stake, continuing to license its brand and intellectual property.

What to know about the scandal rocking Israel \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a week ago, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the  Israeli  military’s top lawyer, tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the nation’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a  notorious Israeli military prison .\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding target of Israel’s right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi’s rapid fall has quickly emerged as a national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The affair dates back to July 2024, when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation and subsequent arrest of the soldiers fueled an intense political backlash, with some right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition even joining protests and riots outside the Sde Teiman facility and the military court where the soldiers were taken.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024, but it wasn’t the first report to raise concerns about conditions at the base. In May 2024, CNN spoke to  three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse  at Sde Teiman. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.\n \n\n   \n  But that did little to dull the vitriol targeting the military’s top lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Tomer-Yerushalmi was suspended from her role as military advocate-general, as Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav‑Miara announced a criminal investigation into the leak. Two days later, Tomer-Yerushalmi submitted her resignation letter, acknowledging that she approved the release of the video and taking “full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from within the unit.”\n \n\n   \n  She wrote in her letter that an “incitement campaign” against her had reached its peak following the decision to investigate soldiers at Sde Teiman. “This campaign continues to this very day and causes deep and serious harm to the IDF, to its image, and to the resilience of IDF soldiers and their commanders,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “There are things that cannot be done even against the worst of the detainees,” she wrote. “Officers of the (legal) unit have faced repeated personal attacks, harsh insults, and even real threats. All of this because they stood guard over the rule of law in the IDF – together with the commanders and alongside them.”\n \n\n   \n  For Israel’s right-wing political echelon, the resignation and investigation weren’t enough. Hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi stepped down, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he would take “all necessary sanctions against her,” including stripping her of her rank. Katz, who issued no fewer than seven statements against the chief military attorney in less than a week, accused her of involvement in a “blood libel” against the soldiers, even though the veracity of the video has not been questioned, and five soldiers were indicted in February 2025 for the abuse of the detainee. They have denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Worst PR disaster’ for Israel\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu called the leak “an enormous reputational blow,” describing it on Sunday as “the worst PR disaster in Israel’s history.”\n \n\n   \n  National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir dubbed the lawyer’s conduct “criminal behavior under a legal guise” and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the leak.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Tomer-Yerushalmi went missing.\n \n\n   \n  For several hours on Sunday, the Israeli military and police were unable to locate the woman who had, until just days earlier, been the top lawyer for the country’s armed forces. The IDF said in a statement that it would “employ all means available” to locate her “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  After an extensive search, she was found on a beach north of Tel Aviv.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday evening, police arrested Tomer-Yerushalmi on suspicion of multiple offenses: fraud and breach of trust, abuse of official power, obstruction of justice, and disclosure of information by a public official.\n \n\n   \n  She has not been formally charged yet or entered a plea. Her next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. A lawyer representing Tomer-Yerushalmi declined to comment on the case.\n \n\n   \n  Tomer-Yerushalmi is also suspected of allegedly misleading the High Court of Justice, and senior military and justice officials, about the leak of the footage and even submitting a false affidavit to the court. Alongside Tomer-Yerushalmi, other senior legal officials in the military prosecutor’s office are also implicated in the leak and its alleged cover-up. According to the police, there are five suspects in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Palestinian detainee at the center of the alleged abuse has been returned to Gaza as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, raising questions about the prospects of an effective prosecution of the soldiers accused in the case since the alleged victim is not available to testify.\n \n\n   \n  The affair has become a part of a larger attack on Israel’s judiciary from Netanyahu’s coalition.   Justice Minister Yariv Levin is attempting to bar Baharav-Miara – also a  frequent target  of the right wing – from probing the leak, suggesting the attorney general’s own involvement in the case should also be examined. “Anyone involved in conflicts of interest will not be part of the investigation,” Levin insisted in a statement last week.\n \n\n   \n  “The lies that have been built here over the years, while trampling on the rights of entire populations and severely harming the security of the state and IDF soldiers, are gradually falling apart,” said Levin. “One group that has gotten used to treating the country as its own is being replaced.”\n \n\n   \n  Baharav-Miara’s office responded in a letter, saying Levin was trying to “unlawfully interfere” with the investigative process, which “impedes its progress.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-cuomo-new-york-mayor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump urges New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo for mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump publicly endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 New York City mayoral race, urging New Yorkers to vote for him despite personal disagreements, and criticized Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani as a communist and unfit for office.

Andrew Cuomo in the city’s mayoral race on the eve of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,” the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday, adding that Cuomo “is capable of it” and that Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “is not!”\n \n\n   \n  His backing of Cuomo, whom he described as having a “Record of Success,” could hurt the former governor with Democrats as much as it helps him with Republicans in deep-blue New York City. Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, has repeatedly tied the former governor to Trump and argued that he would stand up to powerful interests in both New York and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo on Monday dismissed Trump’s endorsement, insisting that the president was simply opposing Mamdani. “He’s not endorsing me. He’s opposing Mamdani,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native, has long complained about Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, and falsely labeled him a communist. He again vowed to pull federal funds from the city if Mamdani wins Tuesday “other than the very minimum as required.”\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday night that the president is threatened by his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Like his (campaign), we’ve diagnosed the crisis in working class New Yorkers’ lives, the cost of living. But unlike him, we’re actually going to deliver on that. And that is a contrast that he can’t bear to see,” Mamdani said on “OutFront.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani had reacted to Trump’s backing of Cuomo earlier Monday at a canvas event in his Assembly district in Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him. Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  The president previously offered tepid support for Cuomo, casting the election as a choice between the better of two bad options, while discounting the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani quickly seized on Trump’s comments in that interview, posting his congratulations to Cuomo on X on Sunday and adding, “I know how hard you worked for this.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican president discouraged voters from backing Sliwa, though he’s stopped short of explicitly demanding the Republican nominee leave the race as other Cuomo backers have.\n \n\n   \n  “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys of likely voters have been  largely consistent i n showing Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, with Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally, also endorsed Cuomo on Monday over Mamdani and Sliwa. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he purchased in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has  a long history  with Trump dating back to his time as governor prior to his 2021 resignation facing sexual harassment allegations that he’s denied. The two tussled during the Covid-19 pandemic with often-dueling press briefings. But the former New York governor has presented his dealings with Trump as a plus for New York City, arguing that Mamdani is too inexperienced to handle the president.\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani retorted  during one debate . “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  The president — who’s holding telerallies for Virginia and New Jersey audiences Monday night — had his focus trained on the Empire State on social media, lashing out at Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who campaigned with Mamdani over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  He accused her of “killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL” and said he’d ask Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy “to take a good, long look at terminating New York City Congestion Pricing.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino, Aditi Sangal and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:15:00.000-05:00","title":"Millions of Americans Facing Delays in SNAP Food Assistance Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown in November 2025, the Trump administration has agreed to use emergency funds to partially fund SNAP benefits, allowing recipients to receive only half of their usual allotment.

But enrollees will only get half their usual allotment and will likely face  delays  in even receiving that assistance.\n \n\n   \n  Millions of SNAP recipients started missing their benefits on Saturday, and millions more could find themselves in the same situation over the course of the month, depending on when payments are made.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million people — or about 1 in 8 Americans — received food stamps in May, according to the latest USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  About 3 million people were set to receive their food stamps on November 1, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with governments of all levels to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. That figure will grow to about 13.7 million by November 5 and 26.6 million by November 10 if benefits aren’t distributed by then. The remaining enrollees are scheduled to receive their November benefits after that.\n \n\n   \n    Who relies on SNAP benefits for food assistance\n \n\n   \n  Overall, 12% of the US population relies on SNAP for food assistance. SNAP participation ranges widely across the United States, with the highest shares in New Mexico, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.\n \n\n   \n  Households with children, an elderly individual or a non-elderly person with a disability received 83% of SNAP benefits in fiscal year 2023, according to the USDA.\n \n\n   \n  Among recipients themselves, about 39% were children, while 20% were elderly and 10% were non-elderly individuals with a disability.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive about $350 a month, on average, in SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly three-quarters of the households that rely on the benefits to afford groceries have an income below 100% of the federal poverty level.\n \n\n   \n  The assistance doesn’t expire at the end of each month, but beneficiaries typically use all the funds in the month they receive them, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n \n\n   \n  Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good alternatives to food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Americans can turn to food pantries and other community food assistance programs, but these groups have been under pressure from rising food prices and increased need in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  “The shutdown adds another layer of strain to an already stretched emergency food system,” Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, the state association of food banks, said in a statement, noting that more than 3.5 million Texans receive food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Most states don’t have enough money to cover $8 billion in monthly food stamp benefits, though multiple states have said they will pour millions of dollars into their emergency food assistance programs in November.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"1200-04-11","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:11","title":"What to know about today’s key races, from NYC’s mayoral race to history in the making in Virginia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines key political races and issues in the U.S. during early 2025, with a focus on New York City’s mayoral race, New Jersey’s governorship, Virginia’s gubernatorial and attorney general races, and a critical vote on redistricting in California.

Andrew Cuomo, who is attempting a political comeback as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the  mayoral race  — one of a handful of contests around the country Tuesday that will draw copious attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When the sun comes up, everything changes — shadows lift off the river, light reflects off of office building windows, and you start to feel the warmth of a new day. That was how it felt when we beat Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani said Monday morning, referring to his Democratic primary win. “And it’s how we will feel again tomorrow when polls close at 9 p.m. (ET).”\n \n\n   \n  Though New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, the outcome could offer a window into what the party’s voters want from their leaders as a slew of competitive House and Senate primaries approach, and the 2028 presidential primary starts to take shape. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim immigrant and democratic socialist, has faced resistance and reticence within his own party, including from congressional leaders, over his  views about Israel . But his relentless focus on the cost of living and his viral social media videos have also shot him to stardom — making him a unique figure in a party desperate for new ways to counter President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Monday said Cuomo is “Trump’s puppet in this race,” after Trump on Sunday called Mamdani a communist and threatened to withhold federal dollars from the city. Trump on Monday urged New Yorkers in his strongest terms yet to  vote for Cuomo , writing on Truth Social that voters “really have no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  The race for governor across the Hudson River in New Jersey, another one in Virginia and a key redistricting vote in California will also serve to gauge how voters feel in the first year of Trump’s second presidency – and provide signals about the midterm elections just one year away.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the ongoing shutdown and Trump’s efforts to remake the government have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers who will play a central role Tuesday. In New Jersey, the  durability of Latino voters’ swing  to Trump in 2024, and the political potency of affordability concerns fueled by increasing taxes and utility costs, are at the center of a competitive contest.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas and a state Supreme Court retention vote in Pennsylvania cap an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are largely rallying around Cuomo, identifying him as the only hope of stopping Mamdani’s election despite Sliwa’s presence in the race. Trump said on “60 Minutes” Sunday that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time to be honest with you.”\n \n\n   \n  Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who served a short stint in Trump’s White House,  urged New Yorkers on X  on Monday to vote for Cuomo. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be a continued fight against Trump’s vision in Washington as he tries to stifle opportunity for people across this country,” Sherrill told supporters at a campaign office visit Monday.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday by CNN whether Trump is a liability in the governor’s race, Ciattarelli said, “Not one bit.”\n \n\n   \n  “The people of New Jersey know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day of the week,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  “What is it that we do here in Virginia?” Spanberger said at a Monday rally. “The answer is, we flip some seats. … The answer is that we stand up against the chaos and the division that we see coming out of this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races in Virginia four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana set to convene a special legislative session in the coming weeks to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/china/china-xi-laughing-images-apec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:48:00-05:00","title":"The White House has shared images of Xi Jinping that most Chinese don’t see at home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a stark contrast between the international image of Xi Jinping, as shown in White House images from the APEC summit in South Korea, where he appears relaxed and smiling during interactions with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, and the tightly controlled, serious image he projects domestically in China.

3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Xi Jinping is not known for his easy smiles. China’s most powerful Communist leader in decades has built a reputation reinforced by state media during his 12-year rule as a serious and steady hand.\n \n\n   \n  But images released by the White House show a different side of Xi – and one not apparent in images published at home.\n \n\n   \n   Xi attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) summit in South Korea, where he met US President Donald Trump for a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base in Busan.\n \n\n   \n  All eyes were on how the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies would sort out their differences on a range of topics from soybeans and fentanyl to rare earth minerals and high-end computer chips.\n \n\n   \n  But aside from the hard-hitting diplomacy, photographs released by the White House captured a rare candid moment between the two leaders.\n \n\n   \n  In a room filled with suited diplomats, Trump was seen in one image with his arm stretched across the negotiation table to show Xi a piece of paper. Whatever was written or printed on the paper remains unknown.\n \n\n   \n  In another image, the Chinese leader appears to grin with his eyes shut, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi laughing by his side. It’s unclear if the images were arranged in chronological order.\n \n\n   \n  Two days later, Xi was caught on camera cracking a joke when he exchanged gifts with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung, according to a Reuters video.\n \n\n   \n  Lee first presented Xi with a wooden board for the chess game Go. Then, the Chinese leader gave Lee and his wife two  China -made Xiaomi phones, which an official said came with displays made in South Korea, home to electronic giants Samsung and LG.\n \n\n   \n  Lee then jokingly asked: “How is the communication security?” drawing laughter from the room.\n \n\n   \n  Xi, who was also laughing at this point, replied: “You can check if there’s a backdoor.”\n \n\n   \n  A backdoor risk refers to a hidden method of accessing a user’s device without them knowing. The issue has prompted a raft of allegations between China and other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has recently expressed concerns over a US proposal to have advanced chips sold abroad fitted with tracking, a suggestion that prompted  US chipmaker Nvidia to say its chips had no “backdoors.”  Meanwhile, numerous Western countries have raised cybersecurity concerns regarding certain China-made devices.\n \n\n   \n  The two off-the-cuff moments from Xi contrast with his carefully crafted image at home, where he was recently shown  presiding over a military parade in a Mao suit , an outfit associated with Mao Zedong, Communist China’s founding father.\n \n\n   \n  Before his meeting with Trump, he chaired a party  plenum , delivering speeches in a stoic demonstration of his tight control over China’s political apparatus.\n \n\n   \n  Not all Chinese leaders projected such a tightly constructed image.\n \n\n   \n  Xi’s predecessor Jiang Zemin, who served as president between 1993 and 2003, was known for his flamboyant personality, cosmopolitan flair and willingness to show off his language skills and interact with journalists.\n \n\n   \n  However, Xi has charted a different course. Along with curbing freedom of expression in China, he has maintained strict control of his image and the flow of information. Elite politics has become so opaque under his rule that pundits look for any clue for China’s direction – from parsing Xi’s words for their real meaning to assessing the  color of his hair. \n \n\n   \n  Xi’s more relaxed international appearances in South Korea barely made it to China’s tightly controlled internet. Censors often remove any coverage of Xi that deviates from the official narrative in the country, where most Western news websites and social media platforms are banned.\n \n\n   \n  Footage and images showing Xi’s light-hearted exchanges with his US and South Korean counterparts were nowhere to be found on two of the country’s most popular social media platforms: Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, and Xiaohongshu.\n \n\n   \n  A few posts by Chinese-language news outlets based outside of China that reported Xi’s gift exchange with South Korea’s Lee were available on X-like platform Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  The posts only displayed a few users’ comments despite hundreds of messages. Among the reactions that survived, one user posted a thumbs up emoji and another left a smiling face.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/japan-expensive-rice-kinmemai-premium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:49:00-05:00","title":"From hunger to luxury: The story behind the world’s most expensive rice","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the story behind Kinmemai Premium, the world’s most expensive rice, which was certified by Guinness World Records in 2016.

      \n  By Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:49 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Holding an elegant black box embossed with the words “World’s Best Rice” in gold, Japanese chef Kenichi Fujimoto tilts his head and smiles — a flicker of skepticism on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “These things are often very commercial and not necessarily good,” says the Hong Kong-based chef/owner of Sushi Fujimoto, gesturing at the pot of rice simmering in his kitchen.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20 years of experience working under Michelin-starred sushi masters, the chef has encountered countless varieties of rice. Nothing like this, though.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do the makers of Kinmemai Premium claim that it’s the world’s best rice, but in 2016 Guinness World Records certified it as the  most expensive .\n \n\n   \n  Does it live up to the claim? CNN drafted in Fujimoto to help answer that question. The grains have been rinsed and soaked before they’re placed inside a cast-iron pot of water and heated.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an important test for a Japanese chef. “Rice is Japan’s soul food,” says Fujimoto. “For sushi, rice is the most important part — 80% of good sushi comes from the rice and 20% from the fish,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  The clock is now counting down to the moment of truth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll know in 15 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n    Only 1,000 boxes produced each year\n \n\n   \n  Rice has been a sacred staple in Japan for around 3,000 years.\n \n\n   \n  Today, there are more than 300 varieties commonly cultivated around the country, with new varieties constantly under development.\n \n\n   \n  Dishes and beverages made with Japanese rice — sushi, mochi cakes and sake — have gained international fame in recent decades. Rice exports, however, have never achieved the same levels of success.\n \n\n   \n  Enter Keiji Saika, the now 91-year-old president of Toyo Rice Corporation. In 2016, he decided to take promotion of the staple into his own hands.\n \n\n   \n  Based in Wakayama, his company sells rice milling machines as well as Kinmemai, directly translated as “Golden Sprout Rice”, a variety prized for its nutritional value and taste.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that Japan needed to better appeal to the international community about how great Japanese rice is,” Saika tells CNN Travel in an interview at the company’s Tokyo office.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge? Boost the global profile of Japanese rice without blowing the company’s marketing budget.\n \n\n   \n  “That was when the idea of Guinness World Records came to me. We’d have to do something that’s never been done before,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Confident that he had produced the world’s most delicious rice, Saika introduced Kinmemai Premium to the market that same year, selling it for a whopping 9,496 Japanese yen for a box of 840 grams — or about $109 per kilogram in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  “At a time when typical rice cost only 300 yen to 400 yen per kilogram, I wondered if anyone would actually buy it. Surprisingly, enquiries started increasing,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  What began as a one-off has since become an annual release, thanks to unrelenting demand. This year, boxes of Kinmemai Premium hit the market for 10,800 yen, or $73.4 apiece.\n \n\n   \n  With only 1,000 produced, they sold out quickly after their August 22 launch.\n \n\n   \n    Why doesn’t it make money?\n \n\n   \n  As Toyo Rice prepares to mark the project’s 10th anniversary in 2026, Saika emphasizes that profiting from the expensive rice was never his plan.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, when you calculate the costs, we’re probably running at a loss. Even though we sell it at a high price, it’s not profitable,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the initiative was meant to raise the profile of Japanese rice and encourage farmers to cultivate higher-quality strains. Saika calls it the “World’s Best Rice” project — one of many innovations driven by his determination to improve Japanese rice production.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1970s he developed rinse-free rice to conserve water. Two decades ago, his company created a new milling machine that removes only nine layers of bran instead of the usual 16, preserving nutrients and flavors.\n \n\n   \n  But to create Kinmemai Premium, the Guinness World Record version, the process is more complicated.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, Saika selects four to six top-class, award-winning rice varieties from a pool of about 5,000 entries. The International Contest on Rice Taste Evaluation, hosted by the Syokumi Kanteisi — The Rice Taste Appraiser Association — is the largest of its kind in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond flavor and texture, Saika tests the enzyme levels of each variety of rice.\n \n\n   \n  “That vitality, that life force, can be clearly identified through enzyme activity. Rice with strong vitality like that becomes truly exceptional,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Only the grains with the highest vitality are chosen. Then comes aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Letting the rice sit for a few months enhances the flavor even more. The taste becomes richer, and the health benefits seem to improve as well. So this rice is truly special,” Saika says.\n \n\n   \n  The painstaking process, combined with limited supply, makes Kinmemai Premium costly to produce. The rice is often given as a luxury gift, used to mark special occasions or impress corporate clients.\n \n\n   \n  Farmers chosen for the year’s  “World’s Best Rice” project are flown to Tokyo for the grand reveal.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone seems to take great pride in it,” says Saika. “This was an unexpected effect, but rice producers work hard toward that goal every year. As when they do that, it gets featured prominently in the local newspapers with a note that it’s been ‘selected as an ingredient for the World’s Best Rice.’”\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Kinmemai Premium features a blend of four rice varieties: there are two styles of Koshihikari Rice, from Gifu and Nagano prefectures, respectively, and two types of Yudai 21 Rice – also from Gifu and Nagano.\n \n\n   \n    Driven by hunger\n \n\n   \n  Saika’s devotion to rice is connected in his childhood. After World War II ended in 1945, Japan faced severe food shortages.\n \n\n   \n  The country was depending on the fall harvest to ease the crisis, but Typhoon Makurazaki hit Kagoshima, the southwestern tip of Japan, before moving north, devastating farmlands.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people died of starvation. Even judges — and those in important positions and the upper class,” Saika recalls.\n \n\n   \n  His family survived by planting whatever seeds they could find and catching eels, catfish and birds. This experience instilled in him a profound appreciation for rice and a mission to produce better grains.\n \n\n   \n  For him, Kinmemai Premium embodies that passion. But even he doesn’t have an unlimited supply.\n \n\n   \n  “(I eat it) just once a year when they ask me to taste that year’s rice. Just a little bit,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Hiroshi Matsumoto, head chef at the company’s in-house sushi restaurant, says he became an instant fan after trying the rice for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember it was so delicious that one bowl just wasn’t enough, and I found myself wanting a second one.” Still, he doesn’t serve it with sushi. “It’s best served warm, part of a set meal,” he says.\n \n\n   \n    Independent taste tests\n \n\n   \n  Back in Fujimoto’s kitchen the Kinmemai Premium — a gift from Toyo Rice — has been cooked and now sits steaming in the black, cast-iron pot.\n \n\n   \n  Usually, the chef would perform several test runs with a new rice to figure out the best soaking times, water levels and cooking temperatures. But with only 420 grams of Kinmemai Premium to play with, he’s had to improvise.\n \n\n   \n  Fujimoto rinsed the rice for a mere second and soaked it for 30 minutes — 30 minutes less than the recommended time — before adding it to the pot.\n \n\n   \n  His initial assessment? “Nice, clear color. I like it.” His wife Ai’s take? “Whoa. Shiny.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like a diamond,” adds Fujimoto. “You can see every grain standing out, which usually indicates good quality. The shape is beautiful, and the aroma is nicely balanced — not too strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tasting it, he gives his approval.\n \n\n   \n  “The flavor is well-balanced. The texture is good. It has nice moisture. This rice will appeal to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  Is he tempted to buy the rice for his restaurant?\n \n\n   \n  “No, no, no. It’s too expensive — we’d have to triple our prices,” he laughs.\n \n\n   \n  Like Toyo’s in-house chef, he also believes the rice is better served plain, more suited to a  kaiseki  restaurant, an establishment serving traditional refined dishes. “I think this rice isn’t really suited for sushi. It might get mushy if mixed with vinegar,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Chef Nansen Lai owns several Hong Kong restaurants including Flower Drum and Lai’s Kitchen – the latter of which specializes in clay pot rice. He also sampled the Kinmemai Premium, comparing it with his house blend — a mix of Thai fragrant rice and Koshihikari, another high-quality grain, from Japan’s Niigata prefecture.\n \n\n   \n  “It looks stickier and doesn’t have as strong a rice fragrance as Thai rice, which is a normal difference between Thai and Japanese rice,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  He takes a bite.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s delicious, with a much more complex taste and flavor than our house rice,” says Lai, before inviting his staff to try it.\n \n\n   \n  “From a restaurateur’s perspective, we can’t afford rice like this. We also need a firmer rice, like Thai rice, that can stand up to stronger sauces. But this rice is so tasty you could eat it plain.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Lai and Fujimoto agree that Toyo Rice’s project is a useful way to motivate producers.\n \n\n   \n  “Rice farmers are struggling. With costs like machines and gas prices rising, rice prices haven’t really changed much for the last 30 or 40 years. Japanese farmers didn’t enjoy the benefit of the raised retail prices. If they can’t make a living, young people will not continue the family business,” says Fujimoto.\n \n\n   \n    For a better future\n \n\n   \n  At 91, Saika remains vigorous, still going to work every day.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I’m wearing a suit, but usually I’m in work clothes, doing various tasks in the factory,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “There are quite a lot of elderly people who stay healthy. (Most) go to karaoke, play golf, or do exercises, but not many come to a company.”\n \n\n   \n  The secret to his health? Rice, of course. His passion for the staple drives him to keep working.\n \n\n   \n  “At this age, I care about the development of myself and the company, but my biggest concern is Japan’s future,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how many more years I’ll live, but during that time, I want to develop things that will be useful to society. I don’t have much time, so I’m busy every day.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/jake-haro-son-killing-trial-sentencing-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"21:37:00Z","title":"California father who killed his 7-month-old son sentenced to more than 30 years in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jake Haro, a 32-year-old father from Riverside, California, was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to the second-degree murder of his 7-month-old son, Emmanuel, and for assaulting another child in 2018.

to killing his missing 7-month-old son was sentenced Monday to more than 30 years in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Jake Haro, 32, was sentenced after he  pleaded  guilty last month to the second-degree  murder

that could end the shutdown \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s  Election Day 2025 . And the results in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere Tuesday could be some of the most significant dominoes to fall in the federal government shutdown, which is set to become the longest in history on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But the election isn’t the only X factor in the monthlong shutdown that’s evolving even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s check in on a number of key variables and sources of potential leverage in the shutdown and how they’re playing.\n \n\n   \n    Election Day 2025\n \n\n   \n  The big ones to watch here are the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  (The New York City mayor’s race and a redistricting ballot measure in California are fascinating for other reasons, but less instructive when it comes to Republican vs. Democrat power dynamics.)\n \n\n   \n  The blue lean of these two states and the history of these races suggest Democrats should win both gubernatorial races. Generally speaking, the party that just lost the presidential race  tends to overperform . This year, that’s Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win each race by comfortable margins — say by double digits — they’ll probably feel pretty good about how they’ve handled the shutdown. A good election night might leave them emboldened to press forward.\n \n\n   \n  That could especially be the case if Rep. Abigail Spanberger wins big in Virginia, given it’s home to so many government employees who are feeling the brunt of the shutdown. (The most recent polls suggest Spanberger leads, on average, by around 10 points.)\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans have been optimistic about making it a competitive race in New Jersey, which swung significantly in President Donald Trump’s direction in 2024. If Republican Jack Ciattarelli can keep it close with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Democrats might start second-guessing their shutdown strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans also appear to have real hope of winning the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race and especially the state’s attorney general’s race — though the latter owes mostly to the Democratic candidate’s  violent texts .\n \n\n   \n    Obamacare open enrollment\n \n\n   \n  This is the big source of potential leverage for Democrats. But it’s too early to say how it’s playing.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment for millions of people who get their health insurance  through the Obamacare marketplaces  began on Saturday. In other words, that’s when many people began to see their premiums would double next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies that would prevent those huge premium increases, in exchange for funding the government. And the optimistic case for them is that people seeing these premiums about to rise would ratchet up pressure on Republicans to give in.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republicans, including  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio , have warned the GOP about the political cost of not extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  We know that  north of 70% of Americans  have said they support extending the subsidies. The question for Republicans now is whether they think they might have to extend the subsidies either during or after the shutdown. If they start getting more pressure from their constituents, that could force them to act.\n \n\n   \n    SNAP benefits\n \n\n   \n  These food stamp benefits have been in limbo since Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration signaled Monday that it would  provide partial benefits  — $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund — after a federal judge ordered it to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  But notably, the administration declined to attempt to provide full benefits, which would cost roughly $9 billion for the month. And it made clear that it wasn’t going to strain too hard on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have been clear that they believe these benefits being withheld provides leverage in the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson last week told CNN’s Dana Bash that passing a bill to fully fund SNAP benefits would “reduce the pressure” on Democrats to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  So is he right?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps these benefits not being paid in full and on time does provide leverage — in the sense that no one wants to be blamed for Americans going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  But from a partisan standpoint, polls continue to show  more Americans blame Republicans than Democrats  for the shutdown. And the Republicans’ handling of SNAP in recent days could signal to Americans that it’s they who have stood in the way of a fully funded program.\n \n\n   \n  After all, Johnson was rejecting a push from some in his own party, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, to pass legislation.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday called the Trump administration’s partial SNAP funding “an intentional decision not to pay full benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the White House has also risked seeming tone-deaf on the financial pain of the shutdown in recent weeks. Not only has it set about demolishing the East Wing  for a ballroom  costing hundreds of millions of dollars (which Trump says is privately funded), but the president late last week proudly promoted a renovation of the  Lincoln Bedroom bathroom . And on Friday night, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort played host to  a “Great Gatsby”-themed event .\n \n\n   \n  Those are perhaps not the best optics.\n \n\n   \n    Paying the troops\n \n\n   \n  While the administration hasn’t bent over backward on SNAP benefits, it’s taken a more urgent posture toward military paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  For the second time, the administration on Friday  found funding  to make sure the military paychecks went out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made clear that he would like to be perceived as a political ally of the troops. He has repeatedly  attacked Democrats in speeches to the military  in recent weeks — a highly questionable breach of norms.\n \n\n   \n  “I want you to know that despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump told members of the Navy last month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have expressed warnings about Trump trying to wield the military for political purposes. And at some point, they might worry that enabling him to look like the savior of troops’ paychecks plays into his hands.\n \n\n   \n    Air travel\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps the biggest X factor right now. But it’s really difficult to evaluate the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n  This weekend marked the  worst one for air traffic control staffing shortages  since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis. And that notably came just days after Federal Aviation Administration employees  missed their first full paycheck .\n \n\n   \n  There have now been more than 400 staffing shortages, as of Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, meanwhile,  told CNBC  on Monday that he would “shut the whole airspace down” if he felt travel was unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that we are seeing significant slowdown in air travel probably plays somewhat like the SNAP issue — generally applying pressure on lawmakers to come to a resolution but not necessarily providing one side significantly more leverage than the other.\n \n\n   \n  The Thanksgiving travel season could up that pressure, however, as travel delays become more acute.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-nigeria-military-action-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-05:00","title":"Trump Reacts to Fox News Segment on Christian Persecution in Nigeria, Threatens Military Action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, after viewing a Fox News segment on Christian persecution in Nigeria, became immediately concerned and began publicly calling for U.S. military intervention.

Within an hour, he was laser-focused on Christians’ treatment in Nigeria \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was heading to Florida on Friday, watching Fox News, when he saw the network run a story on how Christians were being targeted by Islamic groups in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president was “immediately” angered by it, one of the sources said, and asked to get further read in on the issue. Shortly after Air Force One touched down in West Palm Beach, he began posting on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” he posted, adding that he is making Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the president has “been tracking this issue previously and had already begun thinking about Truthing it out.”\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plight of Christians in Nigeria became a focal point of Trump’s  throughout the weekend , leading him to call directly on his secretary of defense to “prepare for possible action” and warn the US would enter Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to protect the Christian population of Africa’s most populous country.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources familiar with Trump’s thinking on the issue told CNN that the president’s threats toward the country are meant to “see how Nigeria responds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an ‘Art of the Deal’”-type strategy, the source said. And a key part of it has already been met with the intended effect: The actions by Islamist groups are gaining attention thanks to his posts, they argued.\n \n\n   \n  “At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CNN. “Any announcements will come from the President directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The plight of Nigeria’s Christians has been an animating subject for American conservatives for years, with some of Trump’s top allies, including Sen. Ted Cruz, in recent months calling for US intervention after claiming Nigeria’s government wasn’t doing enough to prevent attacks on Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has denied the accusations, and both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s directive to the Pentagon to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria — including, in his telling, potential US boots on the ground — caught many by surprise, including in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Personnel within US Africa Command were abruptly recalled to headquarters over the weekend following Trump’s post on Saturday vowing potential military action in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The post left many wondering what the president wanted the military to do, the sources said. A small group of personnel with AFRICOM, which is based in Germany, were quickly recalled to discuss potential courses of action.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon was “preparing for action,” and one of the sources said there was a request from the Pentagon to build out various contingency plans.\n \n\n   \n  It remained unclear what the plans entail, though creating contingency plans for a range of scenarios to provide to the president and secretary of defense is one of the primary functions of the military.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump was elected in a landslide victory to accomplish his peace through strength agenda. The Department of War stands ready to execute the Commander in Chief’s direction,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The snap-to reaction on Saturday was indicative of a broader frustration with the way potential policy decisions are relayed over social media, one of the sources familiar said, with little planning done ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, declined to rule out sending American troops to Nigeria to protect Christians there.\n \n\n   \n  “Could be,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of US troops or airstrikes. “I envisage a lot of things. They’re killing a record number of Christians in Nigeria,” the president told reporters, saying other countries in Africa were doing similar.\n \n\n   \n    The reality on the ground\n \n\n   \n  While Trump claimed a “mass slaughter” of Christians was underway in Nigeria, there exists a  more nuanced reality  on the ground. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, experts and analysts say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to natural resources.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, Trump’s adviser on Arab and African affairs, told  Nigerian media  last month that “People of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Within US conservative circles, however, the situation in Nigeria has caused growing alarm. Trump himself raised the issue during a first-term meeting with then-President  Muhammadu Buhari  at the White House in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It’s a horrible story,” Trump said during a joint news conference afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Buhari said he had explained to Trump the security situation in Nigeria was more complicated than mere religious persecution, saying groups sometimes used religious violence as they pursued economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” two years later, citing “severe violations of religious freedom.” The Biden administration reversed the decision.\n \n\n   \n    Renewed effort by conservatives\n \n\n   \n  With Trump’s return to office came a renewed effort by American conservatives to apply pressure on the Nigerian government to stem violence against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who has earned overwhelming support from evangelical Christians during his campaigns for president, vowed during last year’s election to combat anti-Christian bias. And administration officials have stated previously that protecting Christians is a key tenet of Trump’s foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Paula White-Cain, the senior adviser to the White House faith office and Trump’s longtime spiritual adviser, has previously traveled to Nigeria to minister. She thanked Trump on social media this weekend for his “strong stand on Christian persecution in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, an evangelical Christian from Texas, is one of the GOP lawmakers who has been working to get his fellow Christians and Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedoms.\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill in September to sanction Nigerian officials whom he accused of “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians.” The measure would also require the State Department to redesignate Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” — something the president noted in his first post on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the issue was amplified on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO. Maher said Islamic militants in Nigeria were “attempting to wipe out the Christian population of an entire country.” HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.\n \n\n   \n  None of those calls seemed to go as far as Trump did, however, in threatening US military action on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How such an intervention is carried out remains to be seen. Last year, the US  completed a withdrawal  of some 1,000 US troops from Niger, which neighbors Nigeria, ending a longtime presence in the nation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nimi Princewill contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/north-korea-kim-yong-nam-death-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:38:00-05:00","title":"North Korea’s Longtime Ceremonial Head of State Kim Yong Nam Dies at 97","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kim Yong Nam, North Korea’s long-serving ceremonial head of state and a loyal bureaucrat, has died at 97, according to state media.

It said Kim Yong Nam’s funeral was set for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam is not related to Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong Un, grandson of state founder Kim Il Sung, took power upon his father Kim Jong Il’s death in 2011 in the country’s second hereditary power transfer.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People’s Assembly from 1998 to April 2019. That post is North Korea’s nominal head of state, though the true power was held by the Kim family that has ruled the North since its formal foundation in 1948.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam, who was known for propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice at key state events, often appeared in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  In February 2018, he traveled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics as Pyongyang sought better ties with Seoul and Washington after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  The trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since Kim Jong Un sent a top military officer to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pyeongchang opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-US Vice President Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s temporary diplomatic openness peaked with the summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, but Kim Yong Nam did not attend them and his influence was seen as waning due to his age. In April 2019, he was replaced by Choe Ryong Hae, one of Kim Jong Un’s close confidants who had previously served as the top political officer of the North’s 1.2 million-member military.\n \n\n   \n    Survivor of purges\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam’s career epitomized that of a successful North Korean bureaucrat.

He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. During his tenure, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaving North Korea isolated.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea watchers also say Kim Yong Nam had an expertise in third-world diplomacy. He was a frequent participant in gatherings of nations that consider themselves independent from major power blocs, including the 2012 Non-Aligned Movement summit in Iran.\n \n\n   \n  People who met Kim Yong Nam described him as mild-mannered but staunch in his opinions.\n \n\n   \n  “I found Kim Yong Nam a puzzling figure. In greetings before business began, he was cordial and relaxed, but once at work, he relentlessly followed his script in a way that reminded of former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko,” former Washington Post reporter Don Oberdofer wrote in his book, “The Two Koreas.”\n \n\n   \n  In a testament to his loyalty to the ruling dynasty, Kim Yong Nam read an elegy to Kim Il Sung when he died in 1994. Kim Yong Nam also undertook the job of formally nominating Kim Jong Il to be chairman of the National Defense Commission after the son observed a three-year mourning period.\n \n\n   \n  A native of Pyongyang, Kim Yong Nam studied at Kim Il Sung University and Moscow State University.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/rome-tower-collapse-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Hopes Dashed as Man Extracted from Partially Collapsed Medieval Tower in Rome Dies Soon After","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A worker named Octay Stroici was rescued from a partially collapsed medieval tower, the Torre dei Conti, in Rome during renovation work on a 13th-century structure built by Pope Innocent III.

His state wasn’t immediately clear, but Adriano De Acutis, chief commander of Rome’s firefighters, said on state television channel RAI that he was conscious.\n \n\n   \n  “Since the conditions seem serious, they will now evaluate him and he was immediately taken to the hospital,” Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use a first-floor window to get near the trapped worker. But they were forced to retreat in a cloud of debris as the structure continued to give way. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.\n \n\n   \n  As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.\n \n\n   \n  “The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed there was additional rubble that covered it,” Giannini said.\n \n\n   \n  Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri had told reporters earlier that the worker was speaking to rescuers and using an oxygen mask. He added that rescuers were working with extreme caution in “a very delicate extraction operation” to avoid further collapses.\n \n\n   \n  Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition; RAI reported he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.\n \n\n   \n  No firefighters were injured in the ensuing operation.\n \n\n   \n  The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of tourists had gathered to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure crumbled, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend.\n \n\n   \n  The first collapse struck the central buttress of the structure’s southern side, and caused an underlying sloped base to fall. The second damaged part of the stairwell and roof, cultural heritage officials said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Queen Paglinawan, 27, was attending to a client in a gelato parlor next door when the tower first started coming apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,″ Paglinawan told The Associated Press as yet more rubble crashed down.\n \n\n   \n  The tower, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8 million) restoration, that includes conservations work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out “to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary” to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said. The current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.\n \n\n   \n  Italian prosecutors arrived at the scene as the rescue operation was underway, and were investigating possible charges for negligent disaster and negligent injuries, Italian media reported. It is common in Italy for investigations to begin while an event is ongoing and before possible suspects are identified.\n \n\n   \n  German student Viktoria Braeu had just finished a tour at the nearby Colosseum and was passing by the scene during the firefighters’ initial rescue attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “And then we were like, ‘It’s probably not long until it’s going to go down,’ and then it just started erupting,” said Braeu, 18.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Meloni had shared her hopes for a successful rescue.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life under the rubble and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy will have a positive outcome,” Meloni said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to thank all the law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers who are intervening with courage, professionalism, and dedication in this extremely difficult situation.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/huda-mustafa-olandria-carthen-racial-slur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-05:00","title":"The ‘Love Island’ cast keeps making terrible messes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 'Love Island USA' cast continues to face public scrutiny over social issues, most notably in a recent incident where a viewer used a racial slur against contestant Olandria Carthen during a live stream.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “Love Island USA” season 7 continues to bring the drama even months after the season concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Huda Beauty has ended its relationship with one of the show’s alums, Huda Mustafa (who is not related to the company, despite the names).\n \n\n   \n  The split came after a recent live stream in which Mustafa and her boyfriend, Louis Russell, laughed following a viewer calling her fellow “Love Island USA” contestant Olandria Carthen a racial slur.\n \n\n   \n  The pair quickly ended the call with Mustafa saying, “Yo, what the f**k? What did they say? They said a bad word” to which Russell, who was a contestant on Netflix’s “Too Hot To Handle” and “Perfect Match,” responded “They said a terrible word.”\n \n\n   \n  The moment went viral and the popular beauty brand recently posted on social media that “At Huda Beauty, kindness and humanity are at the heart of what we do.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are truly disappointed by Huda Mustafa’s recent live and we take all forms of racism very seriously,” the statement reads. “While we don’t believe her actions reflect her character, we found them deeply upsetting.”\n \n\n   \n  The company captioned their two page statement “This action was taken not because of any creator or influencers content, this was taken due to the lack of seriousness around the issue and to people close to us who were offended by the actions during the live. Please remember this is about accountability not canceling people.”\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Huda Beauty’s statement both Mustafa and Russell issued apologies.\n \n\n   \n  But it was Mustafa’s first statement posted on her Instagram stories that caused the hubbub to escalate. To some, it sounded like she was down-playing the incident, by saying she and Russell “did not hear it very well” when the person used the slur.\n \n\n   \n  A second statement, also posted on her stories, acknowledged that she had initially missed the mark with her first statement and offered a direct apology to Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to begin by saying I completely respect Olandria and it’s extremely disheartening that anyone, especially a presumed child, would find it excusable to use this type of language, and doing so only underlines the ignorance of the gravity that such a word carries. Olandria – it is now clear that this comment was targeted at you, and I apologize for my immediate reaction,” Mustafa wrote. “My reaction in that moment came from being caught off guard, not from finding the word or situation funny. It was a nervous, uncomfortable reaction that I recognize was inappropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  Russell also issued a statement writing “I’d like to extend my sincerest apology to all those affected by the caller who used language that completely goes against everything we stand for.”\n \n\n   \n  “As a Black man, I have a greater empathy through my own lived experiences battling racism and the idea that a flustered response to a very unnerving situation could be misinterpreted for me not taking the matter seriously is incredibly disheartening,” he wrote. “This was an extremely unfortunate situation, one that in no way reflects my values, not Huda’s.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen also took to social media to express her feelings, writing that she does not “condone racism of any kind, nor do I entertain it.”\n \n\n   \n  “That kind of language is never acceptable,” she wrote. “Not in anger, not as a joke, not ever. Words like that carry generations of pain, and pretending otherwise only keeps the cycle going. Defending it, laughing about it, or making excuses is even worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen encouraged her followers “to donate to organizations dedicated to educating and uplifting the Black community like UNCF, NAACP and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not the first time that Mustafa and Carthen have faced off regarding racism.\n \n\n   \n  During the reunion show which aired in August, Carthen took Mustafa to task for not better addressing Mustafa’s followers who had been racist towards Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  A rep for Mustafa told CNN via email on Monday, “We are deeply disappointed by the decision and are happy with the impact the campaign had.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Russell and Carthen for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “Love Island USA” is a spinoff of the popular UK series which seeks to link couples up to find love. Carthen and the man she ended up with, Nic Vansteenberghe, became break out stars and were the runner- ups for season 7.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/george-banks-mass-murder-dies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-05:00","title":"Mass murderer George Banks, spared from death penalty, dies in prison 43 years after rampage","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George Banks, a biracial man convicted of murdering 13 people—including five children and three women—during a mass shooting rampage in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1982, died in prison in 2025 at age 83 from complications of kidney cancer.

At time, it was considered one of the worst mass murders in American history. He was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and one count of third-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n  Banks had been drinking at a party late at night before using an AR-15 rifle to start the rampage at his home.\n \n\n   \n  Five victims were his children, ages 1 to 6. Four more were the mothers of his children. Other victims were bystanders, including an 11-year-old child who sometimes stayed with his family, a 7-year-old child and a teenager who saw Banks leaving his home armed with the rifle and recognized him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks killed three women and five children at his home, authorities say. Then, dressed in green army fatigues with an ammunition bandolier around his chest and shoulders, Banks left, when he saw four teenagers walking to their car from a nearby friend’s house. He shot one fatally, and another, who survived, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  He stole a car and went to the Heather Highlands Trailer Park where police found the bodies of Banks’ son and the child’s mother, as well as her mother and her nephew.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Banks went to his mother’s house, who told police that Banks told her, “I killed them.

During his trial, he overruled his lawyer on strategic decisions, and argued instead that prosecutors, the judge and the mayor of Wilkes-Barre were conspiring against him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks also showed the jury gory pictures of his victims, even after his lawyer had successfully gotten the photos barred on the grounds that they were gruesome and prejudicial.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/government-shutdown-aviation-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:41:00Z","title":"Is it safe to fly during the government shutdown?

I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, how do I pay my rent?”\n \n\n   \n  For over 34 days, the federal government has been shut down. For travelers, the shutdown has caused some TSA wait times and flight delays to skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said, those delays are one way controllers are keeping passengers safe.

billion mega-deal \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:09 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark announced Monday it will buy Tylenol’s parent company Kenvue in a nearly $50 billion deal, creating a massive consumer products conglomerate.\n \n\n   \n  The merger is the latest in a recent dealmaking explosion, signaling the Trump administration’s openness toward corporate acquisitions. But it also represents a gamble that one of Kenvue’s signature products will be able to withstand increased scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  The acquisition comes a few weeks after President Donald Trump made  unfounded claims  linking autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy, sending Kenvue’s stock sharply lower. The company has  staunchly pushed back  against his administration’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  The companies said that the combined business will bring together 10 billion-dollar brands and will drive annual revenue of $32 billion. The new company will make products that “touch nearly half the global population through every stage of life,” including Johnson’s baby products, Clean & Clear skin care, Kleenex, Listerine mouthwash, and Depends adult diapers, the companies said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   Kenvue was spun off in 2022  from Johnson & Johnson, with J&J keeping its recognizable name for its larger pharmaceutical business unit and offloading its consumer brands. It was widely expected to be an acquisition target.\n \n\n   \n  The transaction is scheduled to close in the second half of next year. Following the closing, Kimberly-Clark shareholders will own about 54% of the newly combined company, with Kenvue shareholders owning the rest.\n \n\n   \n    A risky bet\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes with some considerable risks.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Kenvue reported an overall sales decline of 4.4%, as well as its its self care unit, which includes Tylenol, falling 5.3% for the quarter ending on September 28.\n \n\n   \n  The company explained that the sales declines were the result of “trade inventory reductions in certain customers,” likely that from cash-strapped customers trading down to cheaper, private labels that offer similar quality — perhaps a warning a sign to the new company that’s betting on a lineup of name-brand companies.\n \n\n   \n  And Kenvue faces potentially intense legal scrutiny over the Trump administration’s claims. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  filed a lawsuit against Kenvue , claiming that the company “deceptively” marketed Tylenol to pregnant women and that the medication is tied to an increased risk of autism. Kenvue said it will “vigorously defend” against the claims.\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu addressed the Tylenol issue on a call with analysts Monday, saying its “board carefully considered all the risks and all the opportunities” and had multiple meetings with “medical, regulatory and legal experts” and decided that the deal is a “generational value creation opportunity for both companies.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stand firmly behind the science and the safety of our products,” added Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry. “These things have been studied for decades, and we continue to stand by that science as the medical community does as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The cash-and-stock deal has Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ) paying $21.01 for each Kenvue ( KVUE ) share, a hefty premium over the $14.37 of its Friday closing price.\n \n\n   \n  But the premium is only slightly higher than the $17 a share Kenvue’s stock was trading for just before Trump held his “don’t take Tylenol” news conference on September 22. And it’s only a hair above the $20 stock price right before the first news reports suggested that the Trump administration may make a link between Tylenol and autism.\n \n\n   \n  Kenvue’s stock soared more than 16% Monday. Kimberly-Clark’s stock fell nearly 13%.\n \n\n   \n    An M&A explosion\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes as the deregulatory environment ushered in with the Trump administration has led to a rush of mergers and acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Kenvue deal is the third-largest acquisition this year, according to mergers-and-acquisitions data provider Dealogic. The $72 billion deal between railroad companies  Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern  ranks first and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund  purchase  of video games maker Electronics Arts for $55 million places second.\n \n\n   \n  After deals cooled off considerably in the post-pandemic era, M&A appears to be back in a big way this year. So far, 2025 has produced $1.9 trillion in deals in the United States, up the highest since 2021, according to Dealogic. Excluding the pandemic-fueled M&A boom, 2025’s deals hold the highest collective value since 2015 and are on pace to surpass it.\n \n\n   \n  The Kimberly-Clark acquisition of Kenvue would be the fourth-largest consumer products deal of all time, behind only Altria’s $111 billion spin-off of Philip Morris International in 2008, British American Tobacco’s 2015 purchase of Reynolds American for $64 billion, and P&G’s 2005 Gillette acquisition for $61 billion.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-social-media-james-comey-letitia-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-05:00","title":"Justice Department defends Lindsey Halligan and Trump’s social media posts targeting James Comey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department defends both the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for Northern Virginia and the indictments against James Comey and Letitia James, arguing that President Donald Trump’s social media posts do not constitute a direct call for prosecution of Comey, and that Halligan’s appointment was lawful even after the 120-day interim limit.

posts targeting James Comey \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn  Polantz, Devan Cole, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:46 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s personal vendetta against James Comey did not lead to his indictment, the Justice Department said in a court filing Monday, urging a judge not to throw out the charges against the former FBI director over Trump’s extraordinary  social media post  calling for his prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  The claim arose as prosecutors try to undermine Comey’s key defense  — that he is being  “singled out” for prosecution  because he has criticized Trump — and dive further into battle between the Justice Department and Comey over whether the former FBI director was prosecuted simply because he is one of the president’s longtime foes.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendant spins a tale that requires leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism, then he calls the President’s post a direct admission,”  prosecutors wrote. \n \n\n   \n  “None of the President’s social-media posts express a desire for the defendant to be penalized for exercising his First Amendment rights. Far from it,” they continued. “The President’s social-media posts are clear on why he thinks the defendant should be prosecuted: he thinks the defendant is ‘guilty as hell.’”\n \n\n   \n  The crux of Comey’s argument is that Trump has made no secret of his vitriol for him during the president’s yearlong vendetta against the FBI for its investigation into Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has focused his animosity on Comey, his attorneys argued, citing an extraordinary list of public statements in which Trump called him a liar and suggested he should be investigated and prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  But the “smoking-gun evidence,” defense attorneys said, was Trump’s  social media post  days before an indictment was handed up declaring Comey was “guilty as hell” and demanding of the Attorney General that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors rebuffed the argument, saying that Trump has long showed his belief that Comey should be criminally charged. In fact, they said, Trump had accused Comey of committing a crime even before the former director began publicly criticizing him.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s repeated posts suggest he “disfavors” Comey, prosecutors said, many of them also show that Trump believed Comey “leaked information” and “lie[d] under oath” – the same allegations that comprise the case against him. Therefore, they argued, it would take “contrived reading” of those posts to conclude Trump wanted Comey charged because of his criticism of the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Halligan’s appointment\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in a separate Monday filing  defended the legitimacy of the prosecutor  who Comey’s indictment, as well as the indictment of  New York Attorney General Letitia James . The department argued the Interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is lawfully serving in a role she was appointed to.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge is weighing bids by Comey and James to have their charges thrown out based on their claim that Halligan, who convinced federal grand juries to approve the charges against Comey and James, is not lawfully serving in the position.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan was tapped for the post after Trump pushed out the former interim US attorney, Erik Siebert. Both Comey and James claim Siebert had already served the legally allotted maximum of 120 days that someone can serve on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate and that Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not legally able to appoint a new interim attorney and avoid the Senate confirmation process.\n \n\n   \n  But in court papers submitted Monday, the Justice Department pushed back strongly on those assertions and told US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie that even if she were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “Even were Ms. Halligan’s appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied. While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan’s appointment as interim US Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office,” the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The government attorneys argue that federal law does not bar the attorney general from appointing a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Attorney General must revisit her interim appointments every 120 days. They do not automatically renew,” they wrote. “At the same time, Congress did not hamstring the Attorney General with an artificial, one-time-only appointment window.”\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments over Halligan’s authority next week. Three other judges around the country have concluded that a trio of Trump’s choices for US attorney in other districts are serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  Should James and Comey succeed in persuading the judge that Halligan was unlawfully appointed, it could doom both cases since Halligan was the only prosecutor to sign the indictments.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Letitia James subpoena\n \n\n   \n  In a separate filing, the Justice Department on Monday defended its subpoenas to James, the New York attorney general, seeking records relating to civil investigations into the Trump Organization and National Rifle Association.\n \n\n   \n  James had  moved to quash the subpoenas , which were issued in August, saying they are overly broad, infringe on state rights, and are invalid because they are signed by John Sarcone, the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, who they say is serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in its filing,  which was unsealed on Monday , said that motion should be denied.\n \n\n   \n  “Acting United States Attorney John A. Sarcone III’s status in that role is irrelevant. The grand jury can issue subpoenas, and AUSAs and special attorneys (like Mr. Sarcone) can conduct grand jury investigations, regardless of the status of the United States Attorney. In any event, Mr. Sarcone is validly serving as Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In support of its position, DOJ also points to a New York State appellate judge’s dissenting opinion in the civil fraud case. Trump did not raise the issue of selective prosecution in his appeal of the civil fraud case. But the judge wrote that James brought the lawsuit “out of partisan political motives.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers have said the investigation was launched after Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress alleging values for properties were manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ also wrote that the subpoena was sent to the office of the attorney general “no individual, including Attorney General James, have been identified as targets of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James has pleaded not guilty to charges related to an investigation into alleged mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections heading into Tuesday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City indicates a shift in voter sentiment and demographics, with Democrats gaining a stronger position in early voting compared to Kamala Harris’s performance in 2024.

Edward Wu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:11 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that the  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into Election Day in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may have emerged in a stronger position than in the primary. But a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base  also surged through early in-person voting.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n  Note: In all three locations, early in-person voting has concluded, while mail ballots can continue to arrive over the coming days.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters relative to 2024 in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year before Election Day. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at the equivalent point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also held a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  As of the end of early in-person voting on November 2, Democrats represented a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year. Registered Democrats led registered Republicans in total pre-election votes by 22 points, compared to a 16-point lead at this time last year, according to data from Catalist.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters turned out more; younger voters caught up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters turned out more at the start of in-person early voting than in the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate got younger through the early voting period and is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections.\n \n\n   \n  The electorate is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections, and a CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections found that daily turnout among Democrats got younger over the course of early in-person voting: While older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the final day.\n \n\n   \n  Now, about 49% of registered Democratic early in-person voters (51% of all early in-person voters) are ages 50 and up, while 17% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (16% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s roughly the same as the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18 to 29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is also far younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes was more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts cast 177% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts cast 132% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into Election Day than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes and mail ballots is similar to what they were at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a slightly larger share of the pre-election vote this year (22%) than they did at this point last year (19%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  During early in-person voting, counties where Trump won last year averaged 62% of their in-person votes cast last year, while Harris-won counties finished at 60%. The worst performing counties were places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they finished at just 55% of the in-person votes they cast last year.\n \n\n   \n  Harris-won counties finished in-person early voting strongly, narrowing the gap from 10 points to 2 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-05:00","title":"Defense expert testifies ex-assistant principal met standards in teacher shooting case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile civil lawsuit worth $40 million, former teacher Abby Zwerner claims that former assistant principal Ebony Parker ignored multiple warnings about a 6-year-old student reportedly carrying a firearm at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia.

Dr. Amy Klinger, an expert in education administration and school safety, said it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the teacher, Abby Zwerner, rested their case last week, and the defense rested Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The  civil trial  could set a precedent for holding school officials accountable for gun violence on campus and comes ahead of Parker’s criminal trial next month on eight counts of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n    School safety is a shared responsibility\n \n\n   \n  Klinger testified the assistant principal’s role is collaborative and school safety is a shared responsibility among all staff, not just one individual. “No one is the sole person responsible for school safety,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She explained that assessing threats requires gathering credible information from those closest to the situation and that not every concern warrants an immediate or aggressive response.\n \n\n   \n  Parker did not breach professional standards or act with indifference, Klinger said, and it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident, especially given the rarity of a 6-year-old bringing a weapon to school.\n \n\n   \n  Klinger also said crisis plans provide guidance but require professional judgment and flexibility.\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination, Zwerner’s attorney, Kevin Biniazan, questioned whether Parker should have taken more proactive steps after being told a specific student was reported to have a gun, rather than waiting for more information.\n \n\n   \n  He highlighted Parker did not attempt to identify or speak directly with the students who reported the gun and pressed Klinger on whether this was sufficient effort to get “good information.”\n \n\n   \n  Biniazan emphasized Parker was aware of the possibility of a firearm on campus for about an hour and questioned whether her actions in that time were adequate.\n \n\n   \n  He asked Klinger to rate the likelihood of a gun being on campus at various points in the day, suggesting the risk increased as more information was received, and challenged whether Parker’s response — such as not searching the student or calling a lockdown — was an “underreaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Dr. Leigh Hagan, a board-certified forensic and clinical psychologist also testifying for the defense, said he reviewed extensive records to assess whether proper forensic standards were followed in forming mental health opinions for the court, though he did not personally evaluate Zwerner or offer opinions on her diagnosis or liability.\n \n\n   \n  He testified a mental health expert’s opinion is enhanced when they look at all of the information.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a responsibility … that you have the full movie of the person’s life, rather than a snapshot,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker, who resigned two weeks after the shooting, argues she is not responsible for the student harming his teacher and had no legal duty to intervene. Damages are not warranted, Parker argues, because Zwerner has moved on with her life.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s pain and suffering have been the focus of the trial so far, and Parker’s defense team this week is expected to continue to press Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done between learning of the possible gun threat and when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawsuit alleges Parker ignored “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched.”\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher said she thought she was going to die\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner on Thursday testified she thought her wounds were dire.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” the former first-grade teacher said as she recounted being shot in the hand and chest while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, a psychiatrist testified, and her hand will never be normal, even after six surgeries, an orthopedic surgeon said.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner also has changed since the  shooting  more than two years ago, her twin sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner testified last week.\n \n\n   \n    Parker also faces criminal charges\n \n\n   \n  As school shootings  continue to plague  US campuses, this civil trial could serve as a roadmap for the upcoming criminal case against Parker, which itself could set a broader precedent.\n \n\n   \n  Attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  It is also rare for civil cases to precede criminal ones, but it could be strategic in the case of Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in her trial next month, legal experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the mother of the child who shot Zwerner has been  sentenced to two years  in prison for child neglect, the school board voted out the superintendent and the principal was reassigned to another school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial resumes Wednesday, after Election Day Tuesday.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:24:00-05:00","title":"Will SNAP benefits be paid in November?

This decision, which follows a court order requiring the agency to either provide full or partial benefits, has caused significant delays in benefit disbursement. States were instructed to halt benefit issuance on October 10, and the process of issuing partial payments is complicated by outdated systems, requiring technical updates that could take weeks or months. The USDA redirected $750 million from tariff revenue to the WIC program but declined to do the same for SNAP, citing risks to other programs. As a result, nearly 13.7 million recipients will receive benefits in a staggered fashion, with some receiving retroactive payments once the government reopens. The decision has drawn criticism from advocacy groups and a coalition of Democratic-led states and civil organizations, who argue that full benefits would have been faster, more equitable, and in

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:24 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Food stamp recipients will  only get half  of their typical benefits in November, and for many, that assistance will likely be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture said in a court filing Monday that it will only tap into the program’s contingency fund, which doesn’t have enough money to cover enrollees’ full allotments during the government shutdown. The agency said it will not use an additional pot of money to make up the difference in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for  food stamps .\n \n\n   \n  The move came after a federal judge in Rhode Island  ordered  the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund. A second federal judge also ruled last week that the agency is required at least to use the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA’s unprecedented decision to halt food stamps benefits in November prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue last week.\n \n\n   \n  Both judges said it was up to the agency whether to tap into other money to enable it to provide the full allocation. The agency has opted to transfer $750 million in unused tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs to support the  WIC nutrition assistance program  during the shutdown but said it can’t do the same for SNAP without endangering the free and reduced-price school meals and other programs.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  The much-needed SNAP assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Several procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people who receive food stamps. SNAP provides households with just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has been felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should have received their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, told CNN last week of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, providing partial payments is much more complicated — and time consuming.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA has never had to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients before, according to a declaration filed Friday by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies will need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” said Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services,  in a second declaration filed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA will provide guidance on calculating the partial payments to states on Monday, Penn told the court.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, Plata-Nino noted.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP enrollees who receive partial benefits in November will get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Providing full benefits would have been the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told CNN last week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated following the Department of Agriculture’s announcement that it would pay partial SNAP benefits for November. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/americas/day-of-the-dead-mexico-traditions-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"The Day of the Dead’s ancient traditions live on in this small Mexican town","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In San Andrés Mixquic, a small town near Mexico City, families honor their deceased loved ones during the Day of the Dead, a tradition rooted in ancient Aztec practices and blended with European Christian customs.

ancient traditions live on in this small Mexican town \n       \n  By Rocío Muñoz-Ledo, Max Saltman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The route from the land of the dead to San Andrés Mixquic, a little town just outside Mexico City, is lined with marigolds. Ángel Jiménez del Aguila, who died in 2010, need only follow the trail of flower petals, the scent of smoldering copal and the rhythm of  danzón  music to find his old front door, where his wife and children wait for him.\n \n\n   \n  According to Mexican tradition, every year, the door between the world of the living and the dead swings open on the first two days of November. This is Día de los Muertos,  the Day of the Dead .\n \n\n   \n  Often mischaracterized as a Mexican version of Halloween, the Day of the Dead is many things depending on whom you ask.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a festival to remember departed relatives, a celebration of Mexican-ness, an ancient holiday with roots in the Aztec Empire, a not-so-ancient Mexican spin on All Saint’s Day, the setting for  Disney’s “Coco”  – or all the above.\n \n\n   \n  “It is an act of faith, of love, of peace,” says Martha Nashieli Jiménez Bernal, Ángel’s daughter. For her, above all, the Day of the Dead is “a magical moment where life and death come together.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 12 o’clock, welcome dad!” Martha says, waving a smoking censer back and forth over the golden flowers that snake from the garden gate into the parlor of her childhood home. “Welcome.”\n \n\n   \n  The trail of marigold petals leads to an  ofrenda , an altar covered with even more flowers, colorful cloth, fruit, candy skulls and photos of Ángel and other relatives.\n \n\n   \n  Martha breaks chunks of copal into her censer as she kneels before the altar. Standing up, she holds up a plate of  pan de Muertos –  sweet baked bread in the shape of skulls.\n \n\n   \n  “Dad, welcome to your home, with your children,” Martha says, her voice cracking with emotion. “You know we love you, and I’ve been looking forward to this day so much, to be able to be with you again. Welcome, Ángel Jiménez.”\n \n\n   \n     Changing times \n \n\n   \n  In recent years, celebrations for the Day of the Dead have taken on new influences,   some gleaned from Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  The same day that the Jiménez family was welcoming their loved ones in the intimacy of their house, a popular parade for the Day of the Dead filled the streets of Mexico City. The practice is very new: it was adopted after the 2015 James Bond movie “Spectre”    showed Daniel Craig making his way through a lively Day of the Dead parade in its opening scene.\n \n\n   \n  Even in San Andrés Mixquic, known for its traditional celebrations, some wear the sort of spooky Halloween costumes sold in the United States, although local families themselves do not dress up.\n \n\n   \n  For the Jiménez family, the Day of the Dead is a deeply personal tradition. They take pride in preparing their altar with fruits from the local market and carefully cleaning their relatives’ headstones. Martha even gathers the flowers by hand from the family’s  chinampa , a traditional floating garden the Aztecs cultivated hundreds of years ago, making the ritual both intimate and rooted in family history.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a treasure, it is a gift. It is an inheritance that we are living,” says Leonor Bernal Roque, Martha’s mother. Her earliest memory is of her grandfather decorating their family’s altar when she was five years old.\n \n\n   \n  “From the age of five,” she says, “I began to feel love for my ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead teaches “that death is a transition, it is not a punishment,” she says. People “must practice gratitude toward their ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Memory should be important,” Leonor says.\n \n\n   \n     History lesson \n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead unfolds over three days in San Andrés Mixquic. On October 31, the family commemorates the souls of children at the altar. The next day, November 1, they greet their adult relatives, like Martha’s father Angel. The third day, families gather at the cemetery from morning till night to decorate graves and say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  While the holiday has its roots in the Aztec empire prior to Spain’s conquest in 1521, the modern-day celebration blends indigenous Mexican themes with the European Christian tradition of All Saint’s Day, when some Christians visit their departed loved ones in cemeteries.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after arriving in the Americas , Spanish monks noticed the Aztecs had their own celebrations to commune with departed ancestors, according to historian Héctor Zaraus.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Aztec, Zapotec, and Mayan calendar, one of the months was dedicated to the dead, and it was   adapted to the first and second of November with the arrival of the Spanish,” says Zaraus, a scholar at the Mora Institute in Mexico City.\n \n\n   \n  The indigenous elements are the most prominent parts of the contemporary ceremony, Zaraus says, especially the tombs festooned with marigolds. Even the photographs on family altars have their roots in ancient times: Zaraus says the Aztecs “used clay figures to portray the dead.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s more than one way to celebrate the Day of the Dead, however. María del Carmen Eugenia Reyes Ruiz, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, notes that the celebration differs throughout Mexico. She also says that, while some aspects of the modern-day celebration may have ancient roots, others are far more recent additions than might commonly be believed.\n \n\n   \n  “As for the way we celebrate it in Mexico – with colors, candles, altars, and flower paths – I think it’s also worth noting that it isn’t common throughout the entire country, and it’s certainly not as ancient as it’s often made to seem,” Reyes says. “It’s a very romantic and beautiful idea, but not entirely accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of other cultures have similar ceremonies, some older than Mexico’s, Reyes says. For thousands of years, families in China have celebrated  Qingming  after the spring equinox, cleaning and decorating their ancestor’s graves and offering plates of sweet dumplings.\n \n\n   \n  “Although it may sound a little unromantic, there’s something I’d like to make clear,” Reyes says. “The idea of the Day of the Dead celebration, while it is indeed part of Mexican culture, is not exclusive to Mexico.”\n \n\n   \n     The doorway closes \n \n\n   \n  The sun has set in San Andrés Mixquic, but the cemetery here is filled with light. Nearly everyone in town is here for the signature, final celebration of the Day of the Dead. The door between this world and the next is about to close, and it’s time to say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  After days of cleaning graves and decorating tombstones, the graveyard is awash in color and flickering candles. It’s loud – people are cheerfully talking, remembering their loved ones, playing music, eating food and toasting with mezcal. The bells in the church nearby are tolling.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tourists from around the world wander the cemetery, the Jiménez family treats the holiday as a sacred communion, inviting outsiders only to witness and participate respectfully. Martha says that even these tourists, some of whom come from places as far as Japan, are playing a part in the festivities: their curiosity is part of what keeps the tradition alive.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a kind of communion,” she muses as she stands at her father’s grave. “A bond is formed, a connection with them. Even if we don’t know them, we know they come with respect and a desire to learn about our traditions. So, we invite them to come respectfully – to come live our tradition, to get to know it, to preserve it, to take it back to their own homes.”\n \n\n   \n  Diana, Martha’s 19-year-old niece, agrees. She’s made up her face to look like a skull and holds a candle under her chin.\n \n\n   \n  “Tourists, if they have a family member, can also set up their own offering, and in this way, this tradition won’t die,” Diana says. “My family, especially my aunt (Martha), is the one who has instilled this tradition in us so much.”\n \n\n   \n  As the night ends in the graveyard, the family toasts Ángel with mezcal.\n \n\n   \n  “My family is happy and joyful because these were days of hard work, days of great effort,” Martha says. “Some siblings came from far away; others could not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  Martha does not have children, but she knows that she’s entrusted her nieces and nephews with the traditions to keep the Day of the Dead alive long after she’s buried in this cemetery herself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want them to also welcome me the day I depart,” Martha says. “I want them not to forget me, to know that their aunt will come, and that I love them in the most organic way possible. That they receive me with all the love I gave them – and I know they will. I’m sure of it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/how-exit-polls-different-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:48:00Z","title":"What to know about exit polls and how they’ve changed for this year’s elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This year’s exit polls mark a significant shift in methodology, as major media networks including CNN, ABC, CBS, Fox News, NBC, and the Associated Press are collaborating with nonpartisan research firm SSRS to produce more inclusive and representative voter data.

threatened to cut off its access to the French market.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend, France’s anti-fraud office, the DGCCRF, accused the  fast-fashion platform  of selling sex dolls “with a childlike appearance,” saying in a statement: “Their description and their categorization on the site make it difficult to doubt the pedopornographic nature of the content.”\n \n\n   \n  The dolls were available for purchase on the French version of Shein’s platform until 4 a.m. local time Monday, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, which prompted a stark warning from French Finance Minister Roland Lescure.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be very clear: If these behaviors are repeated, we will be entitled to… ban access to the French market for the Shein platform,” he told BFMTV Monday. “These horrible objects are illegal,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the controversy, Shein said it had implemented a “complete ban on all sex-doll products, removing every related listing and visual from the platform,” telling CNN in a Monday statement that its “adult products” category had been temporarily delisted while a comprehensive review was carried out.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Tang, Shein’s executive chairman, said the “fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for SHEIN.”\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese-founded company said in an earlier statement that the relevant products were removed from sale as soon as the company became aware of “these serious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  “We take this matter extremely seriously,” that statement said. “Such content is completely unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for. We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of this scandal couldn’t be worse for the Chinese platform. On Wednesday, Shein is due to open its very first brick-and-mortar store in Paris – the first in the world – which will be followed by more shops across France.\n \n\n   \n  French authorities have passed the case onto French prosecutors, as well as the French telecom regulator, according to Lescure.\n \n\n   \n  In its statement, the anti-fraud office said the sharing of pedophilic material on “electronic networks” is punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment and a €100,000 ($115,000) fine under French law. It also said the sale of the dolls shows Shein does not have sufficient safeguards in place against minors accessing pornographic material on its website, also a crime under French law.\n \n\n   \n  France’s High Commissioner for Childhood, Sarah El-Haïry, told BFMTV Monday that she wanted to identify both the sellers and buyers of these dolls.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, online retail giant  Amazon  was embroiled in a similar affair, after third-party sellers used the platform to hawk child sex dolls.

living — and the dead \n       \n  By David Culver, Joe Merkel and Sean Walker, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air smells of damp earth and drying mud. Smoke from debris fires mixes with a faint tang of fuel from the few generators that still have gas. Every sound carries: the strike of hammers and the scrape of shovels as Jamaicans try to dig out and rebuild after Hurricane Melissa slammed into the island.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached the  hardest-hit western parishes  and the towns of Belmont, Black River and White House, where destruction is uneven but staggering. Some neighborhoods are gutted, others look untouched.\n \n\n   \n  Roofs were peeled away, and windows blown out in the Category 5 hurricane, leaving no protection from the rain and up to 16 feet of seawater driven onto land in the storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Possessions have been dragged out to dry as much as they can in the hot and humid conditions. And everywhere, survivors try to make sense of it all.\n \n\n   \n  Three-year-old Alessandra points to what used to be her bed. “It’s all mash up,” she says with a small smile.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Alandrea Brown, 26, walks around what remains of their home. “We are very distressed,” she says. “We really need some help because you have persons who are very homeless, and we don’t really have any food supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that help has yet to come.\n \n\n   \n  As we prepare to leave, a man points to another house. Inside, he says, a neighbor’s body still lies uncollected. Through a broken window, a sheet covers the remains of a man, one of his hands resting outside the cover.\n \n\n   \n  There was no way for neighbors to call for help. No phone signal. No road access. CNN relayed the information to authorities once the team was able. It is a haunting reminder of how cut off this region remains.\n \n\n   \n  In Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, and across the east, life goes on. Volunteers and supplies are pushing west to help people and start to heal the vital economic lifelines of tourism and agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaican officials raised the nation’s death toll to 32 on Monday. It will almost certainly rise as emergency teams reach more devastated areas.\n \n\n   \n  But for now, when night falls, the west of the island goes quiet. No power. No water. Only the chirp of insects and the distant hum of a generator. Mattresses are dragged back inside, still damp but something to sleep on. The air smells of wet wood and salt.\n \n\n   \n  By morning, long lines form for fuel, food, and clean water. Those without running taps turn to the river or rainwater pipes. Families wash clothes, fill buckets, and share stories about what they lost.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess it doesn’t really hit us yet,” says Simone Gardon, 40, when asked about the impact of the storm —  the strongest ever  to hit Jamaica. Her voice trails off as she looks to when things may become clearer. “After two weeks, when it’s all settled down and the hunger sets in…”\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors have become their own first responders. They move fallen trees, lift tangled wires, and hammer tin over broken beams. They rebuild because they must, knowing help is on the way, but not soon enough.\n \n\n   \n    Treating patients in a ruined hospital\n \n\n   \n  In Black River, the region’s main hospital is barely standing. Rain leaks through the roof. Corridors sit in darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Medical Officer Dr. Sheriff Imoru tells CNN his home was destroyed too, compounding his heartache. “When I see this place, my hospital, it’s very difficult even to come through the gates in the mornings. But I have to.”\n \n\n   \n  He and his staff, many of whom also lost their homes, keep showing up. The emergency room still operates without power or running water.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the few dry rooms, Shaniel Tomlin holds her one-year-old son, Jahmar, who hit his head after the storm. He’s covered in bandages, like a war veteran. She has a prescription in her hand, but nowhere to fill it.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s gone,” she says softly, her eyes welling as the weight of what’s ahead begins to sink in.\n \n\n   \n  Across this centuries-old coastal town, buildings like the courthouse, library, government offices and the elementary school are destroyed.\n \n\n   \n  From Kingston, trucks loaded with food, fuel and aid wind their way west, at times sitting for hours in traffic as roads are slowly cleared.\n \n\n   \n  “We are resilient,” says Lisa Hanna, a former member of parliament. “There’s almost an empathetic solidarity across the island and across the world to get things here. We’re not going to make our people starve.”\n \n\n   \n  Groups including World Central Kitchen, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan’s Purse are already on the ground, setting up kitchens and delivering water. Relief teams expect to stay for months. And even that may not be enough.\n \n\n   \n  The tourism industry, the backbone of Jamaica’s economy, is watching closely. Officials stress that much of the island remains open, especially the north and east, as peak season begins next month. But in the west, where Melissa hit hardest, rebuilding will take time.\n \n\n   \n  When a radio signal returns, so does the sound of resilience. Music drifts through the salt air as roadside vendors fry fish on bare concrete slabs, their foodstands long washed away. The scent of smoke and the rhythm of song fill what silence the storm left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “We are Jamaicans,” one man shouts. “We are the strongest people in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The winds are gone, the water has receded, but the scars will last.

3-time Oscar nominee, dies at 89 \n       \n  By The Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Diane Ladd , the three-time Academy Award nominee whose roles ranged from the brash waitress in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” to the protective mother in “Wild at Heart,” has died at 89.\n \n\n   \n  Ladd’s death was announced Monday by daughter  Laura Dern , who issued a statement saying her mother and occasional co-star had died at her home in Ojai, California, with Dern at her side. Dern, who called Ladd her “amazing hero” and “profound gift of a mother,” did not immediately cite a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  “She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” Dern wrote. “We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”\n \n\n   \n  A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 release “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appears in dozens of movies over the following decades. Her many credits included “Chinatown,” “Primary Colors” and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, “Wild at Heart” and “Rambling Rose,” both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in “ER,” “Touched by Angel” and “Alice,” the spinoff from “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” among others.\n \n\n   \n  Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura’s father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in “Rambling Rose” and they also were memorably paired in “Wild at Heart,” a personal favorite of Ladd’s and winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In the dark, farcical  David Lynch  noir, her character, Marietta, is willing to try anything – including murder – to keep her daughter (Laura Dern) away from her ex-con lover, played by Nicolas Cage. Ladd would be called upon by the director for some Lynchian touches, and countered with some of her own.\n \n\n   \n  “One day, the script said that Marietta gets in bed, curls up with her baby dog, and is sucking her thumb,” she told Vulture in 2024. “I looked at him and said, ‘David, I don’t want to do that.’ He said, ’What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘I want to put on a long satin nightgown, I want to stand in the middle of the bed holding a martini and drinking it, and I want to sway to the old music within my head.’ He said ‘OK.’ I did it, and he loved it.”\n \n\n   \n  A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was born Rose Diane Ladner and was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, “Spiraling Through the School of Life,” she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day in “front of a screen” and would “command” her own audiences. Before “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” she had been working in television since the 1950s, when she was in her early 20s, with shows including “Perry Mason,” “Gunsmoke” and “The Big Valley.”\n \n\n   \n  By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I don’t say that,” she said. “I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.”\n \n\n   \n  Ladd was married three times, and divorced twice – from Bruce Dern and from William A. Shea, Jr. In 1976, around the time her second marriage ended, she told the Times that neither of her husbands knew “how to show love.”\n \n\n   \n  “I come from the South and from a man, my father, who gave me rocking‐chair love. My people pass love around, and why I selected two men who needed someone to give love and didn’t know how to give it. …” She paused. “I hope I won’t repeat that again.”\n \n\n   \n  Ladd’s third marriage, to author-former PepsiCo executive Robert Charles Hunter, lasted from 1999 until his death in August.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/nebraska-cornhusker-clink-ice-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:37:00Z","title":"An Undocumented Mother Says ICE Raids and 'Cornhusker Clink' Are the End of the Nebraska She’s Called Home for Decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article chronicles how a nationwide immigration crackdown under the Trump administration has transformed Nebraska—a historically welcoming state with a strong Latino and immigrant workforce—into a focal point for federal immigration enforcement.

   \n  By Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, Amanda Musa, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:37 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alejandra doesn’t leave her home unless she really needs to. She skips doctor’s appointments and church to remain undetected. And if she is detained by immigration enforcement officials, her 13-year-old son is prepared with a list of people to call and his social security number memorized.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot be separated from my kids,” said the 30-year-old undocumented mother of four children who were born in the United States. “I just can’t risk it.” CNN agreed to only use Alejandra’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns due to her immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  The idea that her family might be ripped apart only crossed her mind recently, she said, when President Donald Trump’s nationwide  immigration crackdown  penetrated the humble, quiet Nebraska community she calls home.\n \n\n   \n  In June, a  meatpacking plant in Omaha  was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in what the agency described as the  largest worksite operation  in the state since the start of the Trump administration. Alejandra says several family friends and church acquaintances were among the dozens of people detained.\n \n\n   \n  As that event continues to generate aftershocks, a new ICE detention center, dubbed the  “Cornhusker Clink,”  is opening in western Nebraska soon and is expected to hold up to 300 adults, a spokesperson for Nebraska’s Republican Gov. Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/presidential-pardons-trump-biden-gop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:08:00Z","title":"Trump Admits He Doesn’t Know Who He Pardoned; GOP Criticizes Biden’s Pardon Practices","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The House Republican Oversight Committee has criticized President Joe Biden for allegedly delegating pardon decisions to staff and using memos to authorize pardons without direct presidential oversight, suggesting he lacked personal knowledge of the individuals involved.

Trump now admits he doesn’t know whom he’s pardoning \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:08 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  House Republicans issued  a report  last week suggesting Joe Biden wasn’t really calling the shots as president. And they argued that his presidential pardons epitomized this dynamic.\n \n\n   \n  Biden appeared so disengaged from the process, the House Oversight Committee’s report claimed, that it called into question “the validity of all pardons reportedly granted” by him.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson later said Biden mass-pardoned people without knowing “what the categories were apparently — much less the individual people that he pardoned.”\n \n\n   \n  But President Donald Trump now says he didn’t know much about one of his own most controversial recent pardons — that of  Changpeng Zhao , founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n \n\n   \n  The president also emphasized that he was relying on things people around him said.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know who he is,” Trump said in  a “60 Minutes” interview  that aired Sunday. He soon added that he knew “nothing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Back on October 23, Trump offered similar comments. When pressed on the pardon by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Trump  didn’t seem to know who Collins was asking about , despite the pardon having been issued the very same day.\n \n\n   \n  “Oh, the recent one, yes,” Trump said when Collins refreshed his memory. “I believe we’re talking about the same person, because I do pardon a lot of people.”\n \n\n   \n  (In fact, Zhao was the only person Trump had pardoned that week.)\n \n\n   \n  The GOP’s fixation on Biden and his use of the autopen has  long strained the known facts . The argument seems to be that Biden’s actions were invalid because he supposedly wasn’t making the decisions.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump keeps complicating that message by disclaiming his own role in and knowledge of major decisions — the kinds of things a president should be aware of. It’s not just pardons; he’s done it repeatedly with  major foreign policy decisions .\n \n\n   \n  While Trump has pardoned an extraordinary number of allies and Republicans, the Zhao pardon is on a different level because of the seeming personal conflicts of interest involved.\n \n\n   \n  It’s controversial because Binance is the cryptocurrency exchange that hosts the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The pardon could allow it to operate in the US again. Binance has also been a significant platform for the sale of World Liberty Financial’s proprietary tokens, which have netted the Trump family hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, Binance has helped and could help the Trump family make a lot of money, and the president pardoned someone who plays a significant role in that.\n \n\n   \n  For these reasons, the pardon has earned comparisons to some of the  most controversial pardons in modern history , including former President Bill Clinton’s pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich after Rich’s ex-wife donated to Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  But to hear Trump tell it, he made this monumental decision without really digging into the situation himself. He has repeatedly suggested he was basically doing what others urged him to do.\n \n\n   \n  “I have no idea who he is,” Trump told “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people — of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.”\n \n\n   \n  The president added: “Well, here’s the thing: I know nothing about it because I’m too busy.”\n \n\n   \n  Back on October 23 — the day of the pardon — Trump said: “I don’t know him. I don’t believe I’ve ever met him. But I’ve been told … he had a lot of support. And they said that what he did is not even a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s all pretty difficult to square with the GOP’s rhetoric about Biden, including last week’s House Oversight Committee report.\n \n\n   \n  “The authority to grant pardons is not provided to the president’s inner circle,”  the report  said. “Nor can it be delegated to particular staff when a president’s competency is in question.”\n \n\n   \n  The report also faulted the Biden administration for giving the Democratic president  talking points to discuss his more controversial pardons. It intimated that this suggested Biden hadn’t played a major role in them.\n \n\n   \n  “It is striking that President Biden needed any notecards or talking points to talk about his son[’s pardon], especially about a decision recently made about him,” the report said.\n \n\n   \n  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer suggested the fact that pardons were presented to Biden in memo form suggested he wasn’t involved enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Some staffer would type a memo, then Joe Biden would read the memo authorizing the use of the autopen, then sign his initial and then someone used that memo,” the Kentucky Republican  told CNN’s Jake Tapper  last week.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed Monday by CNN’s Manu Raju to account for the similarities between what the oversight report alleged about Biden and what Trump said on “60 Minutes,” Johnson  demurred .\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know anything about that,” the speaker said. “I didn’t see the interview. You’d have to ask the president about that. I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Comer likewise punted on Monday. He explained that Trump sometimes “says things, and we have to really analyze and give him another opportunity to make sure he didn’t misspeak, and things like that.”\n \n\n   \n  Comer suggested the president might have misspoken despite Trump having said such things twice, more than a week apart.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump himself has attacked Biden for allegedly knowing too little about his own pardons.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that they’re null and void, because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in March.\n \n\n   \n  Trump added in  a social media post  the next day: “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!”\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward nearly eight   months, and Trump seems to be making a similar argument about himself. Not only has he insisted he doesn’t know much about one of his most controversial pardons to date, but he also didn’t seem to have any idea what a reporter was talking about when questioned on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the similarities, we probably shouldn’t hold our breath for the GOP-led House Oversight Committee to launch a similar probe into Trump.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reaction.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"03:58:00-05:00","title":"Suspects Charged in Alleged Terror Plot Cited ISIS and May Have Tried to Replicate Paris Terror Attack on US Soil, FBI Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in the United States, with plans to replicate the 2015 Paris attacks on Halloween.

He declined to provide additional details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n    Suspects bought AR-15-style rifles and over 1,600 rounds of ammo, agent says \n \n\n   \n  Ali and an unidentified juvenile were “planning to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the designated foreign terrorist organization ISIS,” an FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint, citing communications on an encrypted app.\n \n\n   \n  Further investigation revealed Mahmoud and others were co-conspirators in the plot, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n  Ali purchased a shotgun, an AR-15-style rifle and multiple accessories, including “a forced reset trigger that allows a shooter to increase the rate of fire in a semiautomatic weapon,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also bought an AR-15-style rifle and more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used in AR-15 style rifles he and Ali had purchased, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n    A suspect mentions doing the ‘same thing as France’ on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In addition to meeting in person, Ali, Mahmoud, the juvenile and co-conspirators chatted online, sharing “extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks similar to what they planned,” the FBI agent wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Ali and the juvenile “discussed when to conduct their attack, which they appeared to set for Halloween,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The pair allegedly said they were going to do the “same thing as France,” the complaint says. And a conversation with a co-conspirator included mention of someone potentially going “to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  The agent took this to be a reference to the multifaceted terror rampage in France, which  killed at least 130 people in 2015 . ISIS claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n \n\n   \n  ISIS also claimed responsibility for a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was popular with the LGBTQ community,  killed 49 people .\n \n\n   \n  Ali, Mahmoud and the juvenile traveled to clubs in Ferndale, Michigan, the FBI complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  “All three of these clubs are located on Woodward Avenue near East Nine Mile,” the agent wrote. “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of the neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents Ali, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN before the criminal complaint was released.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who said he is representing another suspect arrested in the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin” day reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN prior to the release of the criminal complaint. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/colorado-funeral-home-bodies-fake-ashes","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:05:00Z","title":"Judge Rejects Plea Deal for Funeral Home Owner Accused of Stashing Nearly 190 Decaying Bodies","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Colorado judge has rejected the plea deals of Carie and Jon Hallford, owners of Return to Nature Funeral Home, who were accused of stashing nearly 190 decaying bodies in a rural building between 2019 and 2023.

  \n  Paramount has renewed Jon Stewart’s deal to continue hosting Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” once a week through the 2026 midterms, resolving months of speculation about the media company’s plans for the late-night show.\n \n\n   \n  Comedy Central said Monday that the show’s correspondents will continue to take turns hosting Tuesdays through Thursdays while Stewart hosts on Mondays.\n \n\n   \n  Stewart originally returned to his old show in 2024 — after first hosting from 1999 until 2015 — saying he wanted a platform to “unload thoughts as we get into this election season.”\n \n\n   \n  He still had plenty to say after President Trump returned to office in January, and he remained a reliable ratings magnet.\n \n\n   \n  However, fans began to worry about his future at Comedy Central when Paramount went through a protracted merger process and made several concessions to the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  In July, CBS, a corporate sibling of Comedy Central, cancelled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” leading many, including Stewart, a friend of Colbert’s and a producer of “The Late Show,” to question the stated rationale.\n \n\n   \n  “Was this purely financial?” Stewart asked in a scathing monologue. “Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president.”\n \n\n   \n  Media analysts noted at the time that Stewart’s contract at “The Daily Show” was expiring at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  New owners took charge of Paramount in August and signaled hopes to revitalize cable channels like Comedy Central, while cutting costs at the same time.\n \n\n   \n  Disney’s decision in September to suspend ABC late-night star Jimmy Kimmel amid pressure from the Trump administration furthered questions about the entire late-night TV landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Stewart’s position was clear. He had “more or less laid down his gauntlet about his intention not to cave as so many other media companies, law firms, and academic institutions have under bullying from Washington,” wrote Bill Carter, the author of two books about late-night TV.\n \n\n   \n  In an on-stage interview last week with Stewart, The New Yorker editor David Remnick brought up widespread perceptions of media moguls capitulating to President Trump and asked about Stewart’s status.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re working on staying,” Stewart responded.\n \n\n   \n  Now the deal is done, according to Monday’s press release from Paramount. Stewart will continue hosting and executive producing the show through December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Ari Pearce, head of Comedy Central, said in a statement that Stewart’s return “is an ongoing commitment to the incisive comedy and sharp commentary that define The Daily Show.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “We’re proud to support Jon and the extraordinary news team.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/fed-governor-lisa-cook-makes-first-public-remarks-since-trump-said-he-fired-her","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"Embattled Fed Governor Lisa Cook Makes First Public Remarks Since Trump Said He Fired Her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In her first public remarks since President Donald Trump claimed to have fired her, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook — the first Black woman to serve on the Fed and the first central bank official ever to be subjected to a presidential firing attempt — reaffirmed her commitment to achieving a 2% inflation target.

remarks since Trump said he fired her \n       \n  By Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:54 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Interest rates are in a good place to deal with persistently elevated inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Monday in her first public remarks since President Donald Trump  said he had fired her. \n \n\n   \n  Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is the first central bank official to ever be subject to a firing attempt. In a letter announcing her removal, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which still haven’t been taken to court. Cook sued Trump shortly afterwards, in what has become  a landmark case on presidential power and Fed independence  that will be decided next year   by the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The court ruled that Cook  can remain in her role for now , and has scheduled oral arguments in January. Cook said Monday she is “beyond grateful” for the support she’s received in her legal battle with the Trump administration, but didn’t comment further on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  Cook has voted to lower interest rates in the past two Fed meetings, but hadn’t commented publicly on the economy since before Trump said in August that he fired her. Fed officials routinely participate in public events to lay out their views on the economy in the spirit of transparency and helping investors understand the direction of monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  In prepared remarks for an event in Washington, DC, Cook offered a balanced perspective on the US economy, detailing the twin threat to the central bank’s dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.\n \n\n   \n  She pointed to signs of strain in the labor market, such as rising Black unemployment, but suggested there’s more urgency to finish the job on inflation than to lower rates further to prevent mass layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2% inflation target,” she said. “I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2% target.”\n \n\n   \n    The heated Fed debate\n \n\n   \n  Cook’s latest comments come at a time when Fed policymakers  are divided  on how Trump’s economic policies might impact prices, employment and economic growth.\n \n\n   \n  There were “strongly differing views” among officials at last week’s rate-setting meeting, when the Fed lowered rates  for the second time in a row , Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference. Two Fed officials cast dissenting votes, but for opposing reasons: Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted in favor a larger, half-point cut; while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\n \n\n   \n  That was the first time since 2019 there were dissents calling for both easier and tighter policy.\n \n\n   \n  On one side, Fed officials argue that any inflation spurred by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy will likely prove to be a one-off price increase and that the US labor market is at serious risk of falling off a cliff if the Fed doesn’t continue to lower rates. Most of the officials in this camp are Trump appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Powell has characterized the notion of limited tariff inflation as “reasonable.” Cook herself said “the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase.”\n \n\n   \n  The other side of the Fed debate argues that the risk of higher inflation is greater, especially when considering that inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years. In a Friday statement explaining his dissent, Schmid said he has heard “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation” from people in his district.\n \n\n   \n  “Rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top of mind,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspension of government data because of the government shutdown, which is nearing the longest on record, has made the Fed’s job of judging the economy  even more difficult. \n \n\n   \n  Cook didn’t provide a full-throated call for rate cuts in her latest remarks, but said she is attentive to the risks around the labor market. She also didn’t sound overly concerned with inflation, stating that her “assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2% once the tariff effects are behind us.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated,” Cook said. “Every meeting, including December’s, is a live meeting.”\n \n\n   \n  At the end of Monday’s event, Cook said she believes public service “is worth the scrutiny.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been motivated to do public service, given my family’s history, for example, in the civil rights movement and my participation in it myself,” she said. “And then I had to learn to have a thick skin if I thought the principle was worth pursuing.”\n \n\n   \n  “This too shall pass,” Cook added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cybersecurity-ransomeware-hacking","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-05:00","title":"Two Former Cybersecurity Workers Indicted for Hacking and Ransoming US Companies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two former cybersecurity professionals, Kevin Tyler Martin and Ryan Clifford Goldberg, have been indicted for conspiring to hack and extort US companies using the ransomware strain ALPHV.

The thriving ransomware market has grown into a threat that has disrupted critical services across the US and cost the economy billions of dollars.\n \n\n   \n  Cybersecurity firms often work very closely with the FBI and international law enforcement to track down and collect evidence on ransomware gangs, which operate across borders and time zones. Many prominent security firms have been integral to helping law enforcement put accused ransomware operators in cuffs.\n \n\n   \n  “Companies, governments and people put a lot of trust in us to try to keep them safe,” Allan Liska, who has tracked ransomware for years for cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, told CNN. “Incidents like this erode that trust and make an already difficult job even more challenging.”\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Sun-Times first  reported  on the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Martin worked for DigitalMint, an Illinois-based firm that helps victims recover from ransomware attacks and in some cases pays ransoms, according to its website.

DigitalMint has been and continues to be a cooperating witness in the investigation and not an investigative target.”\n \n\n   \n  “The charged conduct took place outside of DigitalMint’s infrastructure and systems,” DigitalMint’s statement continued. “The co-conspirators did not access or compromise client data as part of the charged conduct.”\n \n\n   \n  DigitalMint said the unnamed co-conspirator who is listed as a defendant in the indictment “may have also been a company employee.”\n \n\n   \n  “No one potentially involved in the charged scheme has worked at the company in over 4 months,” DigitalMint said.\n \n\n   \n  Sygnia Cybersecurity Services said it terminated Goldberg’s employment “immediately upon learning of the situation.”\n \n\n   \n  “While Sygnia is not a target of this investigation, we are continuing to work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” Sygnia said in its statement. “We cannot provide further comment on the ongoing federal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  In their alleged attacks, Martin and Goldberg are accused of using a ransomware known as ALPHV, one of the more prolific strains of ransomware in recent years.

We counted at least 18 inaccurate assertions.\n \n\n   \n  Trump told his usual lie that the free and fair 2020 election was stolen from him. He lied again that grocery prices “are down” even after CBS’ Norah O’Donnell informed him  they are up . He declared once more that there is now “no inflation,” though there certainly is, and then that inflation is 2% or “even less than 2%,” though the most recent available Consumer Price Index figure  is now up to 3% .\n \n\n   \n  The president also deployed multiple other fictional numbers during his exchanges with O’Donnell, which were recorded Friday and released by CBS on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump made a variety of additional false claims on several subjects, including the government shutdown, the artificial intelligence boom, tariffs, his first impeachment and his former legal battle with “60 Minutes” itself.\n \n\n   \n  CBS posted a  full transcript  of the interview, which O’Donnell  said  ran for nearly 90 minutes, and a nearly 73-minute  video ; it aired  about 28 minutes  on television.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a more detailed breakdown of Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n    The economy\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices \n \n\n   \n  When O’Donnell noted that Americans have “seen their grocery prices go up,” Trump repeated his regular false claim that grocery prices are actually declining: “No, you’re wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly.” Trump repeated later in the interview, “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n   Grocery prices are up  under Trump — and while there has been a particularly large increase in the price of beef, there have also been increases in the price of  numerous other products .  Consumer Price Index figures  for September showed average grocery prices had increased since August (about 0.3%), since September 2024 (about 2.7%), and since January 2025 (about 1.4%), the month Trump returned to office. Prices in all six major grocery product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “cereals and bakery products,” are up over the past year.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Trump \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed, “We have no inflation” and “we don’t have any inflation.” (He said at another point of the interview that “essentially we don’t have inflation.”) He also falsely claimed, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” There is inflation; it has been  worsening since May  after hitting a four-year low in April; and it’s not 2% or less than 2%. The year-over-year rate was about  3% in September , up from about  2.9% in August ; the September figure was nearly identical to the roughly  3% rate in January , the last partial month of the Biden administration and first partial month of the second Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n   Inflation under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely claimed that President Joe “Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country” and that “I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said the US inflation  rate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022 , when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the  all-time record of 23.7% , set in 1920 — and, again, the rate then declined to about 3% in January 2025, the month Trump took over from Biden. Trump’s claim was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency. It was about 21%, compared with about 49% during President Jimmy Carter’s term.\n \n\n   \n   Investment in the US \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his frequent false claim that “we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now,” then said moments later that it is “more than $17 trillion right now.” This “$17 trillion” figure is fictional even without the “more than.” As of the time the “60 Minutes” interview aired on Sunday, the White House’s  own website  said the “major investment announcements” this term totaled “$8.9 trillion” — and a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges from foreign countries and companies, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges. You can read more  here .\n \n\n   \n   Who pays tariffs \n \n\n   \n  Trump claimed, as he often does, that China and other foreign countries pay the tariffs he has imposed on their exports. In reality, US importers, not China or other foreign countries, make the tariff payments to the US government, and they often pass on at least some of the costs to consumers;  study  after  study , including  one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission ,  found  that people and entities in the US bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on Chinese products.\n \n\n   \n   AI and power \n \n\n   \n  Trump correctly noted that some artificial intelligence companies are moving to  generate their own power  on the same sites as their energy-hungry data centers — but falsely added that letting companies make their own electricity “was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.” There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim that he came up with this idea. News articles last year, when Trump was an out-of-office candidate for president, discussed how AI companies were  already experimenting with on-site power generation  and how the Biden administration was on board with the idea; one article from April 2024, for example,  discussed  how the Energy Department was “exploring how energy-hungry tech firms might be able to host small nuclear plants on the campuses of their massive data centers.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign policy\n \n\n   \n   Strikes on alleged drug boats \n \n\n   \n  After Trump was asked about the recent US military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he said, “Every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs, and destroys families all over our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl, the drug involved in the highest number of US overdose deaths — the Caribbean is  not known  to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route — his “25,000” number does not make sense. The  total  number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional  federal data . Trump is essentially claiming, in other words, that  attacking 16 boats  prevented more than four years’ worth of American overdose deaths.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. “He’s claiming that he’s solved the overdose mortality crisis” with four boat strikes, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check  here .\n \n\n   \n   Trump and wars \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that he “knocked out eight wars,” adding, “I took eight wars and stopped (them) during an eight-month period” this presidency. Reading from a paper, he listed “Cambodia-Thailand,” “Kosovo-Serbia,” “the Congo and Rwanda,” “Pakistan and India,” “Israel and Iran,” “Egypt and Ethiopia,” “Armenia and Azerbaijan,” and “Israel and Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s “eight” figure is a clear exaggeration.\n \n\n   \n  There was no war between Egypt and Ethiopia for Trump to end; the two countries were in a long-running diplomatic dispute about a  major Ethiopian dam project  on a tributary of the Nile River, but that is not a war, and the dispute is  unresolved . Trump’s list includes  another supposed war that didn’t occur  during his presidency, between Kosovo and Serbia. (He has sometimes  claimed  to have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different from settling an actual war.) And the war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda  has continued  despite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year — which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting.\n \n\n   \n  One can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killing has  continued  in Gaza after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big.\n \n\n   \n   Biden and aid to Ukraine \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that “Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons.” The “$350 billion” figure isn’t close to accurate.\n \n\n   \n  The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response  says  the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closely  tracked  wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n    Immigration\n \n\n   \n   The shutdown, Democrats and immigrants \n \n\n   \n  Talking about the ongoing government shutdown, Trump said of Democrats, “I can’t give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally.” But that is not what Democrats are seeking.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are primarily proposing to reverse Trump-approved cuts to Medicaid and other health programs and to extend the enhanced pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Undocumented people are not eligible for either Obamacare subsidies or federal Medicaid insurance coverage (though hospitals are required to provide people with emergency care regardless of immigration status or ability to pay).\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s White House itself has  claimed  that Democrats are proposing to spend about $193 billion (not $1.5 trillion) on health care for “illegal immigrants and other non-citizens” and the White House published an itemized list that makes clear that even by its own contested calculations, the majority of even that smaller sum would be for these “other non-citizens” who are in the US legally.\n \n\n   \n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, has  estimated  that the spending proposal the Democrats released in September would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. But that figure is not about spending on undocumented people in particular.\n \n\n   \n   Foreign leaders, prisons and migration \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his regular claim that foreign countries are deliberately emptying their prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, at one point identifying Venezuela as a supposed culprit and at another point speaking more broadly — saying “very smart” foreign leaders “want people that are bad out” and so “what do they do? They open their jails, they let ‘em out. They get rid of their drug dealers, they let ‘em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren’t working. In other words, they have people that just don’t work. They don’t want people that just don’t work, so they put them into our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has never substantiated such claims, though he has been making them since his 2024 campaign. Experts on  international prison policy  and  crime in Venezuela  have told CNN they have seen no evidence of Venezuela or any other country emptying jails for migration purposes, let alone that these countries actively inserted former prisoners into the US.\n \n\n   \n   Migration under Biden \n \n\n   \n  Trump repeated his false claim that 25 million migrants were allowed into the country under Biden, though he was more tentative this time than usual, saying, “Probably, I say, 25 million people were let into our country. A lot of people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or — I believe I’m much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  The “25 million” figure is wildly inaccurate; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a  major exaggeration . Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had  recorded  under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection,  estimated  by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to Trump’s claim.\n \n\n   \n    Legal issues, impeachment and the 2020 election\n \n\n   \n   Previous presidents and the Insurrection Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke of the Insurrection Act, which gives the president sweeping powers to deploy troops to US states if certain vague conditions are met, and said, “Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? 28 times.” No president has invoked the act on more occasions than President Ulysses S. Grant’s six (after the Civil War in the 1800s), and no president has invoked it since President George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to  research published in 2022  by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In fact, the Insurrection Act and the similar laws that preceded it have been invoked on a  total  of 30 occasions in US history, the Brennan Center found.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said, “Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? Almost 50% of ‘em.” That’s at least a slight exaggeration.   Seventeen of the 45 presidents to date, so just under 38%, have invoked the act or its precursor laws, according to the Brennan Center.  You can read more  here .   \n \n\n   \n   Trump’s legal dispute with “60 Minutes” \n \n\n   \n  Trump discussed his  now-resolved  legal dispute with “60 Minutes” over an edit the show made to an October 2024 interview with his election opponent, then-Vice President Harris — and, as CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter  noted  Sunday, Trump falsely claimed this supposedly “election-changing” interview occurred “two nights before the election.”   The interview actually  happened on October 7, 2024 , four weeks and a day before Election Day on November 5, 2024.\n \n\n   \n  This wasn’t the first time Trump made the Harris interview sound closer to Election Day than it was. He falsely  claimed in June  that it occurred  “the day before the election.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Justice Department \n \n\n   \n  CBS’ O’Donnell noted  the recent indictments  of three targets of Trump criticism — former FBI Director James Comey, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James — and asked him whether he instructed the Justice Department to “go after them”; Trump responded, “No, and not in any way, shape or form. No.” But this is obviously false: he recently put  public  pressure on the Justice Department to go after Comey and James.\n \n\n   \n  Trump  wrote  in a September social media  post  directed to “Pam” — Attorney General Pam Bondi, the head of the Justice Department — that Comey, James and Schiff are “all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” that “we can’t delay any longer” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” (Trump intended the post to be a private message to Bondi, a source familiar with the matter told CNN after The Wall Street Journal first  reported  it.) Trump did not mention Bolton in that social media post; however, it’s worth noting he  previously made public calls  for his former adviser to be imprisoned over Bolton’s alleged inclusion of classified information in a memoir.\n \n\n   \n   A false story about Democrats and Trump’s first impeachment \n \n\n   \n  Trump delivered another version of a false story he  has told since 2019  about Democrats’ response to a phone call that year in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, who was his looming opponent in the 2020 election. This time, Trump said, “The Democrats knew that I wasn’t guilty, because they didn’t know the — the call was — I didn’t know either: The call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call — when they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, ‘You made me go into this mess.’ She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like (Democratic Rep. Adam) Schiff, etc., etc.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi could not possibly have been angry with Schiff or other allies after finding out the call was “taped” because, more than six years later, there is still no known US tape of the conversation; presidential calls with foreign leaders  are not typically recorded by the American side . In reality, the day after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry in September 2019, Trump’s White House released a  rough written transcript  of the call. There has never been any indication that seeing the rough transcript made Pelosi feel she had been deceived into the impeachment push; the day the document was released, Pelosi issued a  scathing statement  accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that a Trump story similar to the one he told on “60 Minutes” was “fact-free nonsense.”\n \n\n   \n   Trump and the Presidential Records Act \n \n\n   \n  Trump decried the  FBI search  of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022, during the investigation into his handling of classified documents after his presidency, and he brought back his false claim that the Presidential Records Act permitted him to possess these documents: “They took things that I was allowed to have … under the Presidential Records Act, that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have them.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s not true. The Presidential Records Act clearly says that all presidential records belong to the federal government  the moment the president leaves office . The  key sentence  from the law is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n \n\n   \n   Jason R. Baron , former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told CNN when Trump made such claims during the Biden administration: “Under the Presidential Records Act, not a single document pertaining to the official business of the White House — classified or unclassified — should have been carted off to Mar-A-Lago. President Trump might consider such records to be ‘his,’ but they are not.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Trump committed a criminal offense; the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and Trump was charged in 2023 for  allegedly violating other laws . (A judge appointed by Trump  dismissed the case  in 2024, declaring that the appointment of the special counsel who brought the charges violated the Constitution.) But Trump was,  again , wrongly describing what the act says.\n \n\n   \n   The 2020 election \n \n\n   \n  Trump uttered his regular lie that the 2020 election “was rigged and stolen,” saying at other moments of the interview that “this was a rigged election” and that “one thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden. Trump also falsely claimed, “And it’s been caught … and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it’s coming out now in spades.” Trump didn’t explain what he was talking about, but no election-rigging or widespread fraud has “been caught.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/november-snap-benefits-government-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00-04:00","title":"Trump Administration to Provide Half of Usual Food Stamp Benefits in November Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced it would provide only half of the usual Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for November 2025, citing a federal government shutdown and legal constraints on using contingency funds.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:02 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration said Monday that it will provide only half of the normal  food stamp benefits  for November by tapping into the program’s contingency fund amid the  government shutdown . But recipients are not likely to see the payments immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Some $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund will “be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households’ current allotments” for November, according to a  sworn statement  from a US Department of Agriculture official submitted in federal court. The remaining $600 million in the fund will be used for state administrative expenses and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after a federal judge in Rhode Island  ordered  the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  In court papers filed Monday, the administration said it decided against pulling $4 billion from other sources of money to provide full benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   Nearly 42 million Americans  receive food stamps, providing households just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s  unprecedented decision  to halt benefits has panicked many recipients, driving them to overwhelmed  food pantries  to help feed themselves and their families. Millions of SNAP recipients started missing their benefits on Saturday, and millions more could find themselves in the same situation over the course of the month, depending on when payments are made.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  Though the USDA will provide guidance on the partial payments to states on Monday, the agency noted that recipients in some states may not see their November benefits for weeks – or even months, Patrick Penn, the USDA official, told the court.   \n \n\n   \n  The partial payments will require states to reprogram their systems to adjust for the reduced allotments, which could prove complicated.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” Penn said.\n \n\n   \n  States  stopped the process  of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. The agency said that it does not have the funds to pay November’s assistance amid the federal government shutdown, which began October 1\n \n\n   \n  States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  Providing full benefits for November would be easier and faster, but Penn said the USDA decided against dipping into a pot of money meant to fund child nutrition programs to help cover that cost because it “would leave an unprecedented gap” in that funding source, which ordinarily provides free or low-cost meals for school children, among other things.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA has determined that creating a shortfall in Child Nutrition Program funds to fund one month of SNAP benefits is an unacceptable risk … because shifting $4 billion dollars to America’s SNAP population merely shifts the problem to millions of America’s low income children that receive their meals at school,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  That funding source, which consists of leftover tariff revenue, currently contains nearly $17 billion.\n \n\n   \n    Court rulings\n \n\n   \n  In his ruling last week, Judge John McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, gave the administration until 12 p.m. ET on Monday to say what it plans to do.\n \n\n   \n  A second federal judge, in Boston, issued a similar order last week, saying the agency was required to use SNAP’s contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Both judges said it was up to the agency’s discretion whether to access other money to enable it to provide full payments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA had maintained that it could not tap into its contingency fund, stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.” Also, it noted that the contingency funds are meant to pay food benefits in the case of natural disasters.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump indicated Friday evening that he wants benefits to resume,  posting  on Truth Social that he instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”\n \n\n   \n  “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump wrote. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration has opted to draw on the leftover tariff funds to fund other priorities. The USDA last month transferred  $300 million  from that pot in order to temporarily continue providing WIC food assistance for pregnant women, new moms and young children.\n \n\n   \n  The decision to halt benefits prompted a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, to file a lawsuit in Boston on Tuesday and a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to bring the case in Rhode Island on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case, said on Monday that it wasn’t satisfied with the administration’s decision to make only partial SNAP payments and that it is “considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It shouldn’t take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Rest assured, we will continue to fight so that people have the full benefits they are entitled to under SNAP.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/government-shutdown-snap-uncertainty","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:43:00-05:00","title":"Uncertainty persists for SNAP recipients, federal workers as shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown enters its fifth week, millions of Americans—including SNAP recipients and federal workers—are facing severe financial and emotional hardship.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Laterese Johnson has roughly a week and a half to two weeks of food benefits left to feed herself and her grandchildren, a reality that sunk in over the weekend when the government shutdown forced delays in payments for food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “With the amount of SNAP benefits that I receive, it’s just enough to feed one person, but I have to share that with my grandchildren,” she told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “You know, it’s already a sacrifice.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is one of millions of Americans, including food stamp recipients and federal workers, who are facing more uncertainty as the government shutdown enters its fifth week, with congressional Republicans and Democrats  remaining at odds  over a solution.\n \n\n   \n  While the Trump administration on Monday said it will provide partial food stamp benefits for November by tapping into the program’s contingency fund, recipients will not see payments immediately. In court papers, the administration said it decided against pulling from other sources of money to provide full SNAP benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after two judges ruled last week that the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds for the roughly 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Agriculture’s contingency fund doesn’t have enough money to cover the total cost of the payments, which 3 million recipients should have received November 1. Remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested there could be progress toward ending the shutdown after Election Day this week, claiming that Democrats believe ending the impasse could harm voter turnout in key races in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. His comments came days after President Donald Trump began  ramping up pressure  on the GOP to unilaterally end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster, a move Republican leaders  have opposed .\n \n\n   \n  Rachel Kent, a SNAP recipient, told CNN on Saturday that food should not be a political argument. “Congress can debate budgets all day, but you don’t debate whether children get to go to bed hungry,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The prolonged lapse in government funding continues to  stress food banks , charities and nonprofits set up to assist Americans in need, with federal workers going without pay also turning to those sources for aid.\n \n\n   \n  Nina Savransky, a former disaster response worker at the US Agency for International Development who volunteered at a food bank in the Washington, DC, area over the weekend, told CNN she was shocked to see the level of food insecurity brought on by the shutdown, particularly among federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I used to work in the disaster response bureau, and this is the disaster response now,” she told CNN. “It’s shocking to see this happen in the United States. This was support that we gave out to other countries that were unstable, and to feel that instability internally is … surprising. It’s difficult.”\n \n\n   \n     Food banks grapple with a surge in demand \n \n\n   \n  As the congressional stalemate persists, food banks across the county say the demand for their services is only rising and they will not be able to fill the gap made by delays to SNAP payments.\n \n\n   \n  “The potential is absolutely devastating, cataclysmic, in fact, for the whole nation, not only people experiencing hunger, but especially them,” Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, told CNN’s Jessica Dean on Saturday. “For every one meal that the charitable food system can provide, SNAP has been providing nine. That’s why I’m saying ‘cataclysmic.’”\n \n\n   \n  Cara Durr, CEO of Food Bank of Alaska, said her group’s partner organization was seeing a lot of “concern and anxiety” over SNAP disruptions over the past few weeks, and that many of the communities they serve were already rattled by Typhoon Halong,  which tore through  remote, coastal communities in the state last month.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re already seeing an increase. We expect that will continue,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are reeling from the effects of a prolonged shutdown as it drags into its second month. At a food bank just outside Washington, DC, over the weekend, some became emotional as they described to CNN how the  uncertainty of their pay  and employment status has taken a toll on their finances and mental health.\n \n\n   \n  Colby, a State Department employee of 21 years who declined to give his last name, said he never imagined he’d be in line for food. “It’s different. We’ve been volunteering here for a while — we live a few blocks away. And now we’re on the receiving end. I’m just thankful it’s here.”\n \n\n   \n  Janis, a federal worker who declined to give her last name, became emotional describing how the shutdown has upended things for her family.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big impact because now we have to choose either to feed ourselves or pay the bills,” said Janis, who did not want to disclose the agency she worked for.\n \n\n   \n  “We have young children, and we have to keep it together for them. It feels as if the government doesn’t care,” she said. “The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it.”\n \n\n   \n    Grocers brace for a hit\n \n\n   \n  The delays in food benefits are likely to affect not only recipients and the nonprofits that serve them, but could also lead to declining sales for grocers like Daweit Gebru, who co-owns Elmira Market with his brother in Washington, DC. He estimates that 60% to 65% of their business comes from customers using SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The market saw what was “possibly the worst time of business” last weekend, he said. Customers were more reluctant to spend money because of the shutdown, he said, and he and his brother were afraid to stock the market in case they didn’t sell anything. They forfeited part of their paychecks for the month to cover their staffs’ salaries and are now resorting to credit cards to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  At Zuppardo’s Family Market in Metairie, Louisiana, customer traffic remained steady over the weekend, according to owner Joseph Zuppardo. Louisiana’s Department of Health said it was moving forward with a state-funded program for SNAP households that include people who are elderly, disabled or children.\n \n\n   \n  The family-owned supermarket just outside of New Orleans has worked “extremely close under normal markups” to keep food affordable, according to Zuppardo. Long-term disruptions to SNAP could lead to as much as a 15% drop in sales, he said, adding, “we’re trying to do our part into lowering our costs.”\n \n\n   \n  At Joseph’s Market in Waterville, Maine, manager Sydney McKinnis said she is creating a November special priced under $150, potentially including basics like burgers, pork chops and bacon.\n \n\n   \n  McKinnis wants to keep it affordable “even if I have to go close to costs … just to be able to fill people’s freezers.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with the Trump administration’s plans to provide partial food benefits for November.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/portland-oregon-national-guard-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-05:00","title":"Federal judge extends order blocking Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge has extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, citing a lack of credible evidence that protests had reached a level requiring federal intervention.

National Guard troops to Portland \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:02 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A judge has extended her order blocking President Donald Trump from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, until Friday – keeping soldiers in the city in limbo as the legal showdown over presidential power continues.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Karin Immergut’s decision on Sunday followed a three-day trial that saw arguments over whether the Trump administration violated the law by federalizing and trying to deploy Oregon and California troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  The legal saga over the balance of presidential and state power has seen numerous twists and turns as it unfolded in both the district court and before appeals judges.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as the Trump administration faces challenges over its power to send National Guard troops into Democratic-led cities. A federal court last month  blocked the deployment  of National Guard troops in Chicago. And last week the  Supreme Court  took the rare step of asking for additional briefing in that high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  National Guard troops have been staging at Portland training bases for weeks while the legal case plays out, having been activated to protect federal officials and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been  the focal point  of daily protests since June.\n \n\n   \n  Federal attorneys have argued it’s within Trump’s presidential authority to respond to the daily protests outside the facility that have subjected the building and its agents to what it described as coordinated violence.\n \n\n   \n  But state and city attorneys called the move “one of the most significant infringements” on Oregon’s sovereignty in the state’s history and argued the Trump administration is dramatically misrepresenting the situation and risking inflaming tensions.\n \n\n   \n  The order from Immergut, a  Trump appointee  from his first term, says the federal government was unable to show the situation in Portland was out of control or federal officers were unable to do their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on the trial testimony, this Court finds no credible evidence that during the approximately two months before the President’s federalization order, protests grew out of control or involved more than isolated and sporadic instances of violent conduct that resulted in no serious injuries to federal personnel,” her order reads.\n \n\n   \n    Judge says protests do not justify a National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Immergut preliminarily   ruled the federal government’s deployment of the National Guard in Oregon exceeded its legal authority, violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty, did not meet the legal definition of a “rebellion,” and caused ongoing constitutional harm that justified immediate judicial intervention.\n \n\n   \n  She noted the trial testimony “included evidence of sporadic isolated instances of violent behavior toward federal officers and property damage to a single building,” but those incidents do not appear to be backed by an “organized group engaged in armed hostilities for the purpose of overtaking an instrumentality of government by unlawful or antidemocratic means.”\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of violence that did occur during this time period involved violence between protesters and counter-protesters and isolated sporadic incidents of low-level unlawful conduct,” the order read.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon has argued federal agents used “disproportionate” force against demonstrators, introducing surveillance video at the trial to support the claim.\n \n\n   \n  One exhibit appeared to show an agent running into a protester at full speed from behind and knocking the person to the ground. The August 13 video, provided to CNN by the Oregon Department of Justice, did not show the protester interacting with agents or any provocation immediately before being hit.\n \n\n   \n  Another video, from October 2, showed a protester who took a step across a line marking the ICE facility property immediately rushed by more than a dozen agents and taken into custody.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on those videos. A government attorney argued at  trial  that protesters have exhibited “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 250 arrests were made or citations issued against protesters at the ICE building between early June and mid-October, according to the  FBI  and  Portland Police Bureau . It is not clear how many of those taken into custody have been charged with a crime.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a separate  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  decision allowing Trump to deploy the Oregon National Guard troops to Portland is being reconsidered “en banc” by a broader 11-judge panel.  That case revolves around a now-frozen second order from Immergut that blocked the deployment of troops from Oregon. A date for the hearing was not set.\n \n\n   \n  While  400 soldiers  from Oregon and California together were federalized and sent to the greater Portland area, a Trump administration lawyer  said  in a previous hearing before the Ninth Circuit that the administration didn’t plan to deploy more than 200.\n \n\n   \n  Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued on September 28 after Trump declared he was sending National Guard troops to the city, and Immergut’s  two temporary orders  blocking those efforts closely followed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, the three-judge Ninth Circuit panel on October 20 issued a stay on Immergut’s first restraining order — a ruling that could have paved the way for a deployment as the legal battle played out. But the decision to have a new set of appeals judges rehear the case meant that the Trump administration was still barred from deploying troops.\n \n\n   \n    Insights and surprises from the trial\n \n\n   \n  The October trial Immergut presided over featured a surprising revelation: National Guard troops were on the ground at Portland’s ICE facility earlier last month even after the judge ordered them not to show up.\n \n\n   \n  Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.\n \n\n   \n  Hamilton argued it took time to implement the order. “My clients were working to end the mission,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The trial also provided insight on what federal and National Guard officials knew – and didn’t know – when Trump called for hundreds of troops to protect the ICE facility.\n \n\n   \n  Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, a deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying in court, R.C. stated he and his boss, the FPS regional director, were “surprised” by the order, which they had learned about on the news.   \n \n\n   \n  A fundamental disagreement from the trial was over how extreme the demonstrations were – and whether local law enforcement can handle them.\n \n\n   \n  State and city attorneys argued a simmering protest scene only ramped up after Trump ordered Guard troops to enter Portland in late September, and while there had been “sporadic and inexcusable crimes” along with peaceful protests, they were nothing existing law enforcement couldn’t handle.\n \n\n   \n  For months, the Trump administration has argued that federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters which justifies a more forceful response.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court. Protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence, he said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/donna-jean-godchaux-grateful-dead-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"15:11:00-05:00","title":"Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, Grateful Dead singer, dies at 78","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, a renowned mezzo-soprano singer and session performer, passed away at 78 after a battle with cancer at Alive Hospice in Nashville.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:19 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sequins? In November? Groundbreaking. Yes, when Salma Hayek, Doja Cat, Iris Law, Angela Bassett, Alex Consani, Emma Roberts, Vittoria Cerretti, Demi Moore, Kaia Gerber and her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford arrived at the LACMA Art+Film Gala on Saturday, each wearing a glitzy dress by Gucci — the official sponsor of the gala — it did for a moment feel like the label had made the most out of a closing down sale at the sequin wholesaler.\n \n\n   \n  But don’t write off this partywear trope too soon. It really is fashion’s great equalizer. Affordable, accessible and offered by many mass market brands — most women will have worn a sequin look in their life. Whether you dutifully fish your favorite out for an evening occasion this side of daylight savings, or just have fond memories wearing one on birthdays, holiday office parties or New Year’s Eve countdown’s gone by, there is something familiar about the high-shine iridescence of a sequin-covered frock that we can all relate to. That’s what makes it so endearing to see them on the 1% at red carpets.\n \n\n   \n  They were, however, once markers of extreme luxury. The first ‘sequin’ dates back to ancient Egypt, found by archeologists in Tutankhamun’s tomb around 1922. Small nuggets of gold had been hammered into round disks and sewn onto King Tut’s clothes to enable him to carry some of his wealth into the afterlife. In fact, most early sequins were sewn-on coins. Along with signalling affluence, clothes became wearable purses for travelers and attaching ones coins to a vest instead of carrying a bag was an easy way to avoid theft. Over the centuries, the gesture became more decorative and less about corporeal money management. A  portrait from 1620  of a well-to-do English woman named Margaret Layton, for example, shows her dressed in a dazzling embroidered jacket flecked with thousands of small sequins made from silver, gold and copper alloy. While it wasn’t the gold coins of King Tut, these precious metals feel unrecognizable compared to the shiny plastic disks we know today.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, the price tag of a Gucci sequin gown will probably bear more resemblance to Layton’s alloy embellished jacket. But at least these red carpet looks can be readily recreated at home. One complaint often leveled at luxury fashion is that it’s inaccessible, particularly in recent years: Prices were once aspirational, now they are  astronomical . Some designs, too, have been rooted in fantasy, as designers propose their wildest and most uninhibited visions on the catwalk. Sometimes, these ideas are diluted and trickle down into the prevailing trends of the day. Other times, they leave those outside the industry bubble feeling cold.\n \n\n   \n  But the sequin dress is easy-to-digest glamour. It’s simple yet effective, and pleasantly humble while still demanding attention. Plus, not every event requires 30,000  hand-embellished Swarovski crystals , or a one-of-a-kind archival designer gown. Sometimes all you really need, as Gucci reminded us, is a grab-and-go glittery frock that will do the work for you.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/sport/marathon-running-global-warming-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Why global warming could be ‘rewriting race history’ at major marathon events","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rising global temperatures due to climate change are increasingly making it difficult for elite athletes to perform at their best during major marathons.

\n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:47 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Runners already face a daunting challenge when they line up at the start of a  marathon , but they might increasingly find themselves with another obstacle to reckon with:  global warming .\n \n\n   \n  A  new study  claims that rising temperatures around the world will make it harder for elite athletes to break the marathon world record, or for recreational runners to hit their target times.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 221 races analyzed in the report from Climate Central released last week, 86% of them are less likely to have optimal racing conditions for runners by 2045.\n \n\n   \n  That includes last Sunday’s  New York City Marathon  and the other six major marathons around the world — London, Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston, and Sydney.\n \n\n   \n  For runners, the consequences of running in hot conditions can be extreme. \n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen time and time again where athletes are passing out from dehydration and heat exhaustion during races and taking months to recover,” Scottish distance runner Mhairi Maclennan told  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “It has really significant impacts on the thickness of your blood, on how quickly your body is able to recover, on your hydration levels for days, and also your ability to train after that kind of experience, which can then delay other achievements and goals that you’re pursuing.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the study, the optimal temperature for elite male marathon runners is 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) and 48 degrees F (9 degrees Celsius) for elite women.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Tokyo Marathon had a 69% chance of optimal race day temperatures for elite men, per the study, but those odds are expected to fall to 57% in 20 years. The Boston Marathon’s odds are expected to drop from 61% to 53% for the same category over the same time span, while London’s reduce from 22% to 17%.\n \n\n   \n  For elite women, the likelihood of optimal conditions is also anticipated to fall at five of the seven marathon majors by 2045, with the odds reduced by 10% and 11% or more at the Sydney and Berlin Marathons respectively.\n \n\n   \n  According to  data  from climate monitoring agency Copernicus, 2024 was the hottest year on record — 1.6 degrees Celsius warmer than the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels. It broke the previous record set in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Exercising in higher temperatures places  greater stress  on the body – especially in high humidity – and an athlete’s hydration strategy becomes even more crucial.\n \n\n   \n  During the Berlin Marathon in September, temperatures reached an unseasonably warm 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius), while the Tokyo and London Marathons saw temperatures rise above 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of this year’s race in Berlin, organizers  advised  that warmer temperatures would “make it harder to achieve personal bests” and told runners to “shift your focus away from chasing records and instead soak up the unique atmosphere along the course.” They also gave advice on hydration, cooling strategies, clothing and recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of the exceptional heat experienced at the 2025 Berlin and Tokyo Marathons pushed temperatures far beyond peak performance conditions,” said Maclennan, who was the highest-placed British woman at last year’s London Marathon with a time of 2:29:15.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s difficult because at the end of the day, sport is a business, and it generates revenue from spectators, and if spectators are there to see fast performances and that’s not happening because of climate change, that’s an issue for the sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Maclennan, who lives and trains in the often cold climes of Scotland, said that running in the heat “has and always will be a challenge for me.” She explained how elite athletes competing in hot conditions might undertake warm weather training camps, do workouts in heat chambers, or take saunas and hot baths straight after training to keep the body temperature high for longer periods.\n \n\n   \n  After heavy rain and flooding in New York City last week, the conditions were good for Sunday’s race, with more than 55,000 runners taking part. But should major marathons continue to take place in warm weather, then it might create a scheduling headache for organizers.\n \n\n   \n  “We have marathons in the spring and in the autumn in the northern hemisphere, because those are the times when we get the good, cool temperatures that you need for good running performance,” Andrew Pershing, who leads the Climate Central science team and worked on the new study, told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “As the climate warms, if you have a race that happens at the same week every year, that good climate is moving past you and it’s moving away. Those good conditions are becoming less and less frequent.”\n \n\n   \n  One solution for organizers might be to schedule earlier start time for races.\n \n\n   \n  An extreme example of that was the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, when the men’s and women’s marathons began at midnight local time to compensate for hot weather during the day. But even then, temperatures for the women’s race reached 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) with humidity at 77%.\n \n\n   \n  As Maclennan explained, athletes rarely have the luxury to choose when and where they compete, especially around events like the world championships and marathon majors.\n \n\n   \n  The 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, she said, might be another instance where athletes “probably have to do a lot of acclimatization,” adding: “The same is true for any competition where the environment is different to what you train in. There is consideration to be made into how you adapt and how you train your body to compete in those conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  The marathon world record has been broken several times on both the men’s and women’s side in recent years, though many attribute the faster times to advancements in  shoe technology .\n \n\n   \n   Ruth Chepngetich , who is currently serving a three-year doping ban, set the women’s record of 2:09:56 in Chicago last year, while the late  Kelvin Kiptum  set the men’s mark of 2:00:35 in 2023, also in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  But with global temperatures rising, athletes and climate experts alike anticipate that those kinds of performances might become more scarce in the future.\n \n\n   \n  “There are more marathons with worsening conditions, which is decreasing the overall opportunities for elite women to potentially break records,” said Maclennan. “Overall, that, I guess, reduces the quality of the product … I do think that heat waves are already rewriting race history.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/europe/drones-spotted-belgian-airbase-spying-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-05:00","title":"Drones Spotted Above Belgian Airbase Were ‘Spying’ on Military Planes, Defense Minister Says","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Drones were spotted flying over Belgium’s Kleine-Brogel Air Base, where they were allegedly spying on military fighter jets, including F-16s, and possibly sensitive nuclear-related assets.

time when European nations are on high alert for airspace intrusions.\n \n\n   \n  “They come to spy, to see where the F-16s are, where the munitions are, and other highly strategic things,” Theo Francken told CNN affiliate RTBF.\n \n\n   \n  The drones were clearly “spying,” the minister said, noting the “long time” one of them had spent over the airbase.\n \n\n   \n  Kleine-Brogel Air Base, in the municipality of Peer, hosts the largest unit of Belgian defense forces in the country and aims to “fundamentally contribute to NATO’s nuclear deterrence strategy,” according to its website. Local media reports have long rumoured the presence of US nuclear weapons at the site.\n \n\n   \n  Belgium’s Ministry of Defense told CNN it cannot confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons at the base. When asked for comment, NATO referred CNN to the Belgian authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The latest sightings come as Europe is on high alert after recent incursions by drones and aircraft into NATO airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The airbase is home to F-16 fighter jets, the airbase’s website said, adding that these are set to be replaced by “ultramodern” F-35s within “a few years.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of the latest sightings, Francken said that Russia is “trying to do this in all European countries” but stopped short of directly pinning the blame on Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Is it the Russians now? I cannot say that, but the motives are clear,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Francken posted on X that three reports had been received the previous night of drones above Kleine-Brogel. The drones were of “a larger type and flying at higher altitude,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He stressed that they were not just flying over Kleine-Brogel, but were clearly monitoring the airbase.\n \n\n   \n  “A drone jammer was used, but without success … A helicopter and police vehicles chased the drone, but lost it after several kilometers,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The most recent sightings follow other reports of drones above Kleine-Brogel earlier on Saturday. Those sightings kicked off an investigation, with Francken declaring that it is “strictly forbidden to fly drones above military areas.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Lithuania  closed its border  with Belarus following “constant violations” of its airspace, the country’s foreign ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Belgian defense officials also reported that an  unspecified number  of drones flew over the country’s Elsenborn military base and toward the border with Germany.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/paddington-the-musical-bear-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-05:00","title":"Paddington the Musical brings beloved bear to life on stage","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the successful staging of 'Paddington the Musical' in London, which brings the beloved character Paddington Bear to life through a unique dual-actor performance.

Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, they say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water resources.\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Trump threatened to stop all US aid to Nigeria if its government fails to take steps to stop the killings of Christians. He warned that the proposed intervention would be “fast and vicious,” aimed at eliminating the “Islamic Terrorists” he said were responsible for these atrocities.\n \n\n   \n    Is Trump correct about a mass slaughter of Christians in Nigeria?\n \n\n   \n  As Trump’s war threats echo among Nigerians, his assertion that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” has provoked strong reactions from many within the country.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has nearly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims, with the northern region predominantly Muslim and the southern region largely Christian.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, the Islamist group Boko Haram  issued an ultimatum , ordering Christians in the northern region to leave while calling on Muslims in the south to “come back” to the north.\n \n\n   \n  John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country’s northern region, where attacks by Islamist groups are prevalent, told CNN that he agrees with Trump’s claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area. However, he added, “there has been a little shift in the last two years,” with the scale of the killings reducing.\n \n\n   \n  Hayab said he had presided over numerous mass burials of slain Christians, stating that “every state in northern Nigeria has suffered its own terrible share of killings targeting Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  He urged the Nigerian government to acknowledge the issue and take measures to correct the killings rather than deny them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have raised this matter dozens of times, but nobody hears us,” he claimed, acknowledging the role of US Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in bringing attention to reports of alleged Christian persecution in Nigeria.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Republican senator  introduced a bill  calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Some analysts argue that while Christians have been targeted by Boko Haram and other Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law, Muslims, including those considered moderate, have also been victims of those groups.\n \n\n   \n  Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development, disputed Trump’s comments, telling CNN that they “reflect a dangerous oversimplification of Nigeria’s complex security crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  He stated: “The claim that there is a ‘mass slaughter of Christians’ by ‘Islamic radicals’ distorts the reality on the ground and risks deepening divisions in a country already under immense strain.”\n \n\n   \n    High profile killings in predominantly Christian areas draw international attention\n \n\n   \n  Northern Nigeria has witnessed horrific killings targeting religious groups this year. In April, gunmen believed to be Muslim herders,  killed at least 40 people , including children, in a predominantly Christian farming village, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Two months later, more than 100 people were massacred by attackers in Yelwata, a largely Christian community in Benue state, also in the north-central,  according  to Amnesty International.\n \n\n   \n  Pope Leo XIV offered prayers for the victims of the Yelwata attack, many of whom were “internally displaced persons sheltered by a local Catholic mission,” a  Vatican news report  said.\n \n\n   \n  Outside the northern region, such targeted killings are rare. A  a mass shooting at a church in Owo , a community in southwestern Nigeria, left dozens dead in 2022. Court filings  seen by Reuters  linked the suspects in the Owo massacre to al-Shabaab, a militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda operating in East Africa.\n \n\n   \n  Muslims have also been victims of targeted killings this year. In August,  at least 50 worshippers were killed  — some shot, others burned alive — when gunmen attacked a mosque in the north-western Katsina State, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  Many similarly brutal attacks have been carried out in Muslim communities by Boko Haram and other armed groups in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north.\n \n\n   \n  “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims,” Bukarti said. He noted that “the groups’ attacks on other civilian locations such as markets, bus stops and refugee camps (disproportionately) harm Muslims,” as the states where the radical groups operate are predominantly Muslim.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Trump’s rhetoric (suggesting a mass slaughter of Christians) not only misinforms the international community but also risks fuelling extremist propaganda and undermining local efforts to build peace,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    What does the data reveal?\n \n\n   \n  Claims that Christians are being disproportionately targeted by extremists in Nigeria are not supported by what little data is available.\n \n\n   \n  Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, a crisis-monitoring group,  reported  that more than 20,400 civilians were killed in attacks in Nigeria between January 2020 and September of this year. Among those casualties, 317 deaths were attributed to attacks targeting Christians, while 417 deaths were reported among Muslims, though the organization did not include the religious affiliation of the vast majority of the civilians killed.\n \n\n   \n  Security analyst Nnamdi Obasi, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, explained that while extremist groups have wreaked havoc against both Christians and Muslims in the northeast of Nigeria, bandit groups have terrorized predominantly Muslim communities in the northwest. Additionally, predominantly Christian farming communities in parts of the North Central zone have suffered persistent violence from armed groups.\n \n\n   \n  However, “in most parts of the country, Christians and Muslims live peacefully with each other,” he said. “Reports of widespread persecution and mass slaughter of Christians are seriously misread and exaggerate the challenges of interfaith relations in the country.”\n \n\n   \n  Ken Eluma Asogwa, a spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told CNN that “even though the government of Nigeria has been lackluster and shambolic in its approach to the protection of its citizens from murderous non-state actors operating under different aliases, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claims that Christians are particularly targeted for extermination.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US  International Religious Freedom Act . The label is a suggestion that his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”\n \n\n   \n  Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has so far remained silent about Trump’s mention of potential military intervention but pushed back against the designation, stating in a social media  post  that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.”\n \n\n   \n    Would US military action be likely to stop the killings?\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not ruled out the possibility of sending US troops to Nigeria or launching airstrikes in the country, telling reporters on Sunday, “I envisage a lot of things.”\n \n\n   \n  But analyst Obasi said that any unilateral US military operation against Islamist groups in Nigeria would not address the underlying factors driving instability there.\n \n\n   \n  Such an intervention, he said, “without the involvement of Nigerian security forces, would be predictably unwelcome by many Nigerians and could further destabilize the country, aggravating its security situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Instead, he urged the Nigerian government to “intensify efforts to end the mass killings of citizens,” regardless of their religious or other identities, and to address religious extremism, tensions over resources and banditry, “which are the underlying drivers of most of the mass killings.”\n \n\n   \n  Bulama, the human rights advocate, believes the Nigerian government can address Trump’s criticism by “moving beyond defensiveness.”\n \n\n   \n  “It should meet misinformation with data,” he suggested, adding that “this moment calls for candor, not posturing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Constructive dialogue, not social-media outrage, will best serve Nigeria’s interests — and the cause of peace,” he advised.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/climate/antarctic-glacier-hektoria-rapid-melt-sea-level","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:05:00-04:00","title":"Antarctic Glacier Saw the Fastest Retreat in Modern History; It Could Spell Trouble for Sea Levels, Report Finds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Nature Geoscience reveals that the Hektoria Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula retreated by 5 miles between November and December 2022 — the fastest retreat ever recorded in modern history.

CNN\n \n   \n  An  Antarctic glacier  shrunk by nearly 50% in just two months, the fastest retreat recorded in modern history, according to a new study — and the way it retreated could have big implications for  global sea level rise .\n \n\n   \n  The Hektoria Glacier, roughly the size of Philadelphia, is on the Antarctic Peninsula, a spindly chain of mountains sticking off the continent like a thumb pointing toward South America. It is  one of the fastest warming regions  on Earth.\n \n\n   \n  Grounded glaciers like Hektoria, which rest on the seabed and don’t float, generally retreat no more than a few hundred meters a year. But between November and December 2022, Hektoria   retreated by 5 miles, according to the  study  published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n \n\n   \n  “This is astonishing; the rate of retreat is just crazy,” said Ted Scambos, a study author and senior research scientist for the Earth Science and Observation Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n \n\n   \n  Understanding more about why this happened is vital; if larger glaciers retreat at similar rates, it could have “catastrophic implications for sea level rise,” the authors wrote in a statement accompanying the report. Antarctica holds enough ice to raise   global sea level by  around 190 feet .\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s near demise was discovered by chance. Researchers had been surveying the bay where it’s located for a separate study. They were keeping a close eye on the area’s “fast ice” — sea ice fastened to land that doesn’t move with the wind or tides — believing it was about to break off and float out to sea.\n \n\n   \n  As Naomi Ochwat, a study co-author and postdoctoral associate at the University of Colorado Boulder, pored over the data, she noticed Hektoria had lost an enormous amount of ice over a very short period. “I realized that, OK, something special is going on here,” Ochwat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She and her co-authors started to dig into what was happening, looking at satellite images and data from flyovers.\n \n\n   \n  They identified several steps that led﻿   to Hektoria’s rapid retreat. In 2011, the bay filled with fast ice, stabilizing the glaciers around it, allowing them to advance into the bay and form thick, floating ice tongues. In 2022, this fast ice broke out of the bay, destabilizing the glaciers, causing them to lose their ice tongues and retreat.\n \n\n   \n  The reason Hektoria fell apart much faster than its neighboring glaciers is due to what lies beneath it, the scientists found.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria rests on an ice plain, where sliding ice glides over flat sediment on the seabed. Ice plains can prompt fast retreat because as the glacier thins, the ice starts to rise up and water pushes underneath into its crevasses, exerting pressure and causing large slabs to break off — in a process called calving.\n \n\n   \n  As one iceberg calves, it exposes the glacier behind it to the same pressures and calving happens again. Scambos likens the process to “dominoes toppling backwards, their feet slipping out from under them, one after the other.”\n \n\n   \n  This kind of ice plain melting has happened before. Models show that between about 15,000 and 19,000 years ago, during a period of warming that ended the last Ice Age, glaciers with ice plains retreated hundreds of meters a day. But “we hadn’t seen it play out live before, certainly not at this rate,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria’s retreat   was heavily influenced by climate change, she added. The loss of sea ice in the ocean next to Hektoria, believed to have been driven by ocean warmth,   allowed wave swells to reach the fast ice and break it up, leaving the glacier exposed to ocean forces.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, “we are likely to see more reductions of sea ice in this region,” said Bethan Davies, a glacial geologist at Newcastle University who was not involved in the study. This could result in other glaciers losing the sea ice that currently buttresses them, she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Hektoria is a relatively small glacier by Antarctic standards, and its partial demise won’t cost the planet much in terms of sea level rise, Scambos said.\n \n\n   \n  However, “it’s a smaller cousin to some truly gigantic — I mean size of the island of Britain — glaciers in Antarctica that could conceivably go through the same process, as this whole evolution of the ice sheets on Earth evolves with global warming,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The next stage is to better establish which areas in Antarctica are vulnerable to the same process. If a huge glacier were to disintegrate quickly, “it means that we might have a step   change in sea level rise,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the research, said the new findings “raise the bar on our understanding of how fast Antarctic glaciers may retreat.”\n \n\n   \n  These glaciers, especially the cavities beneath their ice shelves and tongues, are some of the most inaccessible environments on Earth, he told CNN, but knowing more about them is crucial to better project how they’ll respond to climate change. The research raises fears that ice loss from Antarctica, which contributes to sea-level rise, “could occur more rapidly than projected,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s yet another sign humanity still has a lot to learn about this vast, isolated continent. “We’re in a position where we’re still uncovering processes that we didn’t know about,” Ochwat said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:39:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has directed five states and Washington, D.C. to verify the immigration status of Medicaid enrollees, resulting in over 170,000 names being reviewed.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:39 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has ordered states to investigate certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they are ineligible because of their immigration status, with five states reporting they’ve together received more than 170,000 names collectively — an “unprecedented” step by the federal government that ensnares the state-federal health program in the president’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates say the push burdens states with duplicative verification checks and could lead people to lose coverage just for missing paperwork deadlines. But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  Several states disputed Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Medicaid officials blasted Oz’s comments.\n \n\n   \n  “Once again, the Trump administration is spreading misinformation about standard uses of Medicaid dollars,” said Illinois Medicaid spokesperson Melissa Kula. “This is not a reality show, and there is no conspiracy to circumvent federal law and provide ineligible individuals with Medicaid coverage. Dr. Oz should stop pushing conspiracy theories and focus on improving health care for the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Washington State Health Care Authority, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, was also blunt.\n \n\n   \n  “The numbers Dr. Oz posted on social media today are inaccurate,” said spokesperson Rachelle Alongi. “We were very surprised to see Dr. Oz’s post, especially considering we continue to work with CMS in good faith to answer their questions and clear up any confusion.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.\n \n\n   \n  “We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”\n \n\n   \n  Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.\n \n\n   \n  In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”\n \n\n   \n  The states Oz mentioned all  run their own  such programs.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/justice-department-election-monitors","dateOfPublication":"1003-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-04:00","title":"What to know about Justice Department election monitors","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has dispatched federal election monitors to polling locations in New Jersey and California, two states with politically significant off-year elections.

federal voting rights laws may have been violated.\n \n\n   \n  But this year is different, some experts say, in part because the election monitors are being deployed after requests from local

They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors are tasked with making sure that federal voting rights laws are being followed, including the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.\n \n\n   \n  While they may sound imposing, federal monitors are not there to enforce laws. Monitors are allowed only to observe and take notes. They can’t talk to voters or poll workers, don’t have access to voting machines or ballots and are not involved in tallying votes.\n \n\n   \n  The monitors typically remain outside polling places and enter only with permission from local election officials.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not to become part of the story. You’re not even supposed to fix problems,” David Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney who now runs the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told CNN. “You’re just supposed to take notes.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters may not even be aware that federal monitors are present, Becker said, noting that political parties and individual campaigns often send their own monitors as well.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2024 presidential election, monitors were sent to 27 states. For the 2022 midterms, the DOJ monitors were in 24 states. And in 2020, during President Donald Trump’s first term, the department sent monitors to 18 states.\n \n\n   \n     Why are people concerned this year? \n \n\n   \n  While the dispatching of federal election monitors is routine, their targets this year have amplified concerns from critics who say the Justice Department is using federal law to promote Trump’s personal agenda.\n \n\n   \n  Becker, who was a federal monitor during several elections, told CNN it is highly unusual for the Justice Department to monitor polling places for “ballot security,” a description the department gave in a  press release  last month, as the DOJ typically watches for compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\n \n\n   \n  Compounding concerns is that both states have high-profile races — New Jersey is home to a  race for governor , while voters in California are  deciding whether  to redraw congressional maps to create five Democratic-friendly seats.\n \n\n   \n  California’s redistricting effort is part of a nationwide scramble by political parties to gain the upper hand in next year’s midterm elections for the US House. Trump instigated the redistricting battle by pushing Republicans in Texas to  draw five additional seats  to benefit Republicans in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  After it was announced that monitors would be sent to California, Gov. Gavin Newsom  claimed  the Justice Department’s move was aimed at suppressing votes in the state. Earlier last month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state would deploy its own observers to monitor the attorneys dispatched by the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t need evidence of irregularities. I simply need a basis to believe that it would be helpful for the DOJ to be there, and that’s it,” Harmeet Dhillon, who runs the department’s Civil Rights Division,  told CNN ’s Elex Michaelson. “We are not there to interfere. We are there to observe. We are there to document.”\n \n\n   \n  But the department has so far taken at least one highly unusual move: sending Dhillon’s deputy, Michael Gates, a high-ranking political appointee, to be one of two monitors in Orange County, California.\n \n\n   \n  Gates is the former city attorney of Huntington Beach, California, and has been a vigorous proponent of voter identification laws. He also has been among the Justice Department officials seeking voter roll data from individual states — a move that has caused alarm among some state election chiefs who argue it amounts to federal overreach in elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If they want to come, it’s fine,” Bob Page, Orange County’s registrar of voters, told CNN. “Everything we do is transparent.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/mad-honey-deli-bal-turkey-black-sea","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:35:00-05:00","title":"Mad Honey: The World’s Rarest and Most Dangerous Honey","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mad honey, known as 'deli bal' in Turkey, is a rare and naturally toxic honey produced only in two regions of the world: Turkey’s Black Sea region, particularly in the Kaçkar mountains, and Nepal’s Hindu Kush Himalayan range.

found in two places in the world. It’s strong enough to fell bears and soldiers \n       \n  By Maureen O'Hare, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:35 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the little wooden hut perched high on metal-wrapped stilts, the drone is high, loud and insistent.\n \n\n   \n  With his beekeeping suit on, but hands uncovered,  Hasan Kutluata   squeezes the bellows on his pine-filled bee smoker. Pale wreaths swirl in the air, mirroring the mist that drifts over the slopes of the densely forested Kaçkar mountains outside.\n \n\n   \n  The smoke is to calm the bees, masking the pheromone they release when they sense danger and which warns other bees to attack.\n \n\n   \n  When Kutluata lifts the lid off the round lindenwood hives, the hum rises to a crescendo — but these bees aren’t angry, it’s just their honey that’s mad.\n \n\n   \n  We’re here to harvest  deli bal  —  bal  means “honey” and  deli  means “crazy” or “mad” — and Turkey’s Black Sea region is one of only two places in the world to produce it, the other being Nepal’s Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range.\n \n\n   \n  “In our untouched forests, the purple rhododendron blooms in spring,” Kutluata tells CNN. “The bees collect nectar from those flowers, and that’s how we get the mad honey.”\n \n\n   \n  The nectar contains a naturally occurring toxin called grayanotoxin. The amount that makes it into the honey varies per season and what other flowers the bees have been feasting on, but a spoonful can pack enough buzz to deliver a gently soporific high — while a jar would land you in a hospital.\n \n\n   \n  For millennia,  deli bal  has been used as folk medicine, a spoonful taken daily to lower blood pressure or used as a sexual stimulant. Today, this potentially dangerous delicacy sells at a premium price.\n \n\n   \n    The honey that defeated an army\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata uses a knife to carefully extract comb from the hive, the sticky elixir dripping thick and sweet as he gathers it in a bucket.\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is a dark amber red and its scent is sharp. The taste is earthy with subtle barnyard notes. There are telltale sensations that announce the presence of grayanotoxin: A herbal bitterness underlies the sweetness of the honey and a burning heat catches the back of the throat.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s honey has all the signs. “We shouldn’t eat too much. If we eat more, it might affect us,” says Kutluata. “There’s no hallucination involved. It just causes dizziness, low blood pressure, a slight fever, nausea, and difficulty walking.”\n \n\n   \n  No more than a teaspoon or tablespoon is recommended. “We have to be careful while consuming this honey,” says Kutluata. “Too much of anything is harmful. And too much honey is harmful as well.”\n \n\n   \n  This is a food that has felled armies. In the 4th century BCE, the Greek military leader  Xenophon  wrote of soldiers traveling near Trabzon on the Black Sea coast who overindulged on the sweet treat: “Not one of them could stand up, but those who had eaten a little were like people exceedingly drunk, while those who had eaten a great deal seemed like crazy, or even, in some cases, dying men. So they lay there in great numbers as though the army had suffered a defeat, and great despondency prevailed.”\n \n\n   \n    Exit, pursued by a bear\n \n\n   \n  “That’s enough for today; the bees are starting to attack,” says Kutluata, “Let’s slowly head down now.”\n \n\n   \n  Once we’re back on solid ground, the ladder goes back up to the hut so no more climbing can be done. The enemy this mini-fortress is warded against isn’t Greek armies, but honey-crazed bears.\n \n\n   \n  The metal around the poles is to prevent bears digging their claws in, and the platform’s height, some 10 feet off the ground, is to stop momma bear throwing her cub up to get the honey she can’t reach.\n \n\n   \n  Kutluata is viscerally aware of the dangers. Some 20 years after an attack, he still has scars on his hand and leg from when he fought off a bear which had raided his hives and got into a  deli bal  stupor.\n \n\n   \n  The apparently sleeping bear had roused when Kutluata and his friends approached and the ensuing chase and struggle landed Kutluata in intensive care for more than a week.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether we’re afraid of bears or not, we have to do this work,” he says. “We will continue beekeeping. We encounter bears almost every day. Whenever we go up the mountain, we come across a bear.”\n \n\n   \n  When dangerous doses of  dali bal  aren’t involved, however, “the bear doesn’t attack us. The bear runs away from us, and we run away from the bear.”\n \n\n   \n    Village of the bees\n \n\n   \n  We hop in the truck and rattle down the winding mountain tracks to Kutluata’s family home near the village of Yaylacılar, not far from Arili Köyü — the aptly named “village of the bees.”\n \n\n   \n  His parents, wife and son join us for lunch; they’re a beekeeping family of three generations. The table is set under the eaves of the traditionally styled house, with its uninhabited lower floor stacked with box beehives.\n \n\n   \n  “Our village is very cool. Summers are very cool here. There are no mosquitoes. It’s not like the city, where it’s too hot to stay,” says Kutluata. “Here, it’s a natural life. We have a river; we can go swimming. There’s no noise here.”\n \n\n   \n  The purity of the environment contributes to the quality of the honey, says his wife Emine. “What makes us different is the nature, the altitude, and the absence of settlements. That plays a huge role in the production process.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  is just one of the honeys the family cultivates. After the purple rhododendron, the white chestnut flower blooms. After that, the white rhododendron is in flower.\n \n\n   \n  In summer, if the weather isn’t rainy, Kutluata’s bees can fill up a hive in about 20 days.\n \n\n   \n  “The longer the honey stays in the hive, the higher its quality becomes. The quality is determined by the promille value,” he explains. Promille refers to the concentration of the honey. “The higher the promille value, the higher the quality.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chestnut honey can be found everywhere, but it really makes a difference,” adds Emine. “In terms of the promille value, it can be 600, 700, 800, but elsewhere, it might be 500 in terms of quality.”\n \n\n   \n    Breakfast of champions\n \n\n   \n  Honey is a breakfast staple in Turkish homes and the Kutluatas show us how they mix it with butter and spread it on bread, for a hearty and high-energy start to the day.\n \n\n   \n  The food’s properties as a natural antibiotic have long been  documented ; it’s one of the world’s oldest medicines.\n \n\n   \n  To Emine, honey “represents health. If my throat is sore, I turn to honey. If I’m coughing, I turn to honey. If I’m feeling weak, I turn to honey again.”\n \n\n   \n  And to Kutluata, the bees themselves are restorative for mental health. “When I’m feeling down, I go to the bees. When I’m stressed or feeling troubled from work or the outside world, I go to the bees,” he says. “I open the hive, take care of them, and I feel peaceful and happy. And all my stress and troubles disappear.”\n \n\n   \n   Deli bal  can be sold legally in Turkey and is legal in many countries. However, the US Food and Drug Administration does not recommend its consumption.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers should check labeling of honey to ensure it is not labeled as ‘mad honey’ or marketed for intoxicating qualities,” an FDA spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Eating honey with a high amount of this toxin can lead to ‘mad honey’ poisoning, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. This type of poisoning is rare.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/pammukale-hot-springs-turkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:22:00-05:00","title":"The Magical White Stone Wonderland with Effervescent Bathing Pools","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pamukkale, a stunning natural wonder in southwestern Turkey, features white travertine terraces formed by geothermal water that sometimes emerges at boiling point.

In fact the water it’s formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point.\n \n\n   \n  And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren’t going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle — and either paddle or soak in some of the planet’s most photogenic pools.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale’s travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink.\n \n\n   \n    Gateway to Hell\n \n\n   \n  But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in busloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it’s worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground.\n \n\n   \n  Enter from the South Gate — tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) — and it’s easy to be initially underwhelmed. There’s not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey.\n \n\n   \n  In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better.\n \n\n   \n  After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know what’s coming, there’s still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed.\n \n\n   \n  Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name — Pamukkale means “cotton castle” in Turkish.\n \n\n   \n  These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by.\n \n\n   \n  “It is pretty, but there’s not as much water as I’d expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. “The view is gorgeous though.”\n \n\n   \n    Serene pools\n \n\n   \n  There’s still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It’s a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties.\n \n\n   \n  To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesn’t take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment.\n \n\n   \n  The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, there’s every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves.\n \n\n   \n  DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the country’s stunning landscapes, he declares: “I love Pamukkale the best.”\n \n\n   \n  For a more complete spa experience, there’s the Antique Pool, about five minutes’ walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo.\n \n\n   \n  Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles — it’s like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions.\n \n\n   \n    Noxious fumes\n \n\n   \n  You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis – high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis.\n \n\n   \n  The size of the site reveals the city’s one-time power and popularity (it even rates a  namecheck in the Bible  alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis’ status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface.\n \n\n   \n  While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell.\n \n\n   \n  Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath.\n \n\n   \n  Today, the Plutonium — located between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater — is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated.\n \n\n   \n  While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area.\n \n\n   \n  Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer.\n \n\n   \n  Pammukale’s  UNESCO listing  led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray.\n \n\n   \n  “If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says.\n \n\n   \n  He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground.\n \n\n   \n  About 20 minutes’ drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice.\n \n\n   \n  Farther away, in Buharkent — its name meaning “steam city” — water at boiling point powers what was Turkey’s first geothermal power station.\n \n\n   \n  In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it’s always a hot destination.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/americas/venezuelans-economic-fears-us-military-action-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:59:00-05:00","title":"For many Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Venezuela, the daily struggles of ordinary citizens — such as Samuel Carreño caring for his mother after a medical emergency and facing extreme water and financial shortages — have taken precedence over fears of US military action.

Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:59 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The daily routine of Samuel Carreño has turned upside down since the end of August.\n \n\n   \n  That was around the time Donald Trump ordered  warships to the southern Caribbean  in what the US president said was a mission against drug trafficking, unleashing a wave of geopolitical tensions that have kept the region on edge ever since.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not the US warships — or Caracas’ suspicions that Washington is more interested in deposing Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  — that are weighing on the mind of the 49-year-old resident of Petare, Venezuela. It’s a more pressing, personal issue: how to pay the bills.\n \n\n   \n  That same week in August, his mother Tita Carreño, 75, had an accident at home and fractured her left femur, leaving her son no option but to stop working and care for her.\n \n\n   \n  Like millions of Venezuelans, Samuel Carreño is an informal worker who lives day by day — “killing tigers,” as the local slang goes. A medical emergency is simply impossible for him to afford.\n \n\n   \n  “For the operation they were asking us for US$3,000, and we had to ask for help,” Carreño said. Thankfully, his brother managed to get that price lowered through a personal contact, and following a collection among the family, Tita was operated on 30 days later.\n \n\n   \n  But Carreño still cannot leave the house because he has to care for his bedridden mother. Every day, so she can bathe, he heats water in buckets on a gas stove because his home, where five people live, does not have a water heater. He must also be careful how much he uses because, due in part to its poor infrastructure, Venezuela rations water. Carreño’s home receives running water only three days a week when he can fill up a dozen buckets.\n \n\n   \n     It’s the economy, stupid \n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, like Carreño, the daily ordeal of normal life in the country is a far more pressing concern than speculative headlines about  whether the US will or will not attack .\n \n\n   \n  According to the Central Bank, in the two months that US warships have been in the Caribbean — the same period in which Tita Carreño has been bedridden — the Venezuelan bolivar depreciated by 50% against the dollar, as people sought a safe haven in the foreign currency.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the average income of around $250 per month does not even cover half the cost of the basic food basket in the country — and the official minimum wage is just 130 bolivars per month (less than 70 cents), according to the Central Bank.\n \n\n   \n  While the Maduro government is supplementing salaries and public pensions with what it calls an “economic war bonus” (a reference to US sanctions on the country) of between $80 and $100, that doesn’t go far in a country that, according to the International Monetary Fund, has the highest inflation rate in the world: 270% for 2025 and projected to surpass 680% in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  “The issue of shopping is very limited by a budgetary deficiency: You buy what you can, and rarely can you stock up,” said economist Jesús Palacios, a professor at Venezuela’s Andrés Bello Catholic University.\n \n\n   \n     Hard to speak out \n \n\n   \n  While many Venezuelans are open about their economic concerns, gauging their feelings in response to the US military deployment is far harder. The country has a history of censorship and political oppression that makes many people wary of commenting publicly.\n \n\n   \n  One sign that censorship is increasing came Tuesday, when Maduro ordered authorities to adapt a mobile phone app currently used to report failures in public services, so that people could use it to inform on other citizens voicing dissent against the government.\n \n\n   \n  Sharing such opinions in Venezuela can be very costly.\n \n\n   \n  On October 8, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello announced the arrest on Margarita Island of photographer Carlos Lesma, who was accused of writing “welcome to the gringos” on social media sites in reference to the possibility of a US military invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Lesma is one of more than 750 Venezuelans imprisoned for political reasons, according to the latest count by the   human-rights organization Foro Penal — though the Venezuelan government has repeatedly denied that these detentions are arbitrary.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 100 foreign prisoners are also believed to be held for political reasons, according to Foro Penal.\n \n\n   \n  One of the most striking of these cases is that of Jonathan Torres, a 25-year-old Venezuelan citizen who emigrated in 2015 as a minor to settle in the United States with his family. He returned to Venezuela last year by land.\n \n\n   \n  According to Torres’ mother and lawyers, he was detained in October 2024 and held incommunicado before being brought before the courts on charges of terrorism, criminal association and treason.\n \n\n   \n  But they believe the real reason for his detention is that the Maduro regime wants to use him as a bargaining chip with Washington. His mother, Rhoda Torres, first learned he was being held when another US citizen detained in Venezuela, David Estrella, was released alongside five others earlier this year following high-level negotiations between the White House and Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “They wanted to exchange him, just like all the other gringos. When they realized he wasn’t from the US and that they messed up, they still kept him there because he could be used in a swap,” Rhoda Torres told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out the Venezuelan Attorney General’s Office for information about Torres’ case and has not received a response.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the risks, Rhoda Torres campaigns openly for her son’s release, sharing videos on social media that have been watched tens of thousands of times.\n \n\n   \n  “They say not to publicize the cases, that you have to be careful, but it’s a lie: Notoriety is our only defense,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of other political detainees are often more fearful and agree to speak only on the condition of anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  “Having a family member as a political prisoner is hell,” said another woman, whose nephew has been held since September 2023, according to a document reviewed by CNN. He has not been brought before a court or charged, lawyers and relatives said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she is afraid of what would happen if the Venezuelan government were overthrown by force, the detainee’s aunt said: “Afraid of what? Sooner or later a war will end, while for me the fear is to be here forever, or for our allied countries to leave us alone in the fight.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/igaza-deceased-hostages-return-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:27:00-05:00","title":"Israel receives remains of 3 more deceased hostages held in Gaza","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has received the remains of three deceased hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including Omer Neutra, a 21-year-old Israeli-American dual national and IDF tank platoon commander, Col.

Tidmarsh then resigned Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,” Hilliard said.\n \n\n   \n  The departure came the same day that a drugmaker connected to one of Tidmarsh’s former business associates filed a lawsuit alleging that he made “false and defamatory statements,” during his time at the FDA.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, brought by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, alleges that Tidmarsh used his FDA position to pursue a “longstanding personal vendetta” against the chair of the company’s board of directors, Kevin Tang.\n \n\n   \n  Tang previously served as a board member of several drugmakers where Tidmarsh was an executive, including La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and was involved in his ouster from those leadership positions, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Messages placed to Tidmarsh and his lawyer were not immediately returned late Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh founded and led a series of pharmaceutical companies over several decades working in California’s pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Before joining the FDA, he also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was recruited to join the agency over the summer after meeting with FDA Commissioner  Marty Makary .\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh’s ouster is the latest in a string of haphazard leadership changes at the agency, which has been rocked for months by firings, departures and controversial decisions on  vaccines ,  fluoride  and  other products .\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Vinay Prasad, who oversees FDA’s vaccine and biologics center, resigned in July after coming under fire from conservative activists close to President Donald Trump, only to rejoin the agency two weeks later at the behest of Health Secretary  Robert F. Kennedy Jr .\n \n\n   \n  The FDA’s drug center, which Tidmarsh oversaw, has lost more than 1,000 staffers over the past year to layoffs or resignations, according to agency figures. The center is the largest division of the FDA and is responsible for the review, safety and quality control of prescription and over-the-counter medicines.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Tidmarsh drew public attention for a highly unusual post on LinkedIn stating that one of Aurinia Pharmaceutical’s products, a kidney drug, had “not been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients.” It’s very unusual for an FDA regulator to single out individual companies and products in public comments online.\n \n\n   \n  According to the company’s lawsuit, Aurinia’s stock dropped 20% shortly after the post, wiping out more than $350 million in shareholder value.\n \n\n   \n  Tidmarsh later deleted the LinkedIn post and said he had posted it in his personal capacity, not as an FDA official.\n \n\n   \n  Aurinia’s lawsuit also alleges, among other things, that Tidmarsh used his post at FDA to target a type of thyroid drug made by another company, American Laboratories, where Tang also serves as board chair.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and “to set the record straight,” according to the company.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/sport/nfl-wrap-week-9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-04:00","title":"A wild finish in Cincy, a star player’s gruesome injury and multiple games come down to the final seconds in NFL’s Week 9","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season, multiple games ended in dramatic fashion, including a stunning comeback by the Cincinnati Bengals that was undone by a final-minute touchdown by Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.

And in the day’s most anticipated matchup, the Buffalo Bills survived a last-gasp effort from the Kansas City Chiefs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n     Bears make an incredible last-minute comeback \n \n\n   \n  The script flipped a few times in Cincinnati on Sunday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago Bears led by two touchdowns with five minutes left in the game, another seeming disappointment for the Bengals on home turf. Bengals quarterback Joe Flacco found Noah Fant for a 23-yard touchdown pass with 1:43 to go, and then Cincy converted on the two-point conversion attempt to pull within six points.\n \n\n   \n  The Bengals then lined up for a desperation onside kick and, thanks to the slightest of touches off a Bears player’s foot, managed to recover the ball to get possession back.\n \n\n   \n  Flacco again drove his team down the field and, with 54 seconds to play, hit Andrei Iosivas for a 9-yard touchdown pass. The Bengals converted the extra point and suddenly had the lead with less than a minute to go. An incredible comeback had Paycor Stadium rocking in disbelief.\n \n\n   \n  A few moments later, it would be silenced as that disbelief turned to shock.\n \n\n   \n  Bears quarterback Caleb Williams hit tight end Colston Loveland with a pass and the tight end barely evaded two Bengals defenders, who hit each other instead of Loveland. To the dismay of the home fans, Loveland scampered 58 yards for a touchdown, stealing the lead – and the game – back for the Bears with just 17 seconds to play. The Bears won 47-42.\n \n\n   \n     Josh Allen and the Bills outduel the Chiefs \n \n\n   \n  In a matchup of two of the game’s brightest stars, Bills quarterback Josh Allen bested Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs in the weekend’s highest-profile game, winning 28-21.\n \n\n   \n  Allen had an extremely efficient performance, going 23-for-26 and passing for 273 yards, passing for one touchdown and running for two more. James Cook III put in a strong game for the Bills on the ground, running for 114 yards, and Dalton Kincaid led the way for the team’s receivers with six catches for 101 yards and one touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  The Bills got ahead early and stayed in front, holding off a late charge from the Chiefs. Kareem Hunt ran in a 1-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to cut the Bills’ lead to seven, and the Chiefs had the ball last with a chance to tie. Ultimately, Mahomes’ Hail Mary pass was batted away by Buffalo defenders.\n \n\n   \n     Minnesota defeats the Lions in NFC North clash \n \n\n   \n  The Minnesota Vikings got their franchise quarterback back on the field on Sunday and J.J. McCarthy showed why the team bet on him this offseason.\n \n\n   \n  McCarthy’s stat line wasn’t that impressive – 14-for-25 passing for 143 yards, two touchdowns and an interception – but the second-year man from Michigan showed incredible moxie to navigate a tricky away game against the two-time defending division champions.\n \n\n   \n  The key play came in the final minutes after the Jared Goff hit Jameson Williams for a touchdown to bring the Lions back within three points. Needing a first down to seal the game, McCarthy found Jalen Nailor for a 16-yard gain to convert on a high-pressure third down that allowed the Vikings to take a knee and run out the rest of the clock.\n \n\n   \n  The 27-24 victory for the Vikings reinvigorates their season in the incredibly tight NFC North. All four teams – Minnesota, Detroit, Green Bay and Chicago – are all separated by less than two games.\n \n\n   \n     Washington’s star quarterback injured again in loss \n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders entered this season looking like one of the league’s new powers after their run to the NFC championship game last season behind quarterback Jayden Daniels.\n \n\n   \n  Those hopes have gone up in smoke this year.\n \n\n   \n  Daniels had already missed multiple games this year with a left knee sprain and right hamstring sprain, and now it appears he’s going to be on the shelf for a significant amount of time. The second-year quarterback was injured in the fourth quarter when his left arm buckled underneath him as he was being tackled by a Seattle Seahawks defender, a gruesome injury that’s being called a dislocated elbow by the team.\n \n\n   \n  The game was already well out of hand that point after the Seahawks scored four touchdowns in the first half to take a 28-0 lead. The Commanders never really got back into it, and the game finished 38-14.\n \n\n   \n    Cam Little’s record field goal and last-second wins\n \n\n   \n  There have been only six field goals of 64 or more yards in NFL history, and three have come this season. On Sunday, Cam Little had the longest one of all time.\n \n\n   \n  The Jaguars’ kicker was good from 68 yards at the end of the first half in Jacksonville’s 30-29 overtime win against the Las Vegas Raiders. Not only was it the longest field goal made in NFL history – but he also cleared the distance with room to spare.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, two visiting teams stole wins from their hosts on field goals as time expired.\n \n\n   \n  The Carolina Panthers defeated the Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field on a 49-yard field goal by Ryan Fitzpatrick as time run out for a 16-13 win in a disappointing showing for the Packers.\n \n\n   \n  The Denver Broncos rallied in the second half to defeat the Houston Texans, 18-15. The Texans lost quarterback C.J. Stroud early in the contest when he took a big hit in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  Will Lutz kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired for the winning points.\n \n\n   \n  There was also one missed kick that ended up sealing a game this weekend. The Atlanta Falcons fell on the road to the New England Patriots, 24-23. The Falcons looked to have tied the game up in the fourth quarter with less than five minutes to go on Drake London’s third touchdown catch of the game but Parker Romo missed the extra point. It would prove to be the deciding margin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-jim-curtis-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"Jennifer Aniston goes Instagram-official with boyfriend Jim Curtis","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jennifer Aniston has officially announced her romantic relationship with mental health advocate Jim Curtis on Instagram, marking her first public relationship since her 2018 divorce from Justin Theroux.

Mamdani is a 34-year-old democratic socialist, the Uganda-born son of a university professor and filmmaker, who sprung to stardom with a focus on cost of living conveyed in buzzy, multilingual videos pushing for government to pay for more.\n \n\n   \n  This isn’t a sitcom pitch: It reflects   a party still deep in figuring out what it’s supposed to be and how it’s supposed to appeal to voters.\n \n\n   \n  Heading into Tuesday’s elections, Democrats are far from resolving the schism between progressives and moderates that  undermined them in last year’s presidential race . But many in the party are fearful of being tied to Mamdani’s  democratic socialism  or  anti-Israel views  even as they buzz about his  breakthrough communications  and the passion he has inspired.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger is clear about her differences with Mamdani. She spoke to CNN on Friday on her campaign bus, leaving   an event in Ashland, Virginia, where the woman who introduced her said sometimes she feels she’s the only Democrat in the area.\n \n\n   \n  “Why is it that everybody keeps thinking somebody running in a city, admittedly an enormous city, that  that  is the deciding race?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  When asked what she made of Mamdani declaring at an  October rally in Manhattan  that he had already won the battle over the soul of the Democratic Party, Spanberger’s mouth twitched into a smile.\n \n\n   \n  “Then maybe,” she said, “he should be a Democrat.”\n \n\n   \n  Acknowledging when pressed that Mamdani is in fact the Democratic nominee, Spanberger said that for all the talk — including from within the  Democratic Socialists of America itself  — about the DSA’s growing power, she doesn’t see democratic socialism on the rise.\n \n\n   \n  She argues there’s a level of dishonesty in some of the big promises Mamdani is making that she worries could hurt Democrats with voters long term, saying the reason she doesn’t have a Mamdani-style proposal for  government-run grocery stores  is “because I couldn’t ever pass it.”\n \n\n   \n  “People do want us to be aspirational and dream big. They also don’t want us to lie to them,” she told CNN. “When you have a party that makes promise after promise, and then say, ‘Oh, we passed it in the House, it’s not our fault’ — vulnerable people believed you. Maybe he is going to get Albany on board with totally refinancing public transportation. But there’s a lot of people who believe him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign did not respond when asked about Spanberger’s comments. But asked at an event on Friday about whether he wants Democrats to have room for more moderate campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey, where US Rep. Mikie Sherrill is running with a similar approach to Spanberger’s, Mamdani was conciliatory.\n \n\n   \n  “Absolutely, I think that this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,” he said. “To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger argued that many polls show her more likely to break 50% in her state than Mamdani is in his city.\n \n\n   \n  She’s facing a Republican who  failed to win Trump’s endorsement  and who faced GOP criticism over her campaign. He’s in a three-way race, but Mamdani and his close advisers are focused on the 50% mark themselves —for what kind of mandate he’ll be able to claim both for his agenda and the broader direction he wants to set for the party.\n \n\n   \n    Can both visions co-exist?\n \n\n   \n  Mayoral races in New York don’t usually have national implications. That was before the shocker out of this year’s primary as Mamdani went from 1% in the polls to knocking off former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his political comeback. Now New York City has the marquee race, with Mamdani trying to consolidate Democrats and defeat Cuomo’s independent run appealing to Trump supporters and moderates.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, is the only Democrat known to be considering a 2028 run who’s campaigned with Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani, as well as supporters of the Democratic-led redistricting effort in California.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s mind-boggling to me that we don’t have more people recognizing” the importance of how much Mamdani has electrified young voters and beyond, Khanna told CNN. He added that he hopes national Democrats also recognize how Spanberger pitched herself to rural counties and Sherrill to the suburbs.\n \n\n   \n  They fit together, Khanna said, in that Democrats are “rejecting the status quo and saying we need a fresh generation of leaders and saying, ‘We’re not going to define our identity around Donald Trump.’”\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic leaders plotting next year’s campaigns say Mamdani won’t be their blueprint.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters in the Arizonas or the Iowas aren’t thinking about who the mayor of New York might be. They’re thinking about who’s going to understand the issues facing our community and going to fight to make a difference back in Washington, DC,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington state congresswoman and chair of the House Democrats’ campaign arm. “It is hard to draw conclusions from a bright blue city versus look at what it’s like in purple districts where you have just that huge diversity, in terms of points of view and different issues.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether she’s thought about New York City as she looks at this year’s gubernatorial contests and the 36 races looming next year, Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper told CNN, “Not really.”\n \n\n   \n  “I understand why there’s attention on it — but at a moment when our party’s struggling and our brand is struggling, if you want to be a party that wins, gets results and is popular in the eyes of voters, you should look to Democratic governors,” Meehan-Draper said.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill —  a personal friend  of Spanberger’s who keeps up with her on the campaign trail via text — tends to respond to questions about Mamdani by pointing out that she won her own primary by a big margin with a field that included candidates closer aligned to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “New Jerseyans want competence — they want someone who is going to attack prices, someone who is listening to their concerns,” she told CNN’s John Berman recently.\n \n\n   \n  And when CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries whether he thought Mamdani was the future of the party, the New York Democrat responded, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s response to Jeffries hours later: “That’s good to know.”\n \n\n   \n    Spanberger crafts her own blueprint\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s mode isn’t Mamdani’s big-smile charisma. She knows that her buttons and T-shirts haven’t become a political fashion statement. But she says she’s tired of people saying she’s not exciting. Along with Sherrill, she helped flip the US House to Democratic control during Trump’s first term. She got bills signed by Joe Biden and Donald Trump — “that is not easy to do,” Obama joked while  rallying for her  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A year after some panicked Democrats declared after Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump that women can’t win, operatives beyond New York have joked that maybe the answer is just slightly younger women who are moms and, given Spanberger’s CIA work and Sherrill’s time as a Navy   helicopter pilot, were maybe involved with killing some people.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger laughed at that suggestion, but said what people read into her biography helped her tap into a moment with parallels to when she first won in the post-Trump midterms — but with key differences.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t even call it the resistance anymore. People have matured in their advocacy,” she said, arguing that while 2017 was defined by protests of a growing base nearly every weekend, now there are clearer, starker stakes and “layers of people who were not anywhere in play in ’17, who are in some cases leading the charges in their communities to make differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani and his aides say that feeling of people left out of politics for so long is exactly what he’s tapping into.\n \n\n   \n  “Too long we’ve been told that we should wait,” he said Saturday in Queens, but “to wait would be to trust who gave us this moment, who delivered us to it.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of why Mamdani and his advisers bristle so much at those who write him off as a great campaigner with a great production team.\n \n\n   \n  “The style is downstream from the substance,” Andrew Epstein, his communications director through the primary and now his digital director, told CNN in an earlier interview. “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives, that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics, it’s not going to work.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Ruben Gallego, who ran well ahead of Harris last year in his swing state of Arizona to win his seat, said he felt comfortable campaigning just for Spanberger and Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think Mamdani could win in Arizona, I don’t think I could win New York City, but it doesn’t mean that some of this stuff is also wrong. He cares about the cost of living like many of us; we just take different approaches to it,” Gallego told CNN after finishing speaking at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria for Spanberger.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats “have always been that way,” Gallego said. “Look at the Republicans, look at those weirdos, man. They have a weird span of things.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/europe/louvre-heist-petty-criminals-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"06:49:00-05:00","title":"Louvre heist suspects are local petty criminals, Paris prosecutor says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Four suspects, including three men and one woman, have been arrested in connection with a high-profile heist at the Louvre museum’s Apollo Gallery on October 19, 2025.

But none of the political stakes compare to the misery of millions of Americans now struggling to get by on $0 paychecks, or who risk losing health care or vital food assistance.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels as if the government doesn’t care. The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it,” Janis, a federal worker, who is the daughter and granddaughter of military veterans, told CNN’s Camila DeChalus at  a food bank in suburban Maryland .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seems oblivious to political appearances or the risk that the shutdown could further damage him among most Americans who have soured on his second term. Creating an impression of gilded indifference, he hosted a “Great Gatsby”-themed  Halloween party  at his luxury Florida club and  boasted about  the swish renovation of a bathroom at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  In a combative interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump showed no sign of looking for a way out that did not involve a total defeat for Democrats, whom he described as “crazed lunatics.” He said the opposition party would eventually “have to” capitulate and vote to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  The president has complicated GOP calculations by  renewing demands  for reluctant Senate Republicans to shatter  the chamber’s filibuster rule  to reopen the government with a simple majority vote. GOP leaders fear this would embolden a future Democratic majority.\n \n\n   \n  “The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not going to lose power,” Trump said on “60 Minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s embittered politics, which set the stage for the Washington shutdown disaster, will take a fresh twist with a handful of  key elections Tuesday , which could help resolve the impasse. Or perhaps they’ll just deepen the morass.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will deliver the first major verdict on Trump’s second term in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats lead in the polls. The New York mayor’s race could enshrine democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as an electric new talent in a party split between wariness of his politics and enthusiasm over his youth. A victory for Mamdani over the old guard of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo would also hand a new foil to Trump, who paints the 34-year-old as the far-left face of his rival party.\n \n\n   \n  In California, meanwhile, voters will decide whether to redraw the congressional map to  favor Democrats in a clutch of seats , in response to Trump’s similar moves  in Texas and elsewhere  ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Their endorsement would be a huge boost for  California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is claiming a national leadership role ahead of a likely run for president in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  The elections and the deepening pain over the shutdown, set off on October 1 by Senate Democrats in a bid to force Republicans to  extend Obamacare subsidies , will play out against the daily backdrop of chaos and extremes of the second Trump era. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will  hear arguments  over Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs that started a global trade war. The justices’ eventual decision could set up a showdown with the executive branch or confirm Trump’s claim of emergency powers in yet another vast expansion of presidential authority.\n \n\n   \n  The same underlying question — of whether Trump is illegally acting on powers he’s not granted by the Constitution — underpins an escalating crisis over the administration’s strikes against what it claims are drug traffickers’ boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Critics accuse the administration of carrying out extrajudicial killings and breaking the law by acting without congressional consent. The White House has offered no proof or justification to the American people for its actions, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned subordinates from  discussing the strikes with Congress  without prior approval.\n \n\n   \n  There were new signs Monday that Trump’s approach in his wild second presidency is backfiring. A new CNN/SSRS poll found the president’s approval rating is at 37%, the lowest level of his second term so far. And the country is in a sour mood, which might benefit Democrats if only they could settle on a message that has public appeal. In the poll, 68% of people say things are going badly in the country, while 72% say the economy is in poor shape.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown misery deepens as record approaches\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, pressure on both parties to end the shutdown is becoming visceral.\n \n\n   \n  The reality of rising health care premiums for those with Affordable Care Act policies struck home with  the start of open enrollment Saturday . Premiums were already set to rise significantly because of the costs of care and drugs. But the expiration of subsidies means prices are shooting out of the reach of many policyholders. This is why Democrats sought to use the only leverage they had in Washington — the ability to block most legislation in the Senate — to force a showdown to coerce Republicans into action.\n \n\n   \n  “We want to make sure that we can decisively address the Republican health care crisis, which is crushing people all across the country,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  If the dispute was only about health care, Democrats might have  claimed victory  by now.\n \n\n   \n  But by closing the government, they precipitated the furloughing of millions of federal employees as others were forced to work without pay. This has led to  the potential cutoff of food stamps  to more than 40 million people and is disrupting air travel  as Thanksgiving looms .\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accuse Trump of withholding emergency funding they say could partially finance food stamps for this month, claims that have been validated by several federal judges.\n \n\n   \n  But the extreme disruption and costs of the shutdown are scrambling normal political calculations and may mean no party earns a clear-cut win. “It’s very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,” Jeffries told Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that the broader deprivation caused by the shutdown would not have occurred had Democrats agreed to GOP demands to reopen the government ahead of talks on Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how they can believe they’re winning, if it were indeed a game to them,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The Louisiana Republican said Trump was “desperate” to reopen the government and had offered negotiations. The sticking point, however, is the Republican demand for the government to reopen so talks can happen — and the Democrat belief that such offers cannot be trusted.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he was ready to fix the Obamacare subsidies problem. “We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,” he said. “All they have to do is let the country open and we’ll fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  But the president, as has been the case across his two terms, did not lay out any detailed plan for making health care more affordable.\n \n\n   \n    Senators still seeking off-ramp\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic and Republican senators have been speaking informally about a device to fund the government in the short term. But Trump’s demands to eradicate the filibuster suggest he’s got no plans to back down. This hints at what is different in this shutdown. The president has proved that he’s ready to impose pain on anyone to fulfill his political goals and that the normal logic of shutdown politics may not apply. While Democratic voters are demanding their party shows backbone against Trump, their leaders must work out a way to create an off-ramp that would allow them to claim victory.\n \n\n   \n  Warning signs are also mounting for Trump and Republicans. New polls show that the Democrats’ top demand — extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — is popular. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll Thursday, voters blamed Trump and the GOP more than Democrats for the shutdown by 45%-33%. The president’s approval rating is only 41% in the  CNN Poll of Polls  average.\n \n\n   \n  But public disdain for Democrats is complicating the party’s effort to exploit Trump’s troubles. Some 68% of people in the Post poll thought the party was out of touch with most Americans. And a CBS News poll found 56% disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, while 55% said the same of how congressional Democrats and Republicans are responding to the situation.\n \n\n   \n  One warning sign for Democrats is that they are being effectively forced by Trump’s hardline tactics to balance the pain of citizens who risk losing health care against the suffering of those who could lose nutrition benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman wants to reopen the government so health care and food assistance crises can be addressed. “I fully, fully support these things, but this is the wrong tactic,” Fetterman said on “State of the Union.”\n \n\n   \n  “And right now, by doing this, our government shut down, we’re getting neither of those things, and they guarantee neither you’re going to get your SNAP benefits, and you’re not going to get those kind of tax credits that we all need,” Fetterman continued. “Reopen this thing, and we can find a way forward.”\n \n\n   \n    How will Tuesday’s election shift shutdown drama?\n \n\n   \n  One intriguing question this week would be whether a Democratic sweep in New Jersey, Virginia, New York and the California redistricting initiative would reshape Republican shutdown tactics. Republicans might panic only a year ahead of the midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson, who will lose his job as speaker if Democrats win back the House next year, insisted on Sunday that the impasse could end because the opposition party would no longer need to use it as an issue as voters make their decisions. “We do have a sense that something may change next week,” he told the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit during a virtual appearance Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But a rank-and-file Republican warned Sunday his party must make health care more affordable once the government is reopened. “The midterms are going to be a whole lot harder if Republicans just sit there and say, ‘We’re just going to let it (the enhanced subsidies) lapse. We’re not going to do anything,’” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of living has shaped campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s elections, along with Trump’s perceived excesses. “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington,” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in New Jersey branded GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli as a tool of Trump. But outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is also unpopular, and  Ciattarelli called for change  in a state that has sometimes chosen GOP governors.\n \n\n   \n   Former President Barack Obama  on Saturday campaigned in both states, confirming his status as one of the few A-list national Democrats — but also the party’s desperate need to find new voices.\n \n\n   \n  He told voters in Norfolk, Virginia, that the stakes were clear. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"As Trump awaits an early verdict with Tuesday’s elections, next year’s midterms are already on his mind","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is deeply focused on the 2026 midterm elections, expressing bewilderment at the historical pattern of his party losing in mid-term races.

Tuesday’s elections, next year’s midterms are already on his mind \n       \n  By Jeff Zeleny, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Even as Tuesday’s elections hang in the balance,  President Donald Trump  has bluntly suggested that he is already looking ahead to the 2026 midterm races with a sense of dread.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had success like nobody, but for some reason, you lose the midterms,” Trump said late last month at the White House, waxing aloud about the political backlash that most presidents face during midterm elections. “I don’t know why. It doesn’t make sense.”\n \n\n   \n  A year after winning back the White House, the first big electoral test of Trump’s second term  is taking shape in marquee elections  on Tuesday, when Virginia and New Jersey will elect governors, California will vote on a pivotal ballot measure to redraw its congressional maps, and New York City will pick its next mayor.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a chance for some voters to deliver a verdict on the actions of the new Trump administration. While hardly a perfect indicator,  the results could offer clues  about the political climate heading into next year’s elections, when voters will determine control of Congress for the rest of Trump’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to win the midterms,” Trump said as he addressed Senate Republicans during a lunch in the Rose Garden. “Otherwise, all of the things that we’ve done, so many of them, are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics. I mean, we’re going to end up with a communist mayor in New York. Can you believe it?”\n \n\n   \n  As Trump has repeatedly made clear, the race for New York City mayor  has been on his mind  far more than any of the other races being decided Tuesday. He frequently disparages the positions of Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed  democratic socialist , who is well on his way to becoming the newest foil for Republicans as Democrats seek to rebuild their party.\n \n\n   \n  The president has followed the other contests to varying degrees, aides say, asking for more updates in the closing days and directing some campaign funds to help voter turnout efforts.   He fully endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in New Jersey, but  stopped short  of doing the same in Virginia, where Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP candidate, is seen as less competitive.\n \n\n   \n  “People like me there,” Trump said of New Jersey, a state where he owns golf courses and spends considerable time in the summers. “It’s typically not Republican, but turning Republican very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  That assessment will be tested in the contest between Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made  significant gains in New Jersey  last fall — losing by 6 points to Kamala Harris, compared with a resounding 16-point defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 — but Democrats still hold considerable structural advantages, including a voter registration edge on Republicans of more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, a government shutdown entering a second month  hangs particularly heavy over the election , with hundreds of thousands of federal workers, active-duty military and government contractors living in the state. Trump also made gains in Virginia in 2024, but still fell short to Harris by 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has held a consistent lead over Earle-Sears, which is among the reasons that Trump’s aides say he has not become more involved. He called into a tele-rally on Thursday night in hopes of boosting turnout for the Republican ticket. He is scheduled to give a final push Monday night from the Oval Office when he holds a telephone pep rally in Virginia and New Jersey to fire up GOP voters.\n \n\n   \n  In the final days of the campaign, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida — far away from both states. Former President Barack Obama visited Virginia and New Jersey  to rally the Democratic base  and highlight the stakes of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said Saturday night in Newark. “Every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain old craziness.”\n \n\n   \n    The Trump effect\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win their races in Virginia and New Jersey, the outcome could offer a window into some of the headwinds facing Trump and Republicans going into next year’s elections. Yet if Republicans win — or deliver a split verdict — it may suggest that Democrats have misjudged how much of a liability Trump could pose to his party.\n \n\n   \n  “If you get a flat tire on the way home today, she’s going to blame President Trump,” Ciattarelli tells supporters of Sherrill at most every campaign stop, hoping to make light of Democratic finger-pointing at Trump. “There’s nothing she won’t blame on the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are seeking to ride an early wave of voter discontent, hoping to deal a political setback to Trump a year after his historic return to power. In his first term, Democrats won the races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey in 2017 before going on to take control of the House the following year in a sweeping victory.\n \n\n   \n  The White House is working hard to avoid a replay of that scenario.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the driving force behind  a redistricting arms race  playing out across the country. After Texas drew new congressional lines that could add up to five Republican seats in the House, California responded with the ballot initiative to redraw districts to favor Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina and Missouri have already followed the president’s call to squeeze more Republican seats by redrawing congressional districts, while efforts are underway to follow suit in other GOP-led states such as Indiana and Kansas, where political and procedural obstacles remain. Democrats in Virginia  gave approval Friday  to a proposed constitutional amendment to do the same, while some party leaders in Illinois are exploring possible changes to the state’s map.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an unprecedented mid-decade gerrymandering effort — akin to changing the rules in the middle of the game — that started with an order from the Oval Office. Trump still fumes about the investigations and impeachment proceedings that played out during the second half of his first term after Democrats won control of the House.\n \n\n   \n  “The president is obsessively focused on the midterms,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. “He remembers what happened the first time he was in office.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Everything’s about Trump’\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s name, of course, is not actually on Tuesday’s ballot. If it was, Republican strategists say they would feel far more bullish about rebuilding a Trump coalition that could provide a stronger path to victory.\n \n\n   \n  He figures prominently into the strategies of both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are counting on a disdain for the president and an objection to his policies to help energize and unify their base. Republicans are working overtime to motivate those who love Trump, paying extra attention to voters with shaky attendance records in off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to send a message to Washington,” said Neil Wintfeld, a Virginia Democratic voter who dropped by a Spanberger rally in Alexandria during the closing days of the race. “President Trump generates a lot of negative enthusiasm and motivates people to react to the destruction he is visiting upon our institutions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sharon Cox, a Republican who voted for Trump in each of his three presidential bids, said she was tired of politicians of all stripes invoking the president’s name in elections.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s about Trump, it seems,” Cox said after casting an early ballot in Hampton, Virginia. “I know everybody’s not going to like Trump. I know everybody’s not going to like somebody on the Democratic side, but the hate has to go before our country can move forward.”\n \n\n   \n  While the lessons of these elections can be overstated, there is little question the results of Virginia and New Jersey will be analyzed — at least in part — through a Trump-colored lens, given how he is  already laser-focused  on the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a great presidency, it only makes sense that you win the midterms,” Trump said in his Rose Garden remarks, expressing his bafflement that only twice in nearly a century has the president’s party not lost House seats in a midterm election. “There might be some dark, deep psychological reason where they want to vote the opposite way. I don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/autism-inclusive-communities-conversation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"How autism rates are rising – and why that could lead to more inclusive communities","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Autism diagnosis rates in the U.S. have risen from 1 in 36 to 1 in 31 children by age 8, according to CDC data from 2025, driven by improved diagnostic criteria, greater societal acceptance, and increased awareness.

to more inclusive communities \n       \n  By Joshua Anbar, The Conversation\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  I can say from personal experience that being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder can feel very isolating. Increasingly, however, it’s not unusual.\n \n\n   \n  In the U.S.,  1 in 31 children are diagnosed with autism  each year by age 8, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number, released in April 2025, is up from 1 in 36 in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  These statistics have been  widely characterized as concerning . But I would like to offer a different perspective.\n \n\n   \n  I am a researcher studying how young people with autism  transition to adulthood . I also work on the  Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network , which was established by the CDC two decades ago to determine the prevalence of autism in the U.S. and which produced the 2025 report.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, this topic is  deeply personal  to me, since I am diagnosed with  Asperger’s syndrome, now known as autism spectrum disorder .\n \n\n   \n  While autism does present challenges, my professional and personal experiences have taught me that creating space for autistic people’s perspectives affords opportunities for  making the world a more vibrant place .\n \n\n   \n    A rare condition?\n \n\n   \n  Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental condition that manifests differently from person to person but commonly affects how a person  communicates, socializes and interacts with the world .\n \n\n   \n  In the 1990s, researchers and clinicians estimated that autism was a relatively rare condition,  affecting an estimated 1 in 500 children . But the real-world experiences of families and clinicians suggested that it was  more common .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Autism charities can portray autistic people as helpless and a burden – our research shows why it matters \n \n\n   \n  In a landmark study published in 1998, researchers examined autism prevalence in a community in New Jersey to determine a more realistic estimate in the U.S. population. They found that approximately  1 in 150 children had autism  – making it more than three times more common than previously believed.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in 2000, the newly formed Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which set out to study autism among 8-year-olds, looked across a much broader population and  confirmed the higher prevalence .\n \n\n   \n    A growing recognition\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the number of children recognized as having autism by a doctor or an education specialist has continued to rise. The 2025 report shows that  autism occurs in all types of communities . Autism affects children regardless of race, ethnicity or income level.\n \n\n   \n  Autism prevalence does vary by location, though. It is highest in California, where it is recognized in around 1 in 19 children, and lowest in Texas, where the prevalence ranges from around 1 in 103 to 1 in 51 children. In Arizona, where I live and work, the prevalence is around 1 in 32, which is very close to the CDC’s overall nationwide estimate.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers believe that this wide geographic variability in autism prevalence  reflects complex interactions  between community awareness and acceptance, the availability of clinical and education services in schools and communities that serve people with autism, broader culture acceptance of mental health challenges, and other societal factors.\n \n\n   \n  The number of autism diagnoses also varies by gender. One well-known feature of autism is that it affects boys more often than girls. In the late 1990s and early 2000s,  four boys for every one girl  was diagnosed with autism. This  disparity persisted   for many   years . But now, it seems to be shrinking: In the May 2025 data, the  ratio for boys versus girls is 3.4 to 1 .\n \n\n   \n  This shift reflects the growing understanding  that autism looks different in girls  than in boys, which in turn allows clinicians to accurately identify it in girls in larger numbers.\n \n\n   \n    From recognition to acceptance\n \n\n   \n   Research shows, however , that this increase in autism diagnoses is not something to fear.\n \n\n   \n  While some children diagnosed with autism are  profoundly affected  and require significant support, many others successfully engage in everyday activities like school, sports and work. One 2022 study found that a majority of children reported as having autism by their parents  expect to attend college . This suggests that many people diagnosed with autism feel they are capable of living full and productive lives.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, understanding the patterns of autism prevalence does not explain why it occurs in the first place. Research suggests that  genes are a major cause of autism . But many things have changed over the past several decades since researchers and clinicians began tracking autism occurrence. For example,  the criteria clinicians use to diagnose autism  have changed over time to  become less restrictive .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  Why some autistic people don’t speak \n \n\n   \n  Today, a wider variety of symptoms are included in the diagnostic definition of autism spectrum disorder than when autism was first introduced as a  mental health condition in 1980 .\n \n\n   \n  Another change is that autism is much more widely accepted in society than it was just a decade ago. For example,  autistic characters are often portrayed in media  as protagonists that the audience is cheering for. This growing recognition and acceptance is associated with an  increase in self-diagnosis of autism .\n \n\n   \n    Building richer communities\n \n\n   \n  While autistic people tend to have  some unique challenges , including repetitive behaviors, restricted interests and social communication difficulties, they also have particular strengths, such as  creative, out-of-the-box thinking . For me, this includes seeing connections that others miss.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic people report that their  unique perspective offers specific benefits  in their workplaces and careers. Many go on to  make important contributions  to their communities and to shape society as a whole.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Temple Grandin,  an outspoken author and speaker on autism  and a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, has credited her autism with influencing her research on animal handling and animal behaviors. Comedian Dan Aykroyd, who was  an original cast member and host of “Saturday Night Live” , credits his diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome and fixation on ghosts for  developing the movie “Ghostbusters” .\n \n\n   \n   Read more:  How federal officials talk about health is shifting in ways that make me worried for my autistic child \n \n\n   \n  A more complete picture of autism that includes strengths as well as challenges creates a starting point for building communities that are inclusive and accepting of autistic people. From there, policymakers, employers and others can start to create dynamic and vibrant places where people with autism can successfully live, work and play alongside their nonautistic peers.\n \n\n   \n  And, given that  children with autism will become adults with autism , it allows experts like me to identify needs and design policies that help communities support autistic people at different stages of their life.\n \n\n   \n  For example, the growing number of students with developmental challenges  raises demands on special education services . This means state and local education systems may need to develop and implement specialized training programs for educators to better support autistic students in the classroom.\n \n\n   \n  Autistic children who need accommodations in school may also need support to succeed in adulthood. This can range from having physicians who  gear their clinical practices  to better listen to autistic patients to  work-from-home and other accommodations  that encourage engagement with traditional employment.\n \n\n   \n  Broader frameworks such as laws and policies can also help attune workplaces and other environments to the needs of people with autism. For example,  independent living programs  and programs that  train, hire and retain workers with disabilities  can ensure the economic success of people with autism.\n \n\n   \n  Cities can also become  autism certified , a process that brings together community stakeholders in health care, education, local government, hospitality and leisure to better serve those with autism. This includes training on how to interact with people who have cognitive differences as well as creating sensory-friendly environments. The city that I live in – Mesa, Arizona –  was the first to gain  such certification in 2019, and a  handful of other cities  have followed suit.\n \n\n   \n  As I see it, rather than a cause for fear, the growing recognition of autism is an invitation to build a world where every way of thinking and being has a chance to thrive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:44:00-04:00","title":"Trade deals and $90 billion in tariff revenue: What’s riding on the landmark Supreme Court case kicking off this week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether President Donald Trump had legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a move central to his economic agenda.

\nUpdated: \n        5:44 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In just a few days, the Supreme Court will start hearing arguments in what President Donald Trump is calling “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”\n \n\n   \n  With the bulk of his tariffs — arguably the cornerstone of his entire economic agenda — in jeopardy, he has floated an unprecedented appearance at the nation’s highest court.\n \n\n   \n  The case will consider whether Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs by citing a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n \n\n   \n  Trump used those powers to push import tax rates as high as 50% on key trading partners including India and Brazil and  as high as 145%  on China earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  A ruling against the president does not mean the sudden cancellation of all tariffs in place, but the outcome could radically reshape Trump’s economic strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s riding on the Supreme Court’s decision:\n \n\n   \n    Almost $90 billion in tariff revenue\n \n\n   \n  As of September 23, American businesses have paid nearly $90 billion to cover the IEEPA tariffs being challenged, according to US Customs and Border Patrol data. That’s more than half of the tariff revenue the country collected during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions of dollars they have already paid.\n \n\n   \n  While the case plays out — and it could go on for several months — businesses will need to keep paying IEEPA tariffs, so the sum of potential refunds will keep growing.\n \n\n   \n  However, it would not be an easy or quick process for businesses to get refunds. It’s also unclear if all businesses that have paid these tariffs would qualify for a refund. The justices would likely make such determinations if they ultimately render Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, trade attorneys  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n    Trade agreements\n \n\n   \n  The threat of instantly imposing higher tariffs is a  key tool  Trump has used to pressure countries into entering trade agreements and, in some cases, signing deals with the United States. In exchange, trading partners have committed to increasing purchases of American goods and increasing their investments in American businesses on top of lowering tariffs on American exports.\n \n\n   \n  But all that could be jeopardized if the Supreme Court sides against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The IEEPA tariffs have been the basis for countries to reach agreements with the United States, and it is unknown what happens if the IEEPA tariffs no longer can be imposed,” Dave Townsend, a partner in Dorsey & Whitney’s International Trade Group, said in a note last week.\n \n\n   \n  “Presumably, the Trump Administration will claim that nothing changes, and that the agreements remain valid,” he added. But it could certainly incentivize trading partners to try to go back to the drawing table with Trump, aiming to get better arrangements. It could even empower some countries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs on American exports until their own border taxes are lowered.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for Trump’s tariff agenda\n \n\n   \n  US presidents have always had an  extensive menu  of tariffs to impose. But Trump has mainly used two in his second term: the IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs, which give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs can only be used to target specific industry sectors, and require an investigation by the Commerce Department. Trump has used Section 232 this year to raise border taxes on autos, auto parts, steel, aluminum, copper and furniture, among others. He’s also initiated several ongoing investigations that could result in higher levies on a slew of other goods.\n \n\n   \n  Trump will retain the ability to impose those tariffs as well as several others no matter how the Supreme Court rules. But none of those will allow him to change import duties with the flick of a switch, as he has done with IEEPA.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/americas/mexico-mayor-killed-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:29:00-04:00","title":"Mexico’s Sheinbaum pledges justice after murder of outspoken anti-crime mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged full justice and zero impunity following the murder of Carlos Manzo, the outspoken mayor of Uruapan in Michoacan, who was shot during a Day of the Dead festival despite having federal protection since December 2024.

\n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The houses are worn by weather and time, photographed in isolation like forgotten monuments. They have a haunted feel: Windows are boarded on Victorian-era turrets; paint flakes off the towering composite columns of a once-grand portico; wraparound verandas, perhaps once host to evening nightcaps and slow Sunday mornings, are barren. Walls crumble, roofs collapse, and greenery reclaims them.\n \n\n   \n  For a decade, the New York-based photographer  Bryan Sansivero  has sought out forgotten, dilapidated homes across the United States — each with its own story to tell. Inside deserted clapboard farmsteads, palatial Antebellum-era plantation houses and maximalist Queen Anne-style structures, Sansivero has discovered many residences that were never emptied, offering a portal into another life.\n \n\n   \n  Musty libraries are filled with books, papers and photographs; in one, a nearby coffee mug sits unretrieved. Grand pianos and half-full liquor bottles collect dust, while colorful children’s playrooms scattered with toys are unsettlingly idle. The images come together in his  latest book , “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about capturing these time capsules; these lost places,” he explained in a phone call. “I like the mystery of not knowing what you’re going to find.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero has documented abandoned spaces since he was a film studies major in college, starting out with the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, a disused psychiatric hospital in Long Island that served as the setting for his documentary thesis.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, he found himself drawn to private residences — millions of which are abandoned across the country — especially as urban exploration, or “urbex,” became a highly monetized form of social media content that has become what he likens to a competitive sport. Abandoned hospitals, churches and schools are easy to find; houses, on the other hand, have a sense of discovery.\n \n\n   \n  “If you go viral, you can get two million likes and hundreds of thousands of followers, and people are trying to chase that,” he said, saying it becomes about “the most views, the biggest and the best and all of that.”   Instead, Sansivero has reacted in opposition, opting for the slow and deliberate methodology of medium-format film — though he does still post his images to more than  100,000 followers on Instagram . “For me, I’ve just been going backwards. I want to shoot more film. I want to shoot less digital, with an emphasis on using older, unique equipment.”\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean the homes Sansivero finds have been untouched since they were inhabited. Many have been destroyed or vandalized, perhaps by squatters, teenagers or the urbex set. Occasionally, he’s gotten a tip on a house only to find it filled by other photographers and content creators racing to be there first.\n \n\n   \n  But often, he finds houses by chance, or with help from Google Earth, taking weeklong trips to the South or Midwest to areas impacted by the loss of industry or other economic or environmental pressures.\n \n\n   \n  His treks come with risks — he’s inhaled mold (and now carries masks), his leg has gone through a decaying floor, and he’s felt the uneasy sway of a home seemingly near collapse. Yet he’s been undeterred, drawn to dramatic architecture and eccentric or historical collections, such as a room stacked high with vintage dollhouses, mannequins populating a house like ghosts, or interiors still decorated for a Christmas of the distant past.\n \n\n   \n  “I can find a dozen or more houses exploring in a day and not want to photograph anything, because it’s an empty shell or it’s been trashed — it’s not telling a story about the previous owner,” he said. “I’m interested in what happened, why it was left like this.”\n \n\n   \n  Sansivero researches the houses he photographs to whatever extent he can, but in “America the Abandoned,” he shares limited details, giving a sense of who lived there but anonymizing them, avoiding social media’s instinct to exploit or exhaust a tragic story. Among the homes he has discovered are former respective residences of a local politician, an important fashion and textile designer, and a Pulitzer-Prize winning author. In one house, filled with life-sized mannequin mermaids, he found a disturbing published account that told the tale of a serial killer with victims in the basement, he recounted. The mermaids’ origins remain unknown.\n \n\n   \n  The photographer found that former residence by chance when he was with a friend on the road; the boarded-up brick property by the highway was unmissable. “We were just driving down the highway, and I was like, ‘Oh, look at that house.’”\n \n\n   \n  Lately, Sansivero has set his sights overseas, exploring chateaus and castles in Europe whose histories can stretch back much further in time. “America the Abandoned” may be a cap on a decade-long exploration of US homes, but it’s likely more a pause than an end to the work. After all, as Sansivero noted, with time, there will always be more to discover.\n \n\n   \n   Images: Excerpted from “America the Abandoned: Captivating Portraits of Deserted Homes” © 2025 Bryan Sansivero.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Brian O’Hara took over the Minneapolis Police Department in 2022, he saw a department in free fall.\n \n\n   \n  The  murder of George Floyd  and the ensuing riots in 2020 had fractured the public’s trust in law enforcement. Crime and shootings were rising at startling levels. The police force was demoralized and dropped from over 900 sworn officers to a low of 550 last year, stretched dangerously thin in a city of over 400,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  “It was, essentially, kind of a hopeless situation,” O’Hara told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got here, the Minneapolis Police Department was functioning more like a Fire Department,” he said. “The officers were traumatized. They were sitting in the station, only going out on calls. There wasn’t that much proactive activity happening.”\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, staffing has begun to recover. Using an aggressive recruitment strategy, the police department surpassed 600 sworn personnel in June – a  milestone Mayor Jacob Frey praised in a city news release .\n \n\n   \n  But challenges and criticisms remain, including a recent mass shooting at a homeless encampment, state and federal consent decrees and questions about police’s interaction with federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Minneapolis voters will have their say.\n \n\n   \n  A mayoral election on Tuesday pits Frey, the two-term incumbent, against over a dozen challengers, led by three progressive rivals: State Sen. and Democratic Socialist Omar Fateh, attorney and businessman Jazz Hampton and minister DeWayne Davis. That trio has criticized the city’s public safety efforts and joined forces for a “ slate for change ” in an election that uses  ranked choice voting .\n \n\n   \n  Early polling shows Frey as the favorite, with Fateh his closest competitor.\n \n\n   \n  The election bears some similarities to New York City’s, with both Fateh and Zohran Mamdani as 30-something, Muslim, Democratic Socialists who have proposed rent stabilization policies.\n \n\n   \n  In Minneapolis, police staffing and public safety have been key concerns among voters – for example, they were the first two questions in a mayoral debate hosted by  MPR News/Star Tribune  last week.\n \n\n   \n  The terms of the debate have generally pitted Frey, who has criticized calls to “defund the police,” against a left-wing critic in Fateh, who  has said  Frey “failed to implement meaningful reforms to police” and has pushed to shift some responsibilities from police to other departments.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever wins the race will have the power to set the city’s police culture, said Michelle Gross, the president of the activist group  Communities United Against Police Brutality . Yet no matter who is in charge, she said, the future success of the police will come from building trust with the community.\n \n\n   \n  “Things are different now, but they’re not all the way different, but we’re getting there,” she told CNN. “And the bottom line is to keep people at the table so we do get there.”\n \n\n   \n    The battle to regain public trust\n \n\n   \n  Jason Fletcher, the founder of Fletcher’s Ice Cream & Cafe, got an up-close view of the Minneapolis police when his shop was targeted by a  Molotov cocktail  twice within a 24-hour period last week.\n \n\n   \n  The explosive attacks caused damage to his shop, though no one was injured. He said he believes the LGBTQ Pride flag outside his business may be the reason it was targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Fletcher said he didn’t have the “highest expectations” for police, noting its well-known staff shortages and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I definitely have seen a lot of the officers that are here, they’re discouraged,” he told CNN. “I feel like they’ve lost the passion for their job, a lot of them, and a lot of them are scared.”\n \n\n   \n  But the job they did investigating the attacks was “really amazing,” he said. Police responded to the scene before he did both times and worked quickly and efficiently to arrest a suspect.\n \n\n   \n  “They were reassuring. Minneapolis arson – the officer, he looked me in the face and said, ‘I’m not gonna go home until this man is behind bars.’ And he didn’t lie,” Fletcher said. “In less than four hours, they apprehended him and made sure they got him off the street.\n \n\n   \n  “In my opinion, Minneapolis police and ATF, they killed it. They did a great job.”\n \n\n   \n  As police chief, O’Hara said his primary goal has been to push a sense of urgency and pride in the department, while still acknowledging its unique challenges.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re the most scrutinized police department on earth. It’s a tough job,” he said. “But if you do come on this job, and you’re coming on for the right reasons, you have an opportunity, once your career is over, to look back on what you’ve done and realize every day of your life you have an opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives.\n \n\n   \n  “There are people in this community who have real needs, who desperately need the police and they need good police,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  That pitch has helped the department start to rebuild its staff, now up to 620 sworn members and looking to continue growing into next year, O’Hara said. Still, the department relies on an “exorbitant” amount of overtime just to do basic police work and cover all its shifts.\n \n\n   \n  “The amount of overtime that we depend on for those things is not sustainable,” he said. “But the good news for our officers that are here is those numbers are rising, but it is a gradual process. It’s going to take time.”\n \n\n   \n    The politics of public safety\n \n\n   \n  No matter who wins the mayoral election, Minneapolis is still legally required to enact police reforms.\n \n\n   \n  After a jury convicted former police officer  Derek Chauvin  of the murder of George Floyd in 2021, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. The  DOJ issued a report  in 2023 finding the city and police engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives people of their rights. This January, the city and DOJ agreed to a  federal consent decree  that requires police reforms and court supervision.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights  reached a court-enforceable agreement  with Minneapolis requiring changes to address race-based policing.\n \n\n   \n  In May, the DOJ under President Donald Trump  moved to end  the federal consent decree. However, Frey signed an  executive order  confirming the city’s commitment to implementing the reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Gross, the community activist, said her group has been working with police on its reforms.\n \n\n   \n  “The Minneapolis Police are rewriting their policies, and as part of the condition of doing that work, they actually have to take input from the community, and we have been working very hard to give them very robust input,” she said. “It’s not word-smithing, it’s looking at best practices and looking at what has worked in other departments.”\n \n\n   \n  The hope is these consent decrees and agreements provide a path forward for the city and police.\n \n\n   \n  “These are good things,” she said. “It gives us a framework to make the kinds of improvements we need to make. Unfortunately, we’re still a long way from getting there, but we’ve got a way to get there.”\n \n\n   \n    What the candidates have said about policing\n \n\n   \n  The mayoral candidates have taken different approaches to the politics of policing in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Minneapolis residents  rejected a ballot measure  that would have overhauled the city’s police structure, replacing the police department with a Department of Public Safety. The measure, wrapped up in “ defund the police ” debates, had been drafted amid the national fury over Floyd’s murder but was put to voters as concerns about rising crime drained energy from the protest movement.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh supported the ballot measure. Frey did not.\n \n\n   \n  That contrast has been on display this mayoral election, as Frey has accused Fateh of supporting defund the police measures.\n \n\n   \n  “Here’s the truth: We also need more police officers to be able to handle these situations. When you have less officers per capita than virtually any city in the country, you need to do the necessary work to increase that,” Frey said.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh has countered that he is merely proposing moving some responsibilities from the police to other departments. He has repeatedly cited a study from  NYU Law’s Policing Project  that found 47% of police calls are “potential” candidates for an alternate response.\n \n\n   \n  “If we’re able to take away nearly half of their caseload, then we can have law enforcement focus on violent crime, on drug trafficking, on human trafficking, clearly the case backlog, not taking away investigators from the caseload or their investigatory work,” Fateh said.\n \n\n   \n  For O’Hara, a transplant from Newark, New Jersey, his first mayoral election in Minneapolis has been a lot to take in.\n \n\n   \n  “I have been surprised by how overly politicized policing is here,” he said. “I’m just not used to it. I’m used to more people being able to agree we need police and we need good police, and we need to address this stuff urgently. Some of it is a little foreign to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-trump-midterms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are More Enthusiastic About Midterms as Trump’s Approval Hits a Second-Term Low, CNN Poll Finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2026 midterm elections approach, a CNN poll by SSRS reveals that Democrats are gaining early enthusiasm among voters, with 47% indicating they would vote for a Democrat if the election were held today.

a second-term low, CNN poll finds \n       \n  By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year out from the midterm elections, the Democratic Party holds a sizable enthusiasm advantage as views of President Donald Trump dip further into negative territory, according to a new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS .\n \n\n   \n  The fall of 2025 is not a replay of 2017, the year before the Democrats captured control of the US House in Trump’s first term. The Democrats’ 5-point advantage among registered voters in the generic congressional ballot falls short of  the 11-point edge they held in CNN polling  a year before the 2018 midterms. And favorable views of the party still stand  near all-time lows  as they have throughout this year, 8 points below where they were in the fall of Trump’s first year in office.\n \n\n   \n  In a midterm election year, though, views of the president can outweigh perceptions of the opposition party. Trump’s approval rating in the poll stands at 37%, the worst of his second term in CNN polling and roughly equivalent to his 36% approval rating at this point in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  And his disapproval rating, at 63%, is numerically the highest of either term, one point above the previous high of 62% as he was leaving office in January 2021.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, which puts Trump’s approval rating a few points higher at 41% as of Sunday, charts a similar trend since January. Approval of the president has dipped across partisan and demographic lines since the summer in CNN’s polling.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats have a very early advantage\n \n\n   \n  Looking ahead  to next year’s midterms, Democrats appear to have a very early advantage: 47% of registered voters say they’d vote for the Democrat in their district if the election were held today, while 42% prefer the Republican. More say they’ve ruled out supporting a Republican (42%) than say the same about a Democrat (35%). And 41% say they would be sending a message that they oppose Trump with their vote, nearly double the 21% who say their vote would be a message of support for the president. Independents break in Democrats’ favor on the generic ballot (44% to 31% for Republicans, with 19% saying they wouldn’t pick either right now).\n \n\n   \n  Registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republican-aligned voters to say they are extremely motivated to vote next year (67% compared with 46%). Those Democratic-aligned voters who consider the state of democracy to be a top concern are perhaps the most fired up within the party: 82% in that group say they are deeply motivated to vote, compared with 57 % among Democratic-aligned voters who call the economy their top concern.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s poll results suggest that the Democratic Party’s ongoing internal image troubles may not necessarily translate into defections at the ballot box. Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP), but even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated).\n \n\n   \n  All told, Democrats hold a 12-point advantage among those voters who say they are extremely or very motivated to turn out next year.\n \n\n   \n    Broad dissatisfaction with Trump and the country\n \n\n   \n  Americans are broadly dissatisfied with the state of the country (68% say things are going badly) and the economy (72% say it’s in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the US). About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 8 in 10 consider the federal government shutdown a crisis (31%) or a major problem (50%), and 61% disapprove of Trump’s handling of it. Nearly as many disapprove of the way each party’s congressional leadership is handling it (58% disapprove of each). Taken all together, about 9 in 10 American disapprove of at least one of those three players on the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A majority hold negative views of Trump’s performance on several other key issues: most (56%) feel that his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world and 57% say he’s gone too far deporting immigrants living in the US illegally.\n \n\n   \n  About a quarter of Americans (26%) say the state of US democracy is the top issue facing the nation, and it is the top issue among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (45% say it’s the most important issue, with the economy and cost of living at 38%).\n \n\n   \n  Americans are increasingly likely to say Trump has gone too far in using the power of the presidency – 61% say so, up 9 points since February. On his teardown of the East Wing of the White House, 54% of the public is dissatisfied or angry, with just 10% saying they’re satisfied with or happy about that decision. Another 36% (including nearly half of Republicans) say it doesn’t matter much to them.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans also see the Republicans who control Congress as doing too much to support Trump (55%, up from 48% who felt that way in February). But the GOP base is pleased: Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are largely satisfied with the level of support the GOP in Congress provides to Trump (63% say it’s the right amount, about the same as in February).\n \n\n   \n  On the Democratic side, though, views are more divided and party support less clear. Four in 10 say the Democrats in Congress aren’t doing enough to oppose Trump, and among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 69% feel that way.\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from October 27 to 30 among a random national sample of 1,245 adults, including 954 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is plus or minus 3.6 points for results among registered voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/worst-weekend-air-traffic-control-staff-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"04:48:00+00:00","title":"Worst Weekend for Air Traffic Controller Staffing Since Start of Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the ongoing federal government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025, air traffic control staffing shortages reached their worst levels, with 98 staffing trigger reports recorded between Friday and Sunday.

to the  ongoing federal government shutdown  continue, with this past weekend marking the worst for air traffic control staffing shortages since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans.\n \n\n   \n  Between Friday morning and Sunday night, there were 98 “staffing trigger” reports at FAA facilities, meaning air traffic controllers had to alter operations to keep the airspace safe with fewer people working.\n \n\n   \n  The alterations can include rerouting planes or delaying flights when there are not enough controllers to handle the normal workload.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers are considered  essential staff  and must work during the government shutdown, despite not getting paid. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said some controllers have called in sick in protest while others are taking time off to work other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Not every staffing shortage results in a delay, as controllers can reroute flights, but sometimes there is no choice but to slow planes down to maintain safety.\n \n\n   \n  Friday, which was Halloween, saw 46 facilities impacted by staffing shortages. On Saturday, 34 facilities were short staffed and on Sunday, the number was 18.\n \n\n   \n  Control towers in Austin, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Boston, Dallas, Denver, Nashville and Phoenix were all short staffed at some point over the weekend. Shifts of controllers who deal with flights enroute at high altitude, and other controllers who handle approaching and departing airports were also short staffed.\n \n\n   \n  The team that manages flights headed to Newark Liberty International Airport reported more staffing triggers than any other single operation.\n \n\n   \n  A “surge” in controllers calling out on Halloween “strained” staffing at half of the  30 largest airports  in the country,  according to the FAA .

No, we will stop traffic. So, we’re not going to let that happen. I think the real consequence is, what kind of rolling delays do you have throughout the system.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of the shutdown, 393 facilities have reported a staffing trigger – roughly four times as many as were reported on the same dates last year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/sport/nascar-cup-series-championship-larson-hamlin","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00-05:00","title":"Kyle Larson outlasts Denny Hamlin to win second career NASCAR Cup Series championship","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kyle Larson won his second NASCAR Cup Series championship in 2025, edging out Denny Hamlin in a dramatic final race at Phoenix Raceway in Avondale, Arizona.

achieve glory after making his NASCAR debut in 2004, found himself three laps away from the win when Byron got a flat tire and hit the wall alongside the track to bring out the caution.\n \n\n   \n  The Joe Gibbs Racing driver, Hamlin, then went to pit for four new tires while Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson only got two which placed him in fifth position ahead of Hamlin, who was in 10th.\n \n\n   \n  With not enough time in the race, Hamlin finished in sixth as Ryan Blaney, who was eliminated from title contention last week, took the checkered flag.\n \n\n   \n  It is the second championship for the 33-year-old in 11 seasons. Larson won his  first title in 2021  when he joined Hendrick Motorsports.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I can’t believe it. We didn’t lead a lap today and somehow won the championship,” Larson told the NBC broadcast after the race. “Really, I’m just speechless. I can’t believe it. We had an average car at best.”\n \n\n   \n  An emotionless Hamlin sat in his car, wiping his face with a towel as Larson celebrated with his team. After some time, Hamlin emerged from his car and was greeted by his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates, relishing the fact his sixth attempt at a title wasted away despite leading 208 of the 319 laps after starting on the pole.\n \n\n   \n  “Nothing I could do different. I mean, prepared as good as I could coming into the weekend and my team gave me a fantastic car,” Hamlin said. “Just didn’t work out. I was just praying ‘no caution’ and we had one there. What can you do? It’s just not meant to be.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamlin said his crew chief made the right call with the tires and reiterated that the team did a “fantastic job” while sounding defeated on his future chances.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll try. I got a couple more shots at it but man, if you can’t win that one, I don’t know which one you can win,” Hamlin added.\n \n\n   \n  Larson, the only Asian American to race full-time in NASCAR, has not won a race since May, totaling 24 consecutive races but thanked his crew chief Cliff Daniels for keeping the team together.\n \n\n   \n  “Unbelievable! What a year by Hendrick Motorsports team. Cliff Daniels, everybody,” Larson said. “His leadership – his complete leadership just showed that whole race. Keep us all motivated. Always having a plan and all that. So, thats the story of our season.”\n \n\n   \n  Briscoe finished in 18th with Byron coming in 33rd after the late issue.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/automakers-outlook-tariff-regulation-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Carmakers worried Trump’s tariffs would shred their bottom lines.

Here’s how they avoided the worst of it \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump introduced his tariff policy   earlier this year, it looked like a disaster for automakers. But even with US tariffs on imported cars and parts, it has shaped up to be a pretty good time for car companies.\n \n\n   \n  Most automakers, even US-based ones, import some cars and most parts. But car companies’ dire cost estimates have decreased as tariffs keep getting rolled back, bit by bit.\n \n\n   \n  More   importantly for automakers’ bottom lines, the financial penalties for not meeting fuel efficiency rules have all but vanished. Those regulatory savings could eventually offset the cost of tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  All in all, one could argue that auto industry profits could end up better off than they were before Trump took office in January, a surprising outcome as automakers’ huge investments in electric vehicles in recent years were also being undercut by Trump pulling the plug on the federal support of electric vehicles they had counted on when making that massive bet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely favorable,” said Jeff Schuster, an independent auto analyst about the changes since auto tariffs were first announced in March. “There are so many moving pieces, it’s hard to isolate. But things are definitely better off than anyone expected.”\n \n\n   \n    Tariff costs not as bad as feared\n \n\n   \n  Automakers were close to panic when Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, including those from Mexico and Canada, since all companies depend on imported parts to build at US assembly plants and almost all import from those neighboring countries. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tariffs “would blow a hole in the US industry that we’ve never seen.”\n \n\n   \n  But it turned out it wasn’t as bad as they feared, as Trump continued to reduce the worst of the duties’ impact almost immediately. General Motors and Ford, which had forecast billions in annual costs, have each reduced those assessments. GM trimmed its $5 billion estimate by $500 million last month. Ford cut its estimated tariff cost for 2025 in half, from $2 billion to $1 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Volkswagen reported a 1 billion euro loss ($1.3 billion) in the third quarter and said that the tariffs would cost it up to $5.8 billion this year. But some of the loss was due to other problems with its European EVs and a reorganization at Porsche.\n \n\n   \n  While tariff costs have also trimmed automakers’ profits, companies managed to beat expectations. For example, GM’s adjusted earnings per share had been forecast to fall 23% in the third quarter. Instead, it fell just 5%. Even the Volkswagen loss was less than a quarter of forecasts.\n \n\n   \n  Even automakers from Asia and Europe have been able to weather the storm, since they build a significant share of their US-sold vehicles in America.   \n \n\n   \n  Hyundai CEO José Muñoz told reporters in New York in September that even with the US tariffs, the United States, not South Korea, is Hyundai’s most profitable market. He expects that to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Tariffs are still a headwind,” said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities. “But so far they’ve been digested well.”\n \n\n   \n  And further tariff reductions are likely if the administration reaches a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico —   two of the largest sources of imported cars and auto parts.\n \n\n   \n  Trump recently halted Canadian trade negotiations after an ad funded by the province of Ontario featured a 1987 anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan. But experts think there will be some kind of trade deal in the future.\n \n\n   \n  A free trade deal with South Korea, another source of imported vehicles, would also help reduce tariff costs for not just Hyundai and Kia but also General Motors, which builds some of the cheaper cars at its US dealerships in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  The blunted tariff impact has also benefitted car buyers.\n \n\n   \n  Companies have not passed on the increased tariff costs to consumers, at least not directly. However, there have been some quiet moves by automakers to recoup some of the costs of the duties, such as charging for equipment that had once been included in the price, or ending production on less profitable models.\n \n\n   \n  As a results, the average price of a new car purchase stands at just around $50,000, according to estimates from Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book, up about 4% from a year ago.\n \n\n   \n    Big savings from regulatory changes\n \n\n   \n  While tariffs capture most of the headlines about government action, there’s been a less publicized windfall for automakers: the end of financial penalties for violating emissions standards.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, automakers avoided fines for selling too many gasoline vehicles by purchasing so-called regulatory credits from companies that fell below emission standards, like electric vehicle maker Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  But those penalties were eliminated in July’s tax and spending bill, saving the automakers billions. Ford CFO Sherry House told reporters last month it will no longer purchase the $2.5 billion worth of regulatory credits it had planned to buy in the future.\n \n\n   \n  Ives said that no longer having to buy credits should reduce the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%. Automakers can also ramp up sales of the more profitable large trucks and SUVs that were previously capped by emissions levels.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Ford announced it was increasing production of its F-150 and F-Series Super Duty in 2026 by more than 50,000 trucks to meet demand.   GM also revealed plans to shift production of one of its Michigan plants from EVs, which have been losing money, to profitable gasoline powered vehicles.\n \n\n   \n  “As the regulatory costs go away, that does paint a much better picture for the health of the industry than anyone thought would be passed,” said Schuster. “The near-term outlook is much more favorable than in April.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/federal-workers-shutdown-furloughed-job-fairs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Job fairs, hobbies and community conversations: How federal workers are coping with shutdown angst","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown persists past a month, over a million federal workers, including Angela O’Neal of Prince George’s County, Maryland, are furloughed and without pay.

fairs, hobbies and community conversations: How federal workers are coping with shutdown angst \n       \n  By Linda Gaudino, Brian Todd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Almost every day, Angela O’Neal sits down in her at-home creator’s studio, either painting, sketching or contemplating her next original piece to add to an abundant collection.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, her daily ritual has taken on a new meaning as she faces the same challenges as many furloughed federal employees — struggling to pay mounting health care bills, a mortgage and the costs of living without a steady paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown persists past a month, over a million furloughed federal workers will continue to go without pay, including this Prince George’s County, Maryland, resident.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been somewhat devastating for a lot of us,” O’Neal told CNN during an interview in her home. “I don’t think I realized the extent of it until after I saw that I’m not able to go to (physical therapy) appointments because of that… and so it’s been tremendously stressful for a lot of us, and in particular for caregivers and people with chronic health conditions.”\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal works for the US Navy as a program manager and is celebrating 40 years of government employment. She received a letter from her employer stating she had been furloughed on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  She has diabetic neuropathy, which affects mobility and causes numbness, tingling and burning sensations in her feet. One of her main concerns is not being able to afford her medical appointments, some of which she already canceled due to copay costs up to $90. “If I don’t have income, then I can’t make those appointments,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  During these uncertain times, O’Neal leans on her artistic hobby — not only as a coping mechanism, but also as a second form of income. She sells her paintings, prints and posters on her personal website, at rotating exhibits and even at a local cafe.\n \n\n   \n  “Reality changes when there is a picture of it,” O’Neal said. “As a contemporary artist, I am fascinated by how art can alter the way we see and feel. … So, during this government shutdown and furloughing, I find great solace in painting.”\n \n\n   \n    Hedging their bets: Furloughed workers head to job fairs\n \n\n   \n  O’Neal manages the unpredictability through artistry, but others may take a more direct, career-driven approach by canvassing job fairs — some out of precaution, others near desperation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN attended two job fairs in the Washington, DC, area recently. Many furloughed government employees at these events did not want to give their names or speak on camera for fear of losing their jobs. But they gave sobering accounts of the hardships they’re facing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m supporting my kids. I have to tell them we have to budget,” one employee, who was furloughed from the Internal Revenue Service, said at a fair in McLean, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Another employee who didn’t want to name his agency said he’s supporting a young family. “I came all the way from Maryland … an hour-and-a-half, looking for a job,” he said. After struggling to describe the hardship of going weeks without getting paid, he finally told CNN, “I don’t know how much I have left in the tank right now, just to talk to you.”\n \n\n   \n  But a furloughed employee at a job fair in Maryland spoke openly about her struggles to cope with the shutdown.   \n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Baker of Montgomery County received a stop-work order from her employer at the start of the shutdown. She is a policy analyst contracted to the National Institutes of Health through her employer.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t be here at a job fair if I weren’t trying to hedge my bets, as much as my employer has been very good to me,” Baker told CNN, adding that “we’re down to survival.”\n \n\n   \n  Baker told CNN that to financially cope with the shutdown, she is cashing in her holiday pay, using unemployment insurance and consulting on what to do if she can’t pay her rent.\n \n\n   \n  The event hosted by the workforce development group WorkSource Montgomery served federal workers and contractors throughout the area at a time federal workers are particularly in need of support, said the group’s executive director, Anthony Featherstone.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s tough being out of work as a federal worker. You’ve gone to school. You have lots of education and experience and are highly compensated, and now you’re in limbo,” Featherstone said.\n \n\n   \n    A focus on mental health\n \n\n   \n  K Scarry, the owner of the Kbird bar in northwest DC and a former minister, has hosted weekly “opt-in community conversations” for furloughed workers, offering them a chance to share their hardships and to network for other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Scarry set up an additional session last week, inviting CNN along with furloughed workers. But no workers showed. Scarry said she received texts from some of them saying they didn’t want to speak to the media out of fear of retaliation. She told CNN what the conversations have been like in those weekly sessions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s questions about, you know, ‘How do we talk to our kids? Our kids know the government is shut down. They know we work for the government. How do we have that conversation with our kids without overpromising, but also making sure they feel steady?’” she said. Scarry is offering free meals to any furloughed worker who comes to her bar.\n \n\n   \n  Baker stressed the importance of furloughed workers maintaining their mental health during this period of uncertainty. Her advice to others in her same predicament: “Look, the situation is real. It’s rough. Adapt how you can. … Keep the hope. Keep striving. You’re smart. You’ll get through this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/japan-takaichi-north-korea-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"03:08:00-05:00","title":"Japan’s New Prime Minister Takaichi Wants Summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced her intention to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking the first such initiative by a Japanese leader in over 20 years. This comes amid ongoing unresolved tensions stemming from the abduction of at least 17 Japanese citizens by North Korea in the late 1970s and 1980s, a claim supported by a 2014 UN report.

Five citizens were returned in 2002. The abductions appear to have been part of North Korea’s espionage program, according to a  2014 UN report. \n \n\n   \n  Pyongyang disputes the total number taken and says some died in traffic and drowning accidents, as well as suicide, and it considers the matter over.\n \n\n   \n  But for the families of Japanese abductees who remain missing, some of whom were just teenagers when they were taken, there has been no closure or relief. They, along with Japan’s revolving door of leaders over the years, have continued pressing the issue with little success.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has met with the abductees’ families twice since taking office, including once with US President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan. She has previously said she’s committed to completing the mission of her mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who introduced the abductees’ families to Trump during the US president’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The two countries held an unprecedented summit in 2002, with Japan’s then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il – the father of now-leader Kim Jong Un.\n \n\n   \n  That visit was  the first time  a Japanese prime minister visited North Korea since the end of WWII.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the first time North Korea acknowledged its role in the abductions, after many years of denial. Kim Jong Il offered an apology at the time, saying the agents responsible had been punished, and promised to prevent it happening again, according to Japanese  government statements  at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The five detainees were returned to Japan the following month and reunited with their families – 20 to 30 years after their abduction.\n \n\n   \n  Koizumi returned to North Korea to meet Kim Jong Il a second time in 2004, during which the family members of several abductees were also allowed to return to Japan.\n \n\n   \n  No further repatriations have happened since then – and no progress has been made in talks between the two countries, despite repeated efforts by successive governments.\n \n\n   \n  Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had  signaled a willingness  to meet Kim Jong Un without conditions to improve ties between their countries; several years later, then-leader Fumio Kishida also  conveyed his intention  to meet the North Korean leader.\n \n\n   \n  Each time, a meeting failed to materialize. Now Takaichi, who took office after winning an election in October, is inheriting a decades-old problem that stumped her predecessors – and hoping to be the one to solve it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/big-business-supreme-court-trump-tariffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Big business sits out the Supreme Court fight over Donald Trump’s tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs, implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), are legally valid.

They have advanced the case to the nation’s highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent.\n \n\n   \n  The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line and   the economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court hears   arguments Wednesday in the case, which will determine the fate of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as well as duties he has unilaterally imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made the tariffs, a response to trade imbalances and fentanyl trafficking, the centerpiece of his economic agenda.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” said  Victor Owen Schwartz , the founder of V.O.S. Selections, the wine and spirits company that is one of the lead plaintiffs in the litigation. “So when I was afforded the opportunity to speak for small American business, I took it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law to reshape global trade and   alliances with allies and adversaries. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses suing the administration say the moves are driving costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.\n \n\n   \n  While the president has described the case as an existential one for the country, he has avoided criticizing the companies involved in the litigation directly. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage.\n \n\n   \n  Several plaintiffs interviewed by CNN were careful to frame the case as far away from national politics as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not targeting Mr. Trump because I’m not a politician,” he said. “I’m a taxpayer who’s been hit with an unlawful tax.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has argued the law’s words clearly encompass tariffs, even if the word “tariff” is not explicitly included. And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “Plaintiffs would unwind trade arrangements worth trillions of dollars, as President Trump has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into negotiated framework deals with major trading partners – including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and now China – that address underlying causes of the declared emergencies,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in written arguments last week.\n \n\n   \n    Taking a side\n \n\n   \n  Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices.\n \n\n   \n  Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel –  signed a brief urging the justices  not to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance.\n \n\n   \n  Months later, the court  ignored their advice . Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facing  criticism in the second Trump administration  for efforts to expand diversity within their workforces.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook  personally signed an amicus brief  at the high court supporting the continuation of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , program created during the Obama administration for Dreamers. Home Depot  signed a brief in 2021  in a case on damages suits. Walmart  jumped into an appeal  in 2017 dealing with the credit card industry.\n \n\n   \n  But the big difference today is the administration’s willingness to  pursue retribution  against critics. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  “The federal government has immense leverage and immense power and can upend your business with a tweet or a tax investigation,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “I think there’s a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court to  pause a case involving Trump’s use of the National Guard  in Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials.\n \n\n   \n    Fearing the ‘pain cave’\n \n\n   \n  Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women’s outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven’t engaged in the tariffs appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailers  endured public blowback from Trump  this year when they threatened tariff-related price increases.\n \n\n   \n  “That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  But larger companies, Abel said, also may not be as immediately affected by tariffs as small ones. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don’t involve taking a public position in a high-profile case.\n \n\n   \n  Some, meanwhile, have  managed to secure exemptions  to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The briefs that have made their way to the Supreme Court overwhelmingly oppose Trump’s emergency tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they’re opposed to the import taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in favor of unwinding Trump’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn’t disclose its donors without their permission.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that’s not already before the court.”\n \n\n   \n  Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/mississippi-woman-kills-escaped-monkey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00-05:00","title":"Mississippi woman kills escaped research monkey fearing for her children’s safety","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Mississippi woman, Jessica Bond Ferguson, shot and killed an escaped rhesus monkey near Heidelberg, fearing for her children’s safety.

Mississippi (AP) —  One of the monkeys that  escaped last week  after a truck overturned on a Mississippi roadway was shot and killed early Sunday by a homeowner who says she feared for the safety of her children.\n \n\n   \n  Jessica Bond Ferguson said she was alerted early Sunday by her 16-year-old son, who said he thought he had seen a monkey running in the yard outside their home near Heidelberg, Mississippi. She got out bed, grabbed her firearm and her cellphone and stepped outside where she saw the monkey about 60 feet away.\n \n\n   \n  Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases so she fired her gun.\n \n\n   \n  “I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that’s when he fell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn’t have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Before Bond Ferguson had gone out the door, she had called the police and was told to keep an eye on the monkey. But she said worried that if the monkey got away it would threaten children at another house.\n \n\n   \n  “If it attacked somebody’s kid, and I could have stopped it, that would be a lot on me,” said Bond Ferguson, a 35-year-old professional chef. “It’s kind of scary and dangerous that they are running around, and people have kids playing in their yards.”\n \n\n   \n  The Rhesus monkeys had been housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university. In a statement last week, Tulane said the monkeys do not belong to the university, and they were not being transported by the university.\n \n\n   \n  A truck carrying the monkeys overturned Tuesday on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg. Of 21 the monkeys in the truck, 13 were found at the scene of the accident and arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane. Another five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles from the state capital, Jackson.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. Video recorded after the crash showed monkeys crawling through tall grass beside the interstate, where wooden crates labeled “live animals” were crumpled and strewn about.\n \n\n   \n  Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson had said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports by the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. Nonetheless, Johnson said the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature.\n \n\n   \n  The monkeys had recently received checkups confirming they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Rhesus macaques “are known to be aggressive,” according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. It said the agency’s conservation workers were working with sheriff’s officials in the search for the animals.\n \n\n   \n  The search comes about one year after  43 Rhesus macaques escaped  from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research because an employee didn’t fully lock an enclosure. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, had set up traps to capture them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/trump-dilbert-scott-adams-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:48:00-05:00","title":"Trump says he is ‘on it’ after ‘Dilbert’ creator Scott Adams pleads for lifesaving help","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scott Adams, the creator of the 'Dilbert' comic strip, has metastasized prostate cancer and is seeking access to the FDA-approved drug Pluvicto to improve his chances of survival.

In a court filing, officials said depleting that fund means \"no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\" Starting Nov. 1, SNAP benefits did not hit accounts as expected after the USDA, which administers SNAP, froze funding, citing the federal government shutdown. The shutdown is now in its 35th day. It is unclear when low-income families who depend on SNAP will receive these partial funds. The Trump administration said it anticipates long delays — \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" — before benefits arrive in the hands of registered SNAP recipients. Last week,  two federal judges  ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits but did not issue a temporary restraining order. In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order and said the Trump administration must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday,  Ocean State Media reported.  Both judges were appointed by former President Barack Obama. Are you worried about your SNAP benefits?   NPR wants to hear your story SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities. Food banks are stretched thin In the few days since SNAP funding elapsed,  food banks  across the country have experienced  a surge of people in need  of their services, leading to  long lines  and widespread worries about  how they will meet  the escalating demand in the coming weeks. Some food bank administrators warn that it may soon amount to a  public health crisis . Small grocery stores ,  local farmers , and other retailers  authorized to accept SNAP benefits  are also bracing for changes as many of their usual customers are without the means to pay for food this month. Some local communities have set up informal systems to  support their neighbors  in need of food assistance. In several cities, food banks  have collaborated with government officials  to connect residents with food resources. Others  put out calls for volunteers  to support their work. While many food banks have previously dealt with difficult situations like natural disasters that strained their operations, the scale of this nationwide shutdown  represents an unprecedented national food crisis .

Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the uncertainty and lapse in benefits in states across the country. Here's what we know so far. State-specific impacts: Alabama Roughly  749,000 people  are enrolled in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA.  In 2024, SNAP assistance reached  15% of the state population  (1 in 7 people).  Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state,  says on its website that  individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted. Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores.

Michelle DeWitt, executive director of Bethel Community Services Foundation, said the state's formal food security safety nets are already stretched thin in the wake of the early October storm. [ Alaska Public Media ] Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NPR's Scott Detrow  that she hopes that contingency funding can be used to help pay out SNAP benefits, particularly for those impacted by Typhoon Halong. \"I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters,\" she said on Friday. \"For those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.\" Arizona More than  887,000 people  are enrolled in SNAP in Arizona, according to the USDA.  Indigenous communities, including the Navajo and Cherokee Nations have been hit particularly hard. A third of Navajo households depend on SNAP. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. declared a state of emergency \"due to this federally imposed food crisis.\" [ KJZZ ] The Arizona Department of Economic Security, which administers SNAP in the state, is directing Arizona SNAP recipients to local food banks if they need immediate food assistance. Food banks in Arizona can be found through the  Arizona Food Bank Network .

The agency is awaiting further guidance from USDA. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders  directed $500,000 to six food bank networks across Arkansas , blaming Democrats for the shutdown and the impact on SNAP beneficiaries in her state: \"The simplest, fastest solution remains for Democrats to reopen the government and fund programs like SNAP, but in the meantime, my administration will work with our legislators, churches, and food banks to help feed Arkansans.\" Arkansas' DHS is pushing SNAP recipients to find local food pantries, churches and other organizations for temporary food assistance and to check for eligibility of other food programs. As the benefits run dry, some community members have established informal systems to foot their neighbors' grocery bills.

Minutes’ — here’s what happened \n       \n  Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:20 PM EST, Sun November 2, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Trump appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, one year after suing the CBS show over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview — and he was well aware that his answers would similarly be trimmed for time.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to use that one,” Trump remarked after an awkward exchange with interviewer Norah O’Donnell about crime in Washington, D.C.\n \n\n   \n  “You don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” Trump said at another point while praising the new owners of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  The newsmagazine’s producers evidently agreed that those moments weren’t the most newsworthy. CBS News aired about a third of O’Donnell’s sit-down with Trump on TV, and posted  most of the rest  on YouTube. The network also published the complete transcript of the 90-minute interview online.\n \n\n   \n  Both the TV broadcast and the transcript showed that O’Donnell sought to make the most of her time with Trump, pressing him on cost-of-living increases, foreign policy challenges, the government shutdown and other topics.\n \n\n   \n  O’Donnell asked pointed questions: “Are we going to war against Venezuela?” “When will you declare ‘mission accomplished’ on immigration?” “So you’re gonna send the military into American cities?”\n \n\n   \n  During a couple of key moments, O’Donnell pushed back on Trump’s talking points, for example, noting how “when the stock market is doing well, that doesn’t affect everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  Liberal commentators criticized O’Donnell for not interjecting and correcting Trump more often — reprising a decade-old debate within media industry circles about how to interview Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Norah let Trump lie and lie with barely any pushback or provision of corrective facts,” former MSNBC host Joy Reid commented on Bluesky.\n \n\n   \n  But it was not exactly a cushy interview. And O’Donnell’s questions generated lots of news. In one clip that ricocheted around social media, Trump said immigration raids in the US “haven’t gone far enough.” In another viral clip, Trump said, “I don’t know who he is” when asked about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, whom  he pardoned last month .\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemingly had little to say when O’Donnell brought up “those that are suffering with cost-of-living increases and saying they’re living paycheck to paycheck.” He suggested people should blame his predecessor, Joe Biden, and made generic pledges about lowering the price of gas and fixing healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  “But Mr. President, with all due respect, you’ve been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015,” O’Donnell said at one point.\n \n\n   \n  “Sure. And you can’t do it because of the Democrats,” Trump responded.\n \n\n   \n    Praising David Ellison and Bari Weiss\n \n\n   \n  Sit-down interviews with Trump have been few and far between during his second term, so every question and every answer gets attention.\n \n\n   \n  And Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview was even more noteworthy since Trump cares deeply about the newsmagazine but hadn’t said yes to an interview since 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Trump fielded O’Donnell’s questions on Friday, one year to the day after he filed a frivolous lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over its pre-election interview with Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit — along with Trump’s public attacks and threats against CBS station licenses — shook the network and created a conundrum for parent company Paramount, which needed the Trump administration’s approval for its then-pending merger with Skydance Media.\n \n\n   \n  The Paramount board decided to strike a settlement deal, paying $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library to end the litigation.\n \n\n   \n  The settlement was widely criticized, including by journalists and entertainers at CBS. “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert likened it to a “big fat bribe.” (Colbert’s show was cancelled soon thereafter, in  what the network cast  as a financial, not political, decision.)\n \n\n   \n  Within days of the settlement being finalized last July, the Trump administration approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, clearing the way for Skydance boss David Ellison, son of the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to take control of CBS.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has kept tabs on the Paramount ownership change and has expressed hope that CBS will be “fairer” as a result.\n \n\n   \n  “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump said last month. “They will make the right decisions,” he added. “They’re going to revitalize CBS — hopefully, they’ll bring it back to its former glory.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also flattered the Ellisons during the “60 Minutes” taping, saying, “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump specifically brought up David Ellison’s recent hiring of Bari Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief, albeit not by name.\n \n\n   \n  “The young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great — from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person,” Trump said after bringing up the Paramount settlement. (This is one of the parts of the interview that Trump suggested could be trimmed.)\n \n\n   \n  Trump falsely said “60 Minutes” was “forced to pay me a lot of money,” when in fact the settlement was a corporate calculation; CBS could have decided to fight the lawsuit in court, and many legal experts believed the network would have won.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also misstated the timeline, claiming the Harris interview “was election-changing, two nights before the election,” when in fact it aired one month before election day.\n \n\n   \n  CBS disclosed the settlement controversy in O’Donnell’s introduction to the interview broadcast on Sunday night. She noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/harvard-university-goldenson-explosion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-11:02","title":"Officials investigate ‘intentional’ explosion at Harvard University medical building that left no injuries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An apparent intentional explosion occurred at the Goldenson building, a historic medical school facility on Harvard University’s campus, early Saturday morning.

on Saturday in the South Asian archipelago, “marking a historic milestone in the nation’s efforts to protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation,” said the  country’s Ministry of Health. \n \n\n   \n  This measure “makes the Maldives the first country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco ban,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Smoking causes more than seven million

The bill would ban tobacco for anyone born after January 1, 2009, and strengthen regulations on the sale of tobacco and vaping products.\n \n\n   \n  A number of British health leaders signed  an open letter  last week calling for the bill’s passage, and decrying delays in the process so far.

California redistricting Proposition 50 would replace California's current congressional lines with a map favoring Democrats. The maneuver is  Gov. Gavin Newsom's answer  to President Trump pushing  Texas  and  other  GOP-led states to redraw their congressional maps to give Republicans a better chance of hanging onto the party's slim majority in the U.S. House. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If voters approve Prop 50 — which  appears likely  — the new districts could help Democrats win up to five more House seats in the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The proposition  is written to expire  after the 2030 election, returning line-drawing power to the state's existing independent citizens' redistricting commission. —  KQED's Guy Marzorati New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist and frontrunner in the race for mayor of the nation's biggest city, trounced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other Democrats  in the primary  by running a grassroots campaign that inspired  younger voters  through a relentless focus on making New York City more affordable. His primary win energized portions of the party's base, while making him a foil for Republicans across the country. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Cuomo opted to stay in the mayor's race by running  as an independent . He's criticized Mamdani as too inexperienced to deal with Trump. Cuomo has also argued that the state legislator's campaign platform, which includes free buses and universal childcare, can't be delivered. If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and, at 34, its youngest in more than a century. —  WNYC's Brigid Bergin New Jersey governor  The two leading candidates for governor in New Jersey are locked in a tight race. Trump  has been tele-campaigning  for Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former small business owner who narrowly lost the gubernatorial election four years ago. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, held an endorsement rally with former President Barack Obama on Saturday and has a slight edge over Ciattarelli in recent polling. Polls also show issues like  housing affordability  and high electric bills are top of voters' minds, but the contest has been dominated in recent weeks by  personal attacks  on  both sides . If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elect a governor from the same party three terms in a row. —  WNYC's Mike Hayes Virginia governor   Democrats are hopeful that history may be on their side as the party in power in the White House typically loses  the race for governor  in Virginia.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were conducting an immigration enforcement operation at the time. It said agents had observed a “red vehicle” that was “aggressively” tailing their vehicle, and when the agents turned, the car crashed into Border Patrol. DHS said a “hostile crowd” gathered around their vehicle and began “verbally abusing them and spitting on them.”\n \n\n   \n  But Mayor Daniel Biss disputed the agency’s account of the incident in an interview with CNN, calling DHS “a bunch of liars.”\n \n\n   \n  He told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday he is opening two investigations into the incident: one into the “violence” federal agents used against people he described as “innocent bystanders,” and one into the vehicle collision. The Border Patrol agents “deliberately caused a car accident” by intentionally braking while being followed by the red vehicle, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They didn’t like being followed, because they don’t like being watched, because they don’t want the world to know what they’re doing,” said the mayor of the Chicago suburb. “They forced this car accident, and then they started literally beating up innocent bystanders.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked DHS about the mayor’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of  the aggressive tactics  used by Border Patrol and ICE, including against US citizens. Multiple people have been  shot by federal agents  during immigration enforcement operations, and  multiple car crashes  and alleged “rammings” involving federal agents have occurred as DHS sets out to meet  high arrest targets  set by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  DHS said three US citizens were arrested “as a result of their violence against law enforcement” in Evanston on Friday, but the agency did not specify what the three had allegedly done, and did not identify them or list any charges against them.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s questions about the videos showing the man being punched in the head, a DHS spokesperson sent a statement saying a Border Patrol agent had “delivered several defensive strikes” to a person he was arresting. The statement said the man had kicked the agent and “grabbed the (agent’s) genitals and squeezed them” during the arrest, but that account was not readily supported by the video.\n \n\n   \n  Video shows one agent restraining the man, then dragging him around as another agent helps pin him to the ground. As one agent punches the man several times, the man screams, “Help me, help me.” Agents appear to fight off a screaming crowd trying to help the man by pushing them away and threatening them with pepper spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t breathe,” the man says as the agent continues to kneel on him. The agents then drag him into a vehicle, his left shoe lying on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  Biss said that after the man was arrested, federal agents “took him away and booked him and drove him around” but did not take him to receive medical care. The man was “not in good shape” after the arrest, he said. CNN has asked DHS whether it took the man to receive medical care.\n \n\n   \n  “This is lawlessness,” the mayor said. “This is an outrage, and everyone’s got to stand up against it.”\n \n\n   \n  By arresting three US citizens, he said, federal agents “weren’t even trying to enforce immigration. They were just trying to go after dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  Following a new Evanston policy, local police obtained the badge numbers of the federal agents involved in Friday’s arrests, Biss said. “Now we have the first step toward accountability, by being able to identify them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  City officials are “thinking through options, including going to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, or potentially communicating with our state’s attorney to figure out the right way to demand justice for our residents who were assaulted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker  had asked  federal officials to pause immigration enforcement operation in and near homes, schools, parks and other areas where families would be celebrating Halloween over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Wymer, who took videos of the incident, described the agents’ actions as “absolutely deplorable.”\n \n\n   \n  “These agents chose to terrorize our neighborhood on Halloween, a day that is supposed to be special and fun for families,” Wymer said. “This is not normal. This is not OK, and our town will stand with our immigrant neighbors no matter what.”\n \n\n   \n  Five people from Mexico were arrested Friday in Evanston and the neighboring city of Skokie, DHS told CNN. The agency did not specify the reason for each arrest but listed trespassing and entering the United States without authorization, a civil immigration offense.\n \n\n   \n  Local and state officials criticized the immigration operation in the area Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m disgusted and outraged by reports of ICE terrorizing students, families, and community members today in Evanston, Skokie, and across the 9th District,” US Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat,  said on X.  “My team and I are monitoring the situation and coordinating with local partners to protect our neighbors. We won’t tolerate this inhumanity and will defend the dignity of every person in our community.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN on Friday, Biss had a clear message for federal officials: “To Gregory Bovino, Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection: Get the hell out of our city.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5595985","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:40:00-05:00","title":"Los Angeles Celebrates the Dodgers' Back-to-Back World Series Championship","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Los Angeles Dodgers celebrated their back-to-back World Series championships with a parade and stadium rally, marking a historic and emotionally resonant moment for the city.

How about three in six years? How about back-to-back?\" And the team's biggest star,  Shohei Ohtani , speaking in English, which he  does rarely , said, \"I am so happy to be part of this team. I'm ready to get another ring next year.\" Only two teams, the New York Yankees (three times) and the Oakland A's (once) have ever won three consecutive World Series titles. Another Dodger Japanese pitching star, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who was the series' MVP after winning three games, also spoke in English. \"I love the Dodgers. I love Los Angeles.\" The players were serenaded as they traveled on top of double-decker buses during the parade. Adoring fans wearing Dodger caps and jerseys and carrying signs screamed their approval as the buses went by. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm feeling good. We won back-to-back and we just made history. I don't know what to say right now,\" said Dodger fan Charles Ryan as he waited for the players to go by along the 1.7-mile route. Many people took the day off from work and brought their children to take part in the festivities. It was a giant party on some of the same streets where police and protesters were involved in tense confrontations in June over immigration polices. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said before the Monday celebration that after a difficult year, which included deadly wildfires, Los Angeles deserves something positive. \"I will tell you this has been a tough year for Los Angeles, but (this) shows the grit and the spirit of our city, she said. After the parade came the rally at the stadium, which a week ago featured an  18-inning thriller  in Game Three — tying it for the longest World Series game ever. L.A. won it 6-5 on a dramatic walk-off home run by Freddie Freeman. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After the players strolled onto the field through an opening in center field, rapper Ice Cube, a huge Dodger fan, drove a  vintage blue Chevy convertible  containing the World Series trophy. The Dodgers, with baseball's biggest payroll, have used their financial ability to pluck some of the most sought-after and most expensive free agents on the market. It has helped turn them into a powerhouse. One of the beneficiaries of that free spending is L.A. manager Dave Roberts, who did not shy away from discussing the possibility of another title next year. \"I talked to (former NBA coach) Pat Riley and he gave me the ok to use his phrase. What's better than two? Three. Three-peat. Three-peat. Let's go!\" Riley  trademarked the term  \"three-peat\" in 1987 after his Los Angeles Lakers team won three consecutive NBA titles.  One of the most touching moments of the rally occurred when Miguel Rojas, an unexpected hero of the series, addressed the crowd. Rojas, a light-hitting infielder, hit an unexpected home run in the ninth inning of Game Seven to tie it and force extra innings,  when the Dodgers won it .

When Snider hears music, she says, she sometimes wants to eat it — that's how deep the desire goes. She's not traditionally religious, but she has come to see music as a mysterious, divine force within her. That force has been gaining strength ever since the 52-year-old's breakthrough piece,  Penelope , appeared 15 years ago. The song cycle tells the story of a psychologically damaged husband returning from war to a wife who tries to help him find himself again. The piece resonates in Snider's own life, as she's been open about her own struggles with depression and anxiety. The Princeton, N.J., native has had to overcome more than just mental health challenges — her career, still on the rise, has been rife with roadblocks. One of the most significant dates back to her years in post-grad study at the Yale School of Music, where she sometimes felt creatively straitjacketed. She didn't write a note for the first six months she was there, afraid of breaking any of the academically sanctioned rules about what good music should sound like. Finding her own compositional voice wasn't easy, but the warm critical response to  Penelope  helped validate her singular language — one that organically incorporates elements of classical, rock and pop, a blend she once felt ashamed to indulge. One of Snider's greatest assets is her natural facility in writing vocal music; she followed Penelope with another song cycle,  Unremembered  (2015), and the choral work  Mass for the Endangered  (2020), which married environmentalism with the traditional Latin requiem mass. Given the hurdles she's surmounted and her success so far, it's not a shock to learn that the subject of Snider's new opera is  Hildegard von Bingen  — the 12th century German abbess who, against all odds, became a prolific composer, writer, scientist, philosopher and diplomat. Snider says that what Hildegard accomplished in her time, especially as a woman, is a never-ending source of inspiration. From her home in Princeton — where she lives with her husband, the composer Steven Mackey, and their children — Snider joined a video chat to talk about  Hildegard , how her health intersects with her work, and the genesis of New Amsterdam, the influential record label she co-founded. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Tom Huizenga: In your upcoming opera about the medieval abbess Hildegard von Bingen, there's a scene where celestial voices tell Hildegard, \"Know thyself, find your strength.\" It made me pause and think: Those words could probably serve as your own personal motto. Sarah Kirkland Snider:  You get at the heart of one of the reasons I became so interested in Hildegard. In my early readings about her, one of the pervasive themes of her life was self-doubt and anxiety, and that's certainly been true for me, too. I think that's true for a lot of people. Just speaking for myself, as a woman who was raised by conservative Southern traditional parents to be a certain kind of girl — that meant pleasing others, downplaying my own needs, not sharing my own point of view. My parents meant well; it was the way they were raised. For women like me, who've had that experience, it certainly can be daunting to try to assert oneself in the world, artistically or personally. And when you're an artist, you have to constantly assert yourself. You have to put your artistic point of view forward and believe in it, and all of that can be very daunting. So that was part of my initial interest in Hildegard — in a time and place where women weren't supposed to be seen or heard, how did she conquer those fears and defy societal norms to accomplish everything that she did? Most composers are, at some point, searching for their voice, finding themselves musically, learning how to navigate the classical music marketplace — and then playing to their strengths. Do you have a clear picture of the composer part of yourself, and your strengths? I do feel like I have a much stronger sense of that than I did when I was younger. I still have enormous self-doubt and I'm relentlessly self-critical. But overall, I do feel like I trust my instincts more as a creative person. I know what my strengths are and I try to lean into them. My strengths are really my interests. I'm very interested in melody and harmony, atmosphere, emotion and storytelling. I'm interested in communication and emotional immediacy. These are things that I was not necessarily encouraged to pursue when I was in graduate school or in my early years of study. I'm not going to ask you \"Why Hildegard?\" because she's an endlessly fascinating figure. But what specifically about her appeals most to you? I have chronic intractable migraine, and apparently so did Hildegard. I actually first learned about her reading a book by the neurologist Oliver Sacks, who theorized that Hildegard's visions were in part due to her auras she experienced during her migraines. He mentioned that she was a composer, and that made me curious to learn about her music. But beyond that, I wanted to know more about her visions, so I started reading books about her life, and from there I just became absolutely transfixed. I had no idea what she had accomplished — the fact that she was a woman in the Middle Ages when women were not allowed to be educated, and went on to gain papal approval to be the first woman ever to speak as the voice of God and say that she was receiving visions directly from God. She was called a prophet, the first woman in the Catholic Church's history to be given that title, and published her visions. She was very savvy — she couldn't just come out and try to radically change everything. She needed to play the game in order to have the church give her credibility. And I find that fascinating. How important was it for you to put Hildegard in a romantic relationship with another woman in your opera? We know that a young nun named Richardis von Stade came to the abbey where Hildegard lived and became her assistant, but the jury is still out on whether their relationship was erotically charged or not.  There was so much to share about her life and what she accomplished, but my initial drafts of the opera were a little too academic and dry. I remember [the opera producer] Beth Morrison saying to me, \"You know, this is an opera, not a dissertation.\" I realized I needed to get at these ideas in a more human, relatable, universal kind of way — and I thought I would use her relationship with Richardis as a way of dealing with her philosophical teachings in regards to her own life and everyday experience. We're not sure whether there was an erotically charged relationship. Historical documents seem to show that she certainly had very strong feelings for Richardis, feelings that were discouraged by Benedictine tradition — but I wondered, what was that like for her internally? I kept having to remind myself that what opera does best is deal with emotions, and particularly complex, layered emotions that are not just primary colors, but where you can use harmony to really get at complication and internal dissonance. Because Hildegard was a composer, I'm curious how you determined what kind of sound world you wanted for the opera? Were you tempted to write your music in a kind of medieval-influenced style? One of my first reactions to Hildegard's music when I first heard it in my 20s was a feeling of affinity, because she has this penchant for large leaps and melismatic writing — lots of notes per syllable. And that was something I was doing when I first started composing. So inhabiting her musical world enabled me, in some ways, to go deeper into my own. That sounds strange, perhaps, but I tried to use her music as a springboard for a lot of my ideas in certain places. Like, I wanted it to have overall an early music vibe, but I also didn't want to feel like I was trying to rewrite her music or inhabit her point of view. Hildegard's reputation has soared in the last half century or so, primarily as a result of the increasing interest in early music. What can we learn from her and her music, more than 900 years after her birth?  Oh my gosh, so much. In a way, it's sad to see how little has changed in certain respects. Of course, women have many more rights now than they did then, but a lot of the struggles that she faced resonate with women today. And not just with women, anyone who is marginalized by society, government, family systems. Looking at the way she went into her struggles and came out with this life of self-direction and creative accomplishment with such tremendous panache is very inspiring. Furthermore, there's a plotline in the opera about how Richardis endures a rape and a pregnancy — which is still resonant today, obviously. And there's even an unsympathetic helicopter mom who bulldozes in and whisks Richardis away from Hildegard. And that's true for a lot of gender expectations from families today, right? That was all about Richardis not fitting the mold of a traditional girl who was interested in boys and court. Instead, she was interested in making art, and she was gay — and, because she was different from other girls, she was sent off to a convent. We have infinite versions of that today, where people are denied love and acceptance for who they are. And so ultimately, one of the central themes, and the note that we end on in the opera, is about Hildegard recognizing who she is and accepting that. This is where the opera is not a biopic, it's a combination of fact and my own invention. You were born and raised in New Jersey, in a not-very-musical household — but there must have been some music floating in the air when you were a kid. What were you and your parents listening to? My parents did not listen to classical music at home. It was 24/7 pop, rock, Motown and Broadway. My dad was a big music lover and played records by The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Wonder, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell and Simon & Garfunkel. And I loved all of that music deeply. I began piano lessons at 6 or 7, and then started cello in fifth grade and played in the orchestras and kids' chamber music groups. And what was wonderful about that upbringing was that I didn't have anybody telling me that pop or rock music was low art and that classical was high art. I thought all of it was just music. Whereas I think a lot of my peers in classical music, who grew up with classical music parents, had a lot of preconceived ideas about pop and rock being bad. What was hard for me was, when I got serious about music — having those impulses for emotional immediacy — being steered away from that by my teachers because the impulses were associated with the world of pop and rock. Music is all about emotional immediacy. For me, classical music, at least everything up until pretty much the early 20th century, is also about emotional immediacy. So it was hard for me to understand why we were suddenly not supposed to do that when there were hundreds of years of great art and music that  did  do that — that managed to be both artistic and stimulating on visceral and emotional and cerebral levels. I think we can hear those pop influences in your music. If I had to imagine a Sarah Kirkland Snider Top 40 hit, it would definitely be \"The Lotus Eaters\" from your song cycle  Penelope , which has great hooks and a great chorus you just want to sing along with, like any good pop song. It's funny — that song came so quickly and strangely to me, because I'd taken my husband to the hospital for a minor medical procedure. I was in the waiting room and brought my computer, and I just immediately heard these melodies. I was thinking actually about one of my favorite pieces of songwriting, by Radiohead — they're probably my all-time favorite. Indeed, one of my favorite bands, too. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       I was thinking about \" Karma Police ,\" which goes to this wonderful unexpected place; the song sort of levitates and you're suddenly in this other dimension when the lyrics go, \"For a minute there, I lost myself.\" I wanted to do that in \"The Lotus Eaters\" with the line \"And I'm lost in this night.\" I was taught in graduate school that when an idea comes to you easily, you should reject it, because it probably means that you've heard it somewhere else before, and you should try to be more imaginative. That is such a toxic message for a creative person, because then you're constantly second-guessing all of your ideas. I have to credit my husband, who's also a composer, because he sat me down and said, \"You know, what you need is therapy, not composition lessons. These are beautiful, great ideas and you just have too much dogma that you've internalized. Just commit to it.\" I'm guessing that that internal conflict was part of the fuel that helped you — and fellow composers Judd Greenstein and William Brittelle — found the influential record label New Amsterdam in 2008. Judd and Bill and I felt like music should be a place where people of our generation and our interests can find some cultural resonance — not look at a record album cover and see a picture of people in gowns and tuxedos. Honestly, we wanted to create a space to make the music that we wanted to make, that we felt we couldn't make when we were in graduate school. This was happening about the same time that I was writing  Penelope . Judd and Bill came to see a performance and they said, \"This is exactly the music we should record for New Amsterdam.\" And I was like, \"Oh, no. This is just a side project, I can't let this out into the real world.\" And they said, \"Sarah, do you realize how hypocritical this is? You're saying that we should have freedom. And yet you feel shame about this music.\" They basically dared me, and supported me tremendously. We put out the album, and I think it was just at the right moment. It struck a chord with a lot of people. I was utterly gobsmacked by the critical reception of  Penelope . I was expecting it to just come and go under the radar and use it as a guinea pig for New Amsterdam. And it not only did well critically, but I received all of these emails from classical people wanting to commission me. I was like, you've got to be kidding me. This is basically rock music with some weirdness thrown in — very on the fence between rock and classical. It helped launch your career, and the record label, too. Fairly soon, New Amsterdam seemed to epitomize a style that was called, for better or for worse, \"indie classical\" — implying a blend of classical and indie rock. How do you feel about that descriptor? I'm not a big fan of it. I think it got stuck on us early on because we were very DIY in terms of our approach. We didn't know what we were doing starting a label; we didn't understand how much work it would be. It was very \"indie\" in terms of our approach to the infrastructure of setting up a label, and then that got merged with the idea of the music we were making. It's an unfortunate descriptor because it subjects the inhabitants to a false universalism — not everybody writing so-called \"indie classical\" sounds the same. It also suggests that the music is lightweight, and that's unfortunate. I think there can be rigor in all kinds of music. In one  interview  from 10 years ago, you pointed out what you called a \"lack of infrastructure to support music written in the cracks between\" the classical and pop music worlds. Has that changed at all in the past decade?   Yes, I think there's a lot more support, but it's still difficult to build a career. If you look at somebody like  Julia Holter , she's finding a way to make it work. I don't think she has a teaching job — she just makes music and tours, and she's doing really interesting work in the cracks. But if you can't market something, it's very hard to find an audience for it. Even today, some might say you have more access, and you can get your music out in any way. But there's so much music out there, almost too much music to really be seen and heard unless you can get writers interested and find your way above the fray. My husband teaches at Princeton, and there are a lot of composers there who are doing very interesting work in the cracks that they wouldn't have been doing, I think, 10 years ago. I've seen, more and more, the changing of the guard — younger teachers coming in, more open-mindedness. You've been refreshingly open-minded about your own struggles. I remember a beautifully honest Facebook post you wrote in 2020 where you said, \"I'm Sarah. And on World Mental Health Day, I'm writing to say that I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder … that anxiety and depression are a result of imbalanced chemistry in the brain, the same way diabetes is a result of insufficient insulin in the pancreas, and should not be stigmatized.\" It must have taken some real courage to write that. It was courage. But also, I immediately regretted it afterwards. Really? Yes, and no. When I woke up in the morning, I had a panic attack that I had done it. It took a lot of reassurance from people coming forward and telling me how much it meant to them for me to realize that it was indeed the right thing to do. I think I got to a place of feeling so tired of hiding it. I have two kids who are neurodivergent; my son has mild autism spectrum disorder and my daughter has mild Tourette's. They certainly have the potential to develop some anxiety and depression around these issues. I felt a strong impulse to be the voice that I was craving hearing, saying that it's OK to talk about these things. I grew up in a family where it was definitely not OK to talk about these things. Even now, as I'm saying these words, I'm feeling embarrassed to admit that I have struggled with depression. It's just so deeply ingrained in me for that to be a shameful thing. But when more people do what you bravely did, more people will get the help they need without feeling that shame. Thank you. I don't want to be presumptuous, but I imagine it can get in the way of your work. For sure. My depressive episodes have always been concomitant with intractable migraine. And it's always been unclear: Is the depression causing the migraine? Is the migraine causing the depression? It's very difficult to tease these things apart because it's been my life since childhood. In the deepest part of my soul, I believe that the migraine came first — because now my migraines are better, and I'm generally less anxious. I'm a very optimistic person by nature; my husband always says, \"You're the most optimistic depressive I've ever met.\" I really have a strong sense of hope and believe in the good in the universe. But I can get terribly sad and melancholy, and it has definitely interfered with my work, most significantly during COVID. The years 2020 and 2021 were very hard years. A lot of my performances and commissions were canceled and I stopped being able to write. I was supposed to have this big New York Philharmonic premiere, and I felt like my whole career had been painstakingly leading up to that moment, struggling to get my foot in the door of the orchestral world, which is a really hard one to break into. I also had this commission and found out that it was going to be put off for two more years — the same for the release of the recording of my  Mass for the Endangered . Both of these things were going to help launch a new phase. Suddenly, I felt like, by the time that all these things wind down, I'm going to be forgotten. My headaches got much worse, I had a 15-month migraine with almost no interruption and became severely depressed. I'm so sorry. And I wasn't properly medicated because of all the shame I carry about my anxiety and depression. It got to the point where not only did I stop writing, but I was crying all the time and not sleeping for, like, six months. I finally went to see a new psychiatrist and he said, \"This is major depressive disorder,\" which was the first time that I'd heard that diagnosis. And so committing to that in the Facebook post was, I think, part of my way of really trying to force myself to embrace it. It is really important that we talk about it; we need to destigmatize and make people feel like it's not weird and shameful, because it is so common. Well, I was going to ask this question, but maybe it's not appropriate. No, go ahead. I'm an open book. Does it ever work the other way? I mean, can it sort of help you in certain circumstances? For example, I'm thinking about what rich, poignant portraits you created in  Penelope  — the emotionally damaged character and the person who tries to bring him back to himself. Can you tap into that musically in a special way because of your own struggles? I think we are at our best when we're the most honest. We all have so many deep feelings that come from our lived experiences, and they're such an important source of inspiration if we let them be. And in the case of the man coming from back from war, of course I haven't been to war. But I know what it's like to feel very oppressed, to feel like you don't know yourself because you're walking on eggshells and trying to keep peace, and then what it's like to find yourself again. I did a lot of writing in journals as a kid; that was my greatest source of therapy. The reason it was so helpful to me was because I would allow myself to access all the feelings I was repressing. I have always strongly identified with people who have to repress things or are losing and burying parts of themselves. What touched me about the story was the idea of this man trying to figure out who he was beneath all the layers of trauma. Emotion in music is something important to you.  You once said , \"Nothing puts me more directly in touch with the feeling of being alive, of being human, than music.\" What is it about music, specifically, that makes you feel that way? I've always had a strong physical relationship to music. The hair on my arms stands on end frequently when I listen; I get chills. In fact, I remember having a sensation of wanting to  eat  music, like an apple. I still get this from time to time, where I'll be in an orchestral rehearsal and the harp will play a note, and I have this impulse to put it in my mouth. It's this funny feeling of needing to get music inside of me. My kids get upset with me sometimes because a certain song will come on and I can't listen to it, because of either what it will do to me emotionally in that moment, or it reminds me too powerfully of something unpleasant, or I have such a strong physical reaction. They're like, \"Mom, don't be a snob.\" And I'm like, \"It's not about snobbery. It's about incapacitation.\" I've had similar reactions — it hasn't happened often, but I've hyperventilated and also experienced extreme euphoria at concerts. Daniel Levitin, a neuroscientist I've  interviewed  who wrote the book  This is Your Brain on Music , says it's a real chemical reaction that happens in your brain. Yes. I've always told my kids music is like a drug — the only really good kind of drug for you. It seems like your career is really still ascending, and now you're staking your flag in the opera world with  Hildegard , claiming important new territory. Where do you see your music going?    I don't know that I have grand plans, except that I really want to be doing as many bigger pieces as I can. I loved writing this opera. It was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done, and I would like to do more of it. I want to write orchestral music, more choral music. I loved writing  Mass for the Endangered . I like writing these big pieces that I can really sink my teeth into and have different ideas come back and return. I am very traditional in the sense that I like to develop my materials quite a bit and I'm very interested in seeing how much mileage I can get out of an idea and how I can bring it back later in a different way. I'm very nerdy in the sense that I love being able to study other composers' music, from 200 years ago or whatever, and find the Easter eggs of how they inverted this or augmented that. Large canvases give you a bigger chance to do that. Are you at your artistic peak? I feel like I've really hit a stride in terms of enjoying writing music. I've been really happy composing in the past 10 years in a way that I wasn't before. At certain points of writing this opera, I was really tearing my hair out and it was tough. But I feel like there's this parallel with Hildegard. She came into a second birth after she got her papal permission. And then she established her own abbey and began turning out a tremendous amount of music and writing. She finally came into her sense of confidence and self-belief. I feel like — maybe to answer your very first question — this is confirmation that I must be getting there myself, because I have a lot more joy in the process now than I used to. So I'm just looking forward to continuing that as long as I can. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live music performances by artists in a minimalist, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","music","featured performances","live music","intimate concerts"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5538425","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-04:00","title":"A photographer captures life inside Chicago Public Schools","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melissa Ann Pinney, a Chicago-based photographer, spent seven years photographing students in Chicago Public Schools as part of her ongoing project 'Becoming Themselves', focusing on marginalized and underrepresented youth.

\n        \n        \n      \n\n         Melissa Ann Pinney photographed the everyday moments of adolescence inside Chicago Public Schools during a seven-year artist residency. Her series  Becoming Themselves  portrays students, especially those marginalized and underrepresented, as they navigate identity, community and the many transformations of growing up. We interviewed Pinney about the making of her series and the stories behind some of her favorite images. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. What drew you to photograph inside Chicago Public Schools? I was invited by Artists in Public Schools, an organization that pairs artists for residencies in schools all over the city, to photograph Bell School and Ogden International Schools. It was an incredible opportunity to photograph and immerse myself in often overlooked communities of children and teens in Chicago. Since I was in my teens and photographing my own family, childhood and adolescence has been a focus of my work.  Girl Ascending , my 2010 monograph, explored the social lives and coming-of-age rituals of my daughter, Emma, her friends and teammates. The possibilities inherent in widening the scope of my work beyond these established personal connections was exciting. When you first started, what kinds of images or stories did you hope to capture? I'm interested in photography as a process, one of paying close attention to the richness and mystery already present in the everyday world. I capture what's happening in the moment, and the story reveals itself afterwards in contemplation of the work itself. This is an opportunity to make what I think of as real pictures — images that reward sustained and repeated viewings and eschew stereotype and cliché. I had no idea what to expect in the schools, but through trial and error, I found opportunities to make pictures as I became part of the school community. I never know what the students will do next — their beauty, their compassion and their conflicts are unrehearsed. The teens collaborate in the art-making by welcoming me into their world. My photographs are both documents of a time and place and works of art. References to contemporary culture, to history and to ideas of representation are all embedded in the pictures. When I began photographing students in three different Chicago public schools, I had no idea of what was to come — how the project would evolve and shift through an ongoing global pandemic, a renewed focus on systemic racial and gender inequities and rampant gun violence. Now it's a document of a historic time. How much time did you spend working on  Becoming Themselves ? This project is ongoing and still evolving since 2018, when I started photographing in Bell School.  In Their Own Light  was the first book of my early pictures from an elementary, middle and several high schools. In  Becoming Themselves,  I   focus solely on two high schools — Ogden International High School and Senn High School — between 2019 and 2025. What was the most challenging part of this project? It is very hard to witness the grief and ongoing trauma many students experience as part of their everyday lives, especially when we hear that a student in the community has been shot and killed. Tragically, eight students I photographed died that way. The trauma of gun violence reverberates everywhere. What's the story behind one of your favorite photographs? With her My Little Pony leggings and arms loaded with jewelry, Lizzie Williams clearly stood out in the hallway crowded with students at their lockers gathering their coats and bags. I introduced myself and asked if Lizzie wanted to make a portrait. We went to the old gym for its brilliant light and huge south-facing windows. In the midst of working out Lizzie's pose and position, the boys basketball team starting running laps around the gym, casting shadows onto the wall where Lizzie stood. At first I was annoyed by this unexpected disruption, but I soon realized that, far from an unwelcome distraction, the shadows suggest another level of mystery and complexity. I'm grateful for serendipity! The DePaul University Art Museum added this photograph and six others from the project to their permanent collection last spring. A class of Senn students, many of whom are represented in the photographs, took a field trip to the museum to see the works. Were there any moments that surprised you during the process? Many moments surprised me. One day early last fall, a student I hadn't met before asked me to take his picture. I was happy to do so and we found a place by the windows with some light. When I looked through my lens, I suddenly recognized Axle, a student I'd first met two years before, when he transferred to Senn. I had photographed him several other times. Axle had transformed himself radically with a new short hair cut and different style of dress. I am always surprised and moved when a student tells me that the project made a positive impact on their life. Travion Williams, at Ogden International High School, said he was shy, self-conscious and unsure of himself when we made his portrait in 2019. Travion's portrait was one of the 84 portraits installed on panels in the school's front lobby in the summer of 2020. Classes would be completely online that fall, but outdoor sports were still allowed. When the cross country team started practicing, Travion discovered that his friends and teammates recognized and admired him. It changed the way he saw himself. It's rewarding when I'm told by a student that my work is important to them. As my ties to the community have deepened — I've come to understand the meaning this project holds for me and for the students themselves, who tell me they feel truly \"seen\" by participating in the project. The students have profoundly affected the ways I understand the lives of others; my relationships now transcend school to include family events, parties and baby showers. I couldn't have predicted the strong connections I would develop with some of the students, who keep in touch even years after they've graduated. When I brought Sophiat Agboola a print of her portrait, she told me it was inspiring. Surprised, I asked in what way it was inspiring and to whom — I couldn't guess. Sophiat said she had occasionally been made fun of for wearing her natural hair; her portrait had given her the confidence to do so. Of course, the pandemic surprised me. And the fact that a project I expected to last one year could still be challenging and rewarding after seven was a complete surprise, too. Do you have any memorable anecdotes or encounters from your time in the schools ? I photographed Jakolbi Lard only once, at prom in 2019, drawn by the broken heart he had shaved in to his hair. In January 2022, I learned that Jakolbi had been shot and killed. Jakolbi's death and the passage of time bring a different perspective to the broken heart shaved into his scalp. Now I see the wings formed by the mirror frame behind Jakolbi's back. Jakolbi's mother, Patricia Lard, told me that rather than being heartbroken, he was the heart-breaker. She brought Jakolbi's daughter, Jamyah, to an exhibition that included Jakolbi's portrait in 2023. She believes that exhibiting Jakolbi's portrait honors his life. Ms. Lard thanked me for \"... seeing in her Sun (sic) what the world did not.\" Has working in schools changed how you think about education or childhood? The students have a lot more agency than kids in my generation or even my daughter's generation did. These students are free to define themselves through their chosen teams and clubs, their dress, sexual orientation, pronouns and sometimes taking on a new name. There's a freedom in the acceptance and allowance for difference I see and a closeness in the physical camaraderie between many of the students. I started reading the news more closely when I began this project. CPS (Chicago Public Schools) and the CTU (the Chicago Teachers Union) are frequently in the headlines. It's clear that Chicago's past is linked to its present by a history of events affecting the city in housing, education, racial and gender equity and immigration. All of these issues flow through the permeable wall between the city and the public schools. What do you hope viewers take away from seeing these images? I hope these pictures encourage a deeper consideration and appreciation of the radiant young people in our public schools that goes far beyond the stereotypes. I intend these portraits to honor and commemorate those who are vulnerable and often underrepresented. Melissa Ann Pinney is an artist based in Chicago.

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\" There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming; toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood. But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin. While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — the one in Iraq. Ordinary To Extraordinary The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House. Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34. It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam. \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\" War, A Recurring Theme In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush. This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision. \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\" Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton. Changing The Vice Presidency — And Foreign Policy The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney. In office, Cheney became a lightning rod for critics of the administration. Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in policy shaping. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House. The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's  Meet the Press , Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House. \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,' \" Cheney said, adding, \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\" After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, pre-emptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy. On  Meet the Press , Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle. \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said. As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that he had changed from his earlier days in politics. Controversy follows Cheney And while Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year. \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\" There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless. Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high ranking in the government as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch. Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News. On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Obama was sworn in. Now Cheney has died, leaving a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government, and leaving a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5551126","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Could smaller families 'rewild' the planet — and make humans happier?","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the global trend of smaller families, driven by women's choices to delay or forgo motherhood, and examines its implications for the environment, economy, and human well-being.

   By Brian Mann \n        \n           Saturday, November 1, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has  lost about 6% of its population  since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\" Upsides: More choice and a huge decline in teen pregnancy The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two,  according to the latest United Nations data .   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has  fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\"  of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without  large-scale immigration, the U.S.  will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-Díaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss,  in a July interview with NPR . \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls.  Research shows delaying motherhood  and having fewer children  often leads to more education, more financial security  and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorová points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.  One question is how to fund the social safety net and healthcare for rising numbers of elderly, when there are fewer young people. John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition.   \"If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated to figuring how a declining population could support its elders, we would achieve that goal,\" he said. \"I think we'd have a happier world, for people and wildlife.\"  \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The first time in modern history, the world's human population is expected to level off and then begin to shrink later this century. It is a trend that will pose a huge challenge as communities begin to age. But as part of our series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing The World, we look today at what might be some of the benefits. NPR's Brian Mann has been speaking to thinkers and activists who welcome a planet with fewer people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: On a late autumn day, John Davis treks through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley - flaming red maple trees, yellow birch. Not so long ago, Davis says there were people here working this land. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) JOHN DAVIS: Some of this was farmed as recently as, I believe, the 1990s. We're seeing old stone walls. It was probably used for sheep pasture some and certainly for logging. MANN: This place is an example of what Davis calls rewilding. DAVIS: Simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will. MANN: This part of New York state, Essex County, has lost about 6% of its population since 2010 because of migration and the low birth rate. It's a trend happening in a growing number of regions in more and more countries. This kind of slow depopulation worries many economists and business leaders. But Davis, an environmental activist who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, thinks it's overdue. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) DAVIS: I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population. I believe that we are too many and that we consume too much. We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people. MANN: The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged everything from climate change to the loss of wildlife. Here's the fascinating thing. That small family ethic he mentioned, it's already here. Over roughly that same period, beginning in the 1960s, researchers say family size worldwide dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman, on average, to roughly two. In most countries, outside sub-Saharan Africa, population growth has slowed almost to zero, and in many areas, population decline is a reality. Marian Starkey's family is helping shape that trend. MARIAN STARKEY: I just really wanted to do other things with my life. MANN: Starkey says she and her husband decided not to have kids. She works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of this shift towards smaller families and gradual depopulation. Fewer people means a healthier environment, Starkey says. But she also thinks it's good for humans. STARKEY: The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, so making sure that all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in a lot of parts of the world, especially for girls. MANN: Now, again, NPR has spoken to a lot of experts deeply concerned about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have long relied on growth will function as communities age and begin to decline. But we also wanted to hear from people convinced this is a hopeful moment. Claudia Goldin is an economist at Harvard who thinks fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier making their own choices - when and if to have kids. CLAUDIA GOLDIN: To have the number of children that they would like to have and to have them at the right time in their lives is certainly a benefit to couples. MANN: It's important to say none of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR want policies that force people to have fewer kids. Instead, they support access to reproductive freedom and contraception. Goldin and other experts say the biggest single upside to this trend towards smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls. Research shows delaying motherhood and having fewer children can lead to more education, more financial security and better health. Vladimira Kantorova is the lead population scientist at the United Nations. VLADIMIRA KANTOROVA: It's something which is a very positive development in the history of mankind. MANN: Kantorova says much of the falling birth rate in the U.S. and around the world reflects one more positive, a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. KANTOROVA: So this is something which is really a success story. MANN: Even those who see big upsides in this population shift agree smaller families and declining birth rates will mean turbulence and policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult. One big question is how to fund the social safety net and health care for rising numbers of elderly when there are fewer young people. (SOUNDBITE OF LEAVES CRUNCHING) MANN: John Davis says he doesn't have answers to all those challenges, but he's hopeful people will find ways to navigate this transition. DAVIS: If the smartest young minds in the world were dedicated toward figuring out how a declining population can support its elders, we would achieve that goal. I think we'd have a happier world for people and wildlife. MANN: Most experts agree smaller families are here to stay. People who cheerlead lower population say it's time to lean into that change, planning and working to make sure the benefits outweigh the costs. Brian Mann, NPR News.

results. It's a drug advertising loophole \n         By Sydney Lupkin \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         If you've googled \"weight loss,\" there's a good chance that one of the first search results that came up was a website for Ozempic. But Ozempic hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight loss — it's only approved to treat Type 2 diabetes. So why is it showing up there? The answer is something called a  sponsored  search result. Companies pay search engines so that their websites are among the first results you see, if you enter certain keywords or phrases. \"Search engines are often the first place people go when they have health questions,\" says  Daniel Eisenkraft Klein , a research fellow at the  Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law  at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.  \"Pharmaceutical companies have figured out how to game that system with pay-per-click ads, which are essentially their way of buying their way to the top of search results,\" he added. Normally, drug companies have to follow strict rules when it comes to advertising their products in magazines or television commercials.  They have to do things like disclose risks or side effects of the drug, and they can't advertise a drug to treat a condition it hasn't been FDA-approved to treat, even if doctors may sometimes prescribe that drug \"off label,\" to treat other conditions. If they do, the companies can get in trouble with the FDA. The idea is to prevent ads containing false or misleading material that can potentially hurt someone. But online sponsored search results, which usually appear on top of other results, aren't regulated the way TV ads are. The law hasn't caught up to the changing technology. Eisenkraft Klein and his colleagues looked at two years of paid search results for Ozempic sponsored by the drug's maker, Novo Nordisk.  They  published their study results  in the medical journal JAMA Network Open. They found that 11 percent of the search keywords or phrases the company paid for contained the word 'weight' even though Ozempic isn't approved for weight loss. They also found that Novo Nordisk paid for search results even when the keywords referred to the drug's main competitors, such as Trulicity and Mounjaro, manufactured by Eli Lilly. \"Novo Nordisk sponsored the search term 'Kelly Clarkson weight loss', presumably because those searching for celebrities and weight loss might be interested in their product,\" Eisenkraft Klein says. The researchers focused only on Ozempic for their study, and more research is needed to look into sponsored results for other drugs and therapeutics, he says. Still, Eisenkraft Klein says the study can be a lesson for consumers: \"Don't assume that Google is showing you the most relevant information. Just because it's first doesn't mean it's the most objective, or the most relevant.\" He recommended scrolling past the sponsored search results and looking for independent sources, such as academic medical centers, when doing medication research online. Contacted by NPR for comment, Novo Nordisk spokeswoman Liz Skrbkova said in an email the study misrepresents the company's \"paid search approach,\" which she says uses \"industry-standard\" capabilities to reach consumers. Novo Nordisk is in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, she added, as well as its own ethical standards, \"so that patients can find information about our medicines to make shared decisions with their healthcare professionals about their care.\" The United States is one of the only countries that allows direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs.  The Trump administration signed a memo calling on the FDA to  crack down on prescription drug advertising  in September, saying companies had been lax about disclosing risks.  The FDA also sent out a  slew of enforcement letters  to companies about their drug ads. The FDA is committed to making sure that promotional communications for prescription drugs are \"truthful, balanced and accurately communicated,\" according to an email from Emily Hilliard, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency for the FDA. She also encouraged people to report concerns to the agency's  Bad Ad Program . A Google spokesman, Nate Funkhouser, said in a statement to NPR that it has clear  policies  for advertising prescription drugs: \"Advertisers are fully responsible for ensuring their advertising strategy, including all keywords and content, adheres to regulatory requirements.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96413","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00Z","title":"Israel rocked by scandal as top military lawyer is thrown into jail","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Maj.

Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the Israeli army's top lawyer.

The video shows part of an assault in which Israeli soldiers are accused of sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee. By leaking the video last year, Tomer-Yerushalmi aimed to expose the seriousness of the allegations her office was investigating. Instead, it triggered fierce criticism from Israel's hard-line political leaders. After Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned under pressure last week, her critics continued to heave personal insults. She left a cryptic note for her family and abandoned her car near a beach. That led to fears she had taken her own life and prompted an intensive search that included the use of military drones. She was found alive at the beach Sunday night, at which point more vitriol against her was unleashed. \"We can resume the lynch,\" right-wing TV personality Yinon Magal, an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, posted on X with a winking-face emoji. After it was revealed that one of Tomer-Yerushalmi's phones had disappeared, right-wing politicians and commentators began to accuse her of staging a suicide attempt as a way to destroy potential evidence. The extraordinary episode shows two years of devastating war have done little to heal a country that was deeply divided even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It also makes Tomer-Yerushalmi the latest in a long line of top security officials who have either left office or been forced out, most of them to be replaced by people considered loyal to Netanyahu and his hardline government. Anger over leak distracts from severe abuse at heart of case At a court hearing Monday, the judge said Tomer-Yerushalmi's detention would be extended until Wednesday on suspicion of committing fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. While the investigation into her actions continues, she is being held at a women's prison in central Israel. Israeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested in connection with the leak investigation. The prime minister's office has refused to comment on Solomesh's arrest. The fury over the leaked video reveals the depth of polarization in Israel — and at least for the moment, keeps the media and the public focused on the leak and not the allegations of abuse. The assault occurred on July 5, 2024, at the Sde Teiman military prison, according to the indictment against the accused soldiers. The AP has investigated allegations of inhumane treatment and abuse at Sde Teiman that predate those in the surveillance video. The video, which has been aired by Israeli news, shows soldiers taking a detainee into an area they cordoned off with shields in an apparent attempt to hide their actions. The indictment said the soldiers assaulted the Palestinian prisoner and sodomized him with a knife, causing multiple injuries. A medical staffer familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety said the detainee arrived at a civilian hospital in life-threatening condition with blunt trauma to the abdomen and the chest and fractured ribs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said the detainee underwent surgery for a perforated rectum and was released back to Sde Teiman days later. The staffer said it was the most extreme abuse case he was familiar with from Sde Teiman. When military police came to Sde Teiman in July to detain the soldiers suspected of abuse, they scuffled with protesters opposed to the arrests. Later, hundreds of violent protesters broke into the detention center. In her resignation letter, Tomer-Yerushalmi wrote that she had exposed evidence of the abuse to counter the idea that the military was unfairly targeting its own soldiers. That idea was creating a danger to the military's law enforcement, she said, citing the break-in. She wrote that the military had a \"duty to investigate when there is reasonable suspicion of violence against a detainee. \"Unfortunately, this basic understanding — that there are actions which must never be taken even against the vilest of detainees — no longer convinces everyone,\" she wrote. The Palestinian detainee who was the subject of the alleged abuse in the video was released back to Gaza last month as part of an exchange between living hostages and Palestinian prisoners, according to documents from the military prosecutor's office obtained by the AP. The case is still pending before the military court. A web of legal issues Three separate legal issues must be sorted out as part of Israel's investigation into what happened at Sde Teiman, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute. The first relates to evidence that Israeli soldiers abused Palestinian detainees while they were in detention. The second is whether Israeli civilians, including members of parliament, tried to disrupt the investigation by breaking into the military base where the soldiers accused of the actions were being held. The third is whether Tomer-Yerushalmi allegedly committed a host of offenses, including fraud, to undermine the investigation into how the surveillance video was leaked to the media. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The intense rhetoric over the past few days is reminiscent of what it was like in Israel immediately before the Oct. 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza, Plesner said. At the time, the public was deeply divided over Netanyahu's push to overhaul the judiciary. The concern for a few hours Sunday night about Tomer-Yerushalmi's fate should serve as a \"stop sign\" to the Israeli public — and especially to commentators who derided her personally, Plesner said. \"It was very sad to see how the internal discourse can bring about such potentially tragic outcome on a personal level,\" Plesner said. It felt especially symbolic, he said, that Tomer-Yerushalmi was in court while the Israeli government held its official memorial ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the assassination of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Many regard the assassination as Israel's lowest point in terms of divisions and incitement among the Israeli public, and worry that the dramatic events of the weekend foreshadow Israel's return to a similar period of internal strife. \"It was very sad to see how the internal discourse can bring about such potentially tragic outcome on a personal level,\" Plesner said. \"There's a way how to debate our differences in a democratic society.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591157","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:54:00-04:00","title":"Public Workers Could Be Denied Loan Forgiveness if Cities Defy Trump, Lawsuit Alleges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of cities—including Albuquerque, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco—along with major public sector unions and 21 state attorneys general, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over a proposed rule change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

alleges \n         By Cory Turner \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 3, 2025 • 12:54 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         The cities of Albuquerque, N.M., Boston, Chicago and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over changes it plans to make to the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, or PSLF. The lawsuit, which also includes the nation's two largest teachers unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, comes less than a week after the U.S. Department of Education  published a rule change  to PSLF. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Effective July 1, 2026, the department says the change will allow it to deny loan forgiveness to workers whose government or nonprofit employers engage in activities with a \"substantial illegal purpose.\" The job of defining \"substantial illegal purpose\" will fall not to the courts but to the education secretary. PSLF was created by Congress in 2007, and signed by then-President George W. Bush, to cancel the federal student loan debts of borrowers who spend a decade working in public service, including teaching, nursing and policing. According to the lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the plaintiffs fear that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, or anti-DEI policies, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers from loan forgiveness. They worry that a local nurse or first responder could be denied loan forgiveness because their local leaders defied the Trump administration. The complaint argues the rule is \"an attempt to target organizations and jurisdictions whose missions and policies do not align with [the Trump administration's] political positions on immigration, race, gender, free speech, and public protest.\" \"Politically motivated retaliation, like what the administration has done here, should have no place in America,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs. The plaintiff group also includes the National Council of Nonprofits, which  said in a statement  upon the rule's release: \"Nonprofits operate food banks, serve veterans, assist domestic violence survivors, deliver meals to seniors, respond to disasters, and much more. Nonprofits must be able to identify and meet those needs without political interference, fear of retribution, or exclusion from a program designed to support their employees.\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent denounced the lawsuit.  \"It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,\" Kent said in a statement to NPR. \"This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.\" In response to plaintiffs' concerns that the administration could use PSLF as a weapon to punish political opponents, Kent insisted \"the Department will enforce [the rule] neutrally, without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology, or the population they serve.\" The complaint says PSLF has allowed local governments to retain employees, including lawyers and engineers, who could earn more in the private sector. Albuquerque's leaders say that losing access to PSLF \"would likely create an untenable staffing crisis.\" In a statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu added: \"The City is joining with cities, unions, and nonprofits across the country to protect a program that helps Boston's workforce and millions of Americans in public service careers pay for college.\" What activities does the administration consider to be illegal?  One key question raised by this rule change, and the lawsuit, is: How will the Education Department define activities with \"substantial illegal purpose\"? According to the rule itself, such activities could include: \"aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws\" \"supporting terrorism or engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy\" \"engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of Federal or state law\" \"engaging in the trafficking of children to another State for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents in violation of Federal or State law\" \"engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination\" \"and engaging in a pattern of violating State laws.\" If the secretary determines that an employer has behaved with \"substantial illegal purpose,\" according to the rule, the employer can either engage with the department and accept a corrective action plan or risk losing access to PSLF for its employees for 10 years. In response to public comments, the Education Department  has said , \"[it] would have no basis to remove eligibility from nonprofits engaged in work related to immigrant communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice if those organizations are following the law.\" But the plaintiff cities, which sit on the U.S. Justice Department's  \"sanctuary jurisdictions\"  list, say the Trump administration has already accused them of impeding the enforcement of federal law, and that this rule \"represents yet another attack on politically disfavored local governments and nonprofits that have local laws, policies, and missions that are anathemas to the Administration.\" \"The actions of these cities are legal,\" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, another organization representing the plaintiffs. What's more, she says, \"whether or not these activities are legal, is not a [determination] that the secretary of education has either the right or the expertise to be making.\"   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new rule is the culmination of  a presidential action , issued in March, in which President Trump accused the Biden administration of abusing PSLF, and said the program \"has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.\" What did Congress intend when it created PSLF?  The plaintiffs argue Congress was clear about what should qualify as \"public service\" when it wrote the law, and that this new rule goes against lawmakers' intent. \"The Higher Education Act defines public service jobs as including government or a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization. It does not provide any discretion or wiggle room within that definition,\" Yu says. \"Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness. The secretary doesn't have the authority to change that.\" In response to public comments, the Education Department has  disagreed , writing that \"[it] rejects the suggestion that this rule exceeds its legal authority. The [Higher Education Act] grants the Secretary explicit power to regulate title IV programs. PSLF is a title IV program, and its proper administration requires clear, enforceable standards.\" Another lawsuit was filed in tandem Monday, by a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, arguing on behalf of Democratic-leaning state governments that worry their public employees could likewise be denied loan forgiveness because of state leaders' decisions to support immigrants, promote DEI or provide gender affirming care.  The coalition of attorneys general warned in a press release that the rule would result in \"widespread confusion, fear, and instability in the public workforce, forcing states to confront severe staffing shortages, higher turnover, and skyrocketing costs to maintain essential services.\"  According to federal data, more than 1.1 million public service workers have thus far had their federal student loan debts discharged under PSLF.  This story was updated to include comment from the U.S. Department of Education. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   More than a million Americans have had their student loan debts erased because they've worked in public service. Many teachers, nurses, government and nonprofit workers have stayed in their jobs in hopes of benefiting from the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Now, though, the Trump administration is changing the rules around who can qualify. Today, a host of cities and 21 states led by Democrats filed a pair of lawsuits saying they fear their public workers could soon be excluded. NPR's Cory Turner is here in the studio with more. Hey. CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So Cory, let's just start with a quick reminder of the PSLF program. How is it supposed to work? TURNER: Yeah, it was created by Congress in 2007, signed by then-President George W. Bush. And the law offers what is essentially a quid pro quo to federal student loan borrowers. If you work for 10 years in public service, the government agrees to erase whatever is left of your student loan debts. The idea was to help nonprofits and state and local governments hire and retain good people even if they can't pay private sector wages. And Congress, we should say, defined public service really broadly in the law to include anyone working in government or a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. SUMMERS: Right, OK. So help me understand, then, how does the Trump administration hope to change this program? TURNER: Yeah, they released a final rule change last week that will go into effect in July, and it allows the education secretary to deny loan forgiveness if employers engage in activities with, quote, \"substantial illegal purpose,\" Juana. SUMMERS: OK. TURNER: There, the department includes, quote, \"aiding and abetting violations of federal immigration laws,\" also engaging in, quote, \"the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of federal or state law.\" The concern among these states and cities with this lawsuit is that by being what the Justice Department has called sanctuary jurisdictions, for example, or by following state or local laws that promote diversity or protect the rights of transgender people, the secretary of education could say to them, look, I think your leaders are acting with illegal purpose, and then bar any of that state or local government's employees from getting loan forgiveness. These suits accuse the administration, essentially, of trying to weaponize PSLF and they argue the secretary doesn't have the authority, let alone the expertise, to decide what is illegal purpose or to add restrictions that Congress never intended in the law. SUMMERS: Cory, what's the Trump administration had to say about those accusations? TURNER: Yeah, in a statement today from the undersecretary of education, Nicholas Kent, he called it - opposition to the rule unconscionable. Kent also said, quote, \"this is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm.\" He also insisted the rule would be enforced, quote, \"without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology or the population they serve.\" One last thing, Juana. Employers at risk of failing this new standard will have two options. They can risk being excluded from loan forgiveness for 10 years or they can change their policies as part of a corrective action plan. SUMMERS: NPR education correspondent Cory Turner, thank you. TURNER: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5576353","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Dalai Lama created a Tibetan capital in exile in India.

It's shrinking \n         By Diaa Hadid, Omkar Khandekar \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         DHARAMSHALA, India — Boys and girls harmonize together as their music teacher Tenzin Nordel leads them through a Tibetan song in a classroom overlooking an alpine forest. Theater kids practice Tibetan operas in the school hall. Even as they shoot hoops, teenage boys wear traditional shirts that button to one side, under the shoulder. For decades, this is how the  Tibetan Children's Village  imparted Tibetan students with their language, culture and faith in their de facto capital in exile in the northern Indian city  of Dharamshala. Except now, the number of children attending the school is shrinking, echoing the fate of the exile community itself. \"It's like taking water out of a bucket,\" says Bhuchung Sonam, a Tibetan poet and publisher, describing the city. \"You take one jug or two jugs, that much, the bucket becomes that much empty, right?\" The Dalai Lama and his sisters set up Tibetan Children's Village in Dharamshala in 1960, after they fled Chinese-ruled Tibet following a  failed uprising . It  expanded as thousands of people followed their spiritual leader into exile. They enrolled their kids in the school so they'd be raised as Tibetans. The émigrés included parents who only found work in remote, hostile areas like isolated Himalayan villages, carving roads out of steep mountain slopes.  \"It was difficult to keep their small kids with them. So they were sent to Dharamshala,\" says Penpa Tsering, leader of the Central Tibetan Administration, a  government-in-exile  in Dharamshala. Tibetan parents, fathers mostly, also snuck into India to leave their children at the school. They include the 52-year-old poet Sonam, who was about 10 when his father left him in Dharamshala. He estimates that from 1980 to 2008, \"something like 23,000 children came out of Tibet,\" where he says they formed a fifth of all exiles. Educator Tindup Galpo was among them. \"When I was just 7 or 8 years old, in 1984, I crossed the Himalayas,\" Galpo says. All he remembers of the journey is that he and his father \"walked, and then he took me on his shoulder,\" he says. \"From that day till now, almost 40 years, I never met my father.\" Galpo, who guesses he is about 40 years old, was raised by his teachers, who also supervised the boarding houses. He says he didn't feel abandoned or lonely because there were \"thousands\" of other kids just like him. They were like \"brothers and sisters,\" he says. \"This is my home, really, this is my home.\" After Galpo graduated from college, he began working as a teacher at the Children's Village. \"After class, I'm a father of 32 children,\" he says, grinning. He and his wife, who was also raised in the village, take care of the children once their school day is over, helping with their reading and putting them to bed. The school has the capacity to serve 8,642 children across its seven Indian branches, but only 4,682 children are enrolled, according to senior administrator Kalsang Phuntsok.  For years, the village has been consolidating and shuttering classrooms. \"Everything is changing,\" Galpo says. The Tibetan Children's Village \"is shrinking.\" Even in Dharamshala, the largest branch of the Tibetan Children's Village is winding down. Tenzin Choekyi, the branch's principal, says there aren't many younger children entering the system. Compare the first grade class, with only 12 students, to grade 3, with 61 students, she says. That's partly because Tibetans are having fewer children. \"Unlike our older generations,\" Choekyi says with a laugh, referring to her parents who had five children, \"I have only two.\" Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration tells NPR that the exiled population appeared to peak around 2010, with just over 100,000 Tibetan exiles  living throughout  India. Now, he estimates, there are around 70,000 in India, with another 60,000 Tibetans living across Europe, North America and Australia. Only a trickle of Tibetans have been able to reach India since China hardened its borders in 2008, following an uprising in Chinese-ruled Tibet ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics. \"That security apparatus never really got rolled back up once the games were over,\" says Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. And \"the border has been much more heavily patrolled.\" Before 2008, she says, \"there were at least a couple of hundred people coming out over the border every year, and I think we're down into the single digits now.\" One Tibetan who managed to reach Dharamshala is 27-year-old Namkyi, who only has one name.  When she was just a teenager, Namkyi says she was sent to a prison work camp in Tibet for three years as punishment for brandishing a picture of the Dalai Lama. She had been plotting her escape from China ever since. It took her nine years to find the right people to smuggle her out, she says, and she finally made it in the spring of 2023. But living in Dharamshala sometimes saddens her, she says. \"Everyone is going abroad, there are no children here.\" They're migrating to the West. \"These social and demographic changes are a huge challenge for us,\" says Tsering, explaining that Dharamshala was built as a \"compact community, where all Tibetans live together.\" That has allowed Tibetans \"to preserve our identity through our schools, monastic institutions, cultural institutions.\" In the Tibetan Children's Village, some of the children are looking for the exits. Like 15-year-old Gawa, who met NPR reporters at the school library on a recent day, as the sound of children practicing an opera filtered through. Gawa said he spent most days between Buddhist worship, basketball and school. He wanted to be a poet — except he figured that studying medicine would provide him with a more stable future. So he's trying to get a scholarship to a university in the United Kingdom. \"I want to pursue my future abroad, where there are more opportunities, more facilities, more everything,\" Gawa said. Gawa said he saw India as a place he'd return to for holidays — something he says his traditional Tibetan parents supported: His mother is a teacher at the school and his father works in a Buddhist monastery. The slow unraveling of the Tibetan capital in exile comes at a precarious time. The Dalai Lama  turned 90  in July. He says his successor — or reincarnate — will be born outside of China, but the Chinese government  insists only it  has the authority to select the next Dalai Lama. \"We are definitely concerned,\" says  Lobsang Sangay , the former head of the Tibetan government in exile. He says historically, the period between the passing of the old Dalai Lama and the enthronement of the new is \"our most volatile, sensitive, delicate period.\" Sangay  says Tibetans were heartened when President Trump, during his first administration, signed a law that  sanctions  Chinese officials who interfere in Tibetan religious matters. \"The Secretary of State Rubio was a co-sponsor of the bill,\" he says of Marco Rubio, who was a Florida senator at the time. \"Now he's in a position to implement it.\" But in Trump's second administration, Rubio halted some $12 million of aid earmarked for Tibetan exiles as a part of broader cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the Central Tibetan Administration. Asked about the funds, the State Department told NPR it has resumed distribution of just over half the aid and continues to call on China to cease its interference in the Dalai Lama's succession. Amid concerns about the future of the Tibetan movement for autonomy, Sangay says Tibetans have clung to a simple truth: \"Our job is simple: We have to survive. As long as we survive, we will have our opportunities.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597013","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:22:00-05:00","title":"A gun violence 'action plan' calls for a new emphasis on prevention","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A comprehensive action plan developed by 60 experts from diverse fields—including medicine, public health, law, and technology—has been published in JAMA, proposing a multi-pronged strategy to reduce gun violence in the U.S. by 2040.

A new report offers a roadmap to reduce the human toll of this crisis by 2040. Sixty leading experts from a range of fields, including medicine, public health, criminology, law and the technology sector, convened earlier this year to create an action plan to address the problem. The report was  published in  JAMA  on Monday . \"For too long, I think we've treated this as inevitable,\" says  Dr. Joseph Sakran , a co-author of the study, trauma surgeon and executive vice chair of surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gun violence is now the leading cause of death in  children and teens , although the vast majority of firearm deaths are among adults. And nearly 60% of all deaths from firearm injuries are suicides. \"We do have a body of science that can inform and reduce the burden of injuries from firearm violence,\" says  Dr. Sandro Galea , dean of the school of public health at Washington University in St Louis, and study co-author. \"For example, through laws that make sure that there is appropriate screening, that guns do not fall in the hands of people who have a history of violence.\" The authors support alternatives to the typical approach to addressing firearm violence, which has been through the criminal justice system. \"We are not saying we don't need any arrest or any incarceration,\" says study co-author  Daniel Webster , a professor at the  Center for Gun Violence Solutions  at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"That's still necessary for public safety purposes. But you need to invest in programs that prevent violence.\" The roadmap outlined by the study includes taking a community-wide approach to prevention by addressing socioeconomic inequalities. \"Firearm harm is a symptom of deeper structural issues when you think about poverty and segregation and trauma and lack of opportunity,\" says Sakran, who is himself a survivor of gun violence. When he was 17 years old, he was critically injured at a shooting after a high school football game. Studies show that addressing those \"upstream\" factors can prevent gun violence, says Sakran. \"Things like housing stability, having a strong educational system, a pathway for jobs, access to health care, which are as essential to violence prevention as maybe perhaps any other law enforcement strategy,\" he adds. One such community violence intervention in Chicago, called  Create Real Economic Destiny , uses community organizations to identify the individuals most at risk of being involved in violent crime and recruit them to receive supports such as mental health care, mentorship, education and job training. A 2023 study found  that alumni of this program had a 73% lower chance of being involved in a violent crime in the following two years. Webster and his colleagues have found that a similar program in Baltimore, called  Safe Streets , led to a 32% reduction in homicides and a 23% reduction in non-fatal shootings. State gun laws also make a difference, says Webster. For example,  a recent study in  JAMA Pediatrics   showed that states with more restrictive gun laws have fewer pediatric deaths from firearms. Webster and his colleagues have shown that firearm licensing laws \"can reduce firearm homicide roughly 30% or possibly more. \"And similar effects on reducing firearm suicide,\" he says. Overall, the report calls for a multi-pronged approach to prevention. \"In America, the burden [of addressing gun violence] has often been placed on the shoulders of a few people,\" says Sakran. \"What this report is talking about is the collective action that is so critical in order to move the needle forward.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587728","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"How one tech startup is giving cash to SNAP recipients","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing food insecurity crisis is unfolding as nearly 42 million Americans relying on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) face delayed and underfunded payments due to a government freeze and funding shortfall.

\n         By Maria Aspan \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Propel CEO Jimmy Chen knows how it feels to go hungry. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When he was growing up in Kansas City, his parents sometimes struggled to put food on the table. Today, his Brooklyn tech company makes a free app for people on the federal government's anti-hunger  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP . About 5 million people use Propel's app to check their SNAP balances, and get coupons and discounts on groceries. That gives Chen a pretty good view into how they're being affected by the federal government's unprecedented delay in sending out November payments. \"Their budgets are already extremely tight. There's usually not a lot of wiggle room,\" Chen says. \"So a delay of even a few days on an expected deposit ends up being a really, really huge deal.\" Now his company is trying to bridge that gap ,  joining other  private businesses ,  nonprofits , and  individuals  scrambling to offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. On Saturday, Propel started giving payments of $50 to people using its app, prioritizing those with children and little or no income. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We understand that $50 is not enough,\" Chen says, adding that Propel is trying to reach the largest number of families and \"provide an amount that gives them a little bit of breathing room.\" The company has identified about 230,000 users who fit this \"high need\" profile. It has donated $1 million of the total $10 million it needs to fund $50 payments to most of them, and is hoping to beat that target. Looking for partners Propel has also lined up some donations from its corporate partners, including the New York anti-poverty nonprofit Robin Hood and ecommerce platform Babylist. It also set up a crowdfunding campaign with the nonprofit  GiveDirectly , which  runs similar programs  all  over the world  and which  has worked with Propel  in the past. GiveDirectly says it's raised a total of $6 million, including Propel's contributions, so far. \"The sheer scale and volume of this need is so immense. We're talking about millions of low income Americans who are at risk of not getting this assistance,\" says Sarina Jain, GiveDirectly's senior program manager focused on U.S. disaster responses. Even as they've scrambled to launch this donation program, Chen and Jain acknowledge that all of the efforts from non-profits and private companies can never replace the federal government, which spends  $8 billion every month  on the country's largest anti-hunger program. \"At the end of the day, the single biggest thing we can do in this country is to get SNAP back online, depositing on a predictable schedule to the people who receive it,\" Chen says. 42 million SNAP recipients face delayed payments  Almost 42 million people rely on SNAP. Now they're waiting for payments that the government stopped making on Saturday — and they're facing delays that could stretch into months. After  two federal judges ruled  that freezing SNAP payments is unlawful, the Trump administration on Monday  said it would restart  partial SNAP payments. But the government added that states would only receive about half the amount of federal funding they usually get. It plans to use money from an Agriculture Department contingency fund, which contains only $5 billion — well short of the $8 billion it costs to provide full SNAP benefits each month. The government also warned that it could take some states \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" to process the reduced payments. That could be disastrous for many SNAP recipients, such as Shenita Melton. The 37-year-old lives in rural Anson County, North Carolina, and relies on SNAP to help feed her four children. Propel connected NPR to Melton, who said last week that she was already starting to scramble to find enough food for her kids — especially her three teenagers, who \"eat a lot.\" There aren't many food banks in the rural area where she lives. The few that do exist only allow people to pick up groceries once or twice a month. Melton also says that many of the groceries at those food banks are expired. \"I'm kind of scared to give my kids expired food,\" she says. \"But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5332144","dateOfPublication":"2025-03-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Still cringing about that awkward moment?

They were planned years ago \n         By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to U.S. cities have outraged his political rivals, tested legal precedents and led to nationwide protests. The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a  move that would stray significantly  from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation. Trump has sent troops into  four Democratic-led cities  and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have  regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration  into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city,  only to back track his comments  and focus on a different city days later. But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller,   a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's  right hand man on immigration  — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the  Insurrection Act , which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations. Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots. Laying the groundwork Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the  largest deportation operation  in American history. In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but  struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower  needed to carry out the goal. In a  TIME Magazine interview  in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military. \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded. Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before. In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist  Charlie Kirk's podcast  to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\" Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state. The deployments In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies. Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition. \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator. Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors. \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says. It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017,  The Associated Press reported  on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan. Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that. \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says. Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts. NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\" Project 2025 The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in  Project 2025 , a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long. Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them. \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says. The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic  who also wrote a book on the project . So is the use of the military. \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\" Beyond mass deportation In recent weeks, Trump has talked about  invoking the Insurrection Act often , especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about. He  told the New York Times  back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\" That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large. Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots. \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5501530","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"14:53:00Z","title":"Why does my toddler … ?

Your kiddo's most confounding behavior, decoded \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 2:53 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Parenting a two year old is such a wild ride. The other day, my son started the morning with an explosion of cuddles, followed immediately by refusing the blueberry muffins he had declared his  very favorite  the week before. Once we made it through breakfast, the daily Battle of Putting on Shoes was still ahead! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sometimes, I feel like I'm playing a game of emotional ping pong with my kid. And that can be hard for both me and him to manage. Fast-changing feelings and defiant behavior are developmentally appropriate for one to three year olds, says pediatric psychologist  Roger Harrison . They're a way of building your kid's sense of self — and understanding their place in the world. But for parents, they can often be a source of frustration, he says. When tantrums and power struggles arise from those emotions, it can be easy for us adults to lose our patience.  Reframing your toddler's boundary-pushing as a means of social and emotional learning might offer some relief, says Harrison, a division chief within the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"When we understand the 'why' of certain behaviors and place them within an appropriate developmental context, it allows parents to step back from the emotion and address the behavior strategically,\" he says. Harrison and other child development experts answer questions about common toddler behaviors — and offer advice on how to respond in the situation. Why does my toddler … say \"NO!\" to   everything, even to things they like?  A toddler's contrarian nature is just par for the course at this stage of development, says Harrison. In addition to developing more language and cognitive and motor skills at lightning speed, they're just beginning to understand that they are their own unique person separate from their caregivers. With this new awareness comes a need to test boundaries in order to establish independence. \"Part of that process of  figuring out who I am is to learn  me  in opposition to all the things in the world,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler gives you a resounding \"NO!\" to his favorite popsicle or book before bedtime, what he might be actually doing is trying to flex his newly discovered self-awareness. His \"no\" could translate to, \"Check this out, Mommy! I'm a person with my own mind and opinions now!\" ⭐  Parent tip:   What should you do if you need your child to say \"yes\" to, say, brushing their teeth, getting in their car seat or leaving the playground? Model a calm response, then kindly but firmly let them know what's going to happen next, says  Jamie Glowacki , a parenting and potty training coach and the   author of  Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler . You might say:  Yes, we do need to leave the playground. You can either go down the slide one more time and walk out with me, or I can carry you out right now.   Why does my toddler … say everything is \"mine\"? In Toddlerland, \"the rules of ownership are different,\" Harrison says. \"If it's mine, it's  mine . If it's yours and  I  want it, it's also mine.\" As a child starts to build their identity and independence, they'll often try to exert control over their environment through possession, Harrison says. It helps them understand themselves and their attachments in the world. For example: my mom has black hair, so I have black hair. My sister has a cool toy, so I have a cool toy.  I am a kid with black hair and a cool toy! Mine, mine, mine!   By making claims like these, a toddler can test the boundaries of their environment to better define who they are. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler claims every book in the library is hers or refuses to share even her  least  favorite stuffie on her playdate — don't stress, says Harrison. She's not being selfish, she's just stretching out that newfound sense of self.  ⭐  Parent tip:  If you want your kid to share, model then practice the behavior, says early childhood educator  Chazz Lewis . For example, in the aftermath of a toy dispute with another child on the playground, teach your toddler to ask for a turn by reaching your palm out assertively and saying, \"turn, please,\" he says. Do a few practice rounds before sending them back out to play.  Why does my toddler … want to lick/smash/crash into everything? Does your little one love to spill every container they can get their hands on, lick colorful wallpaper or bounce against your living room like it's a life-size pinball machine? They may simply be trying to gain some sensory information about their surroundings, says  Layne Deyling Cherland , a longtime preschool teacher-turned-content creator who focuses on adult-toddler dynamics. To them, every action and interaction is a chance to gather more data about themselves and how things work. \"What's me and what's not me? What effect do I have on the world? That's what all this experimenting is,\" says Deyling Cherland. They may also be craving proprioceptive input, like the deep pressure gained from tight hugs or the strength-building from climbing on playground equipment, she says.  Toddlers crave these types of sensory experiences in part because it builds up their internal sense of position and movement, which is important for coordination, balance and even self-regulation. ⭐  Parent tip :   As long as she's safe, let your little one explore, says Deyling Cherland. Embracing weirdness or silliness can be an opportunity for connection and a key to disrupting power struggles.  Make an obstacle course with pillows and stuffies to get those zoomies out, then race through it together. Dole out some new or favorite snacks into separate bowls and have your picky eater play a game of blind taste-testing. Why does my toddler … keep doing that thing I told them not to do 100 times? No running in the kitchen! I said, don't run in the kitchen! You have 10 seconds to stop running in the kitchen or you're in big trouble, missy!  If you're repeating yourself a bunch with your toddler, you've likely already lost control of the situation, says Glowacki. From a comprehension standpoint, your average toddler doesn't yet grasp the concept of negation, Lewis says. So when you say  don't  run in the kitchen, what your child is more likely to understand from that sentence is:  run  in the kitchen. More importantly, simply telling a kid what you  don't  want them to do doesn't give them any tools for how to behave successfully in the future, he says. ⭐  Parent tip:  Instead of telling your toddler what they're doing  wrong , teach them how to solve the problem or what they should do instead, says Lewis. If you want your kid to stop running in the kitchen, you might say, \"walk slowly in the kitchen.\" Or maybe, \"please walk slowly and gently on the tile floor so you don't hurt yourself.\" \"Now, there's a chance they might actually do something different this time,\" Lewis says. Why does my toddler … hate switching activities? Wake up! Change clothes! Eat breakfast!   Toddlers are bossed around all day long, often with little understanding and even less say in their daily schedule. While toddlers thrive on routine and consistency, transitioning from one task to another can be frustrating, Glowacki says. The break in continuity can be unsettling, especially when they're immersed in an activity that gives them a sense of comfort and independence, like playtime or bath time. Those moments are also one of the very few pieces of the world she can exert any agency over, so that loss of control can feel acute. Add to that hunger, sleepiness, overstimulation — daily factors that would stress out any other human — and those transition periods can become triggers for volatile emotions and tantrums, she says. ⭐  Parent tip:    The next time your little one throws a fit about transitioning from playtime to dinnertime, try to remember that the change is huge for her, says Glowacki. Put a little power back into her hands by offering two positive choices, Lewis says. For example: Blue plate or purple plate? Juice or milk? This gives her agency but allows you to safely steer her where she needs to go.  \"The goal of toddlerhood is to give a child manageable pieces of personal power to practice with,\" Deyling Cherland says. \"We want them to have practiced enough so that when they are this young adult going out into the world, they know, 'This is how I make decisions. My decisions do affect other people.' \" The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Who should you respond to first? How do you deal with a group chat that keeps popping off? What happens if you accidentally leave someone on read? These texting situations can be tricky, but managing them is a lot more straightforward than you might think, says Nick Leighton, host of the etiquette and manners podcast  Were You Raised by Wolves? . \"A lot of people forget that texting is just another form of communication,\" he says. \"But the principles of 'let's not waste people's time' and 'let's be mindful of their feelings' have never changed.\" Leighton and Erica Dhawan, author of  Digital Body Language: How to Build Trust and Connection, No Matter the Distance , explain how to apply the basic rules of etiquette to everyday texting — and they offer advice on five common texting conundrums. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I feel inundated by the volume of texts I receive in a day, so sometimes I don't respond to messages right away. Does that make me a bad texter?  \"We need to get over our reaction that everyone needs to respond immediately,\" says Dhawan, who wrote the popular  New York Times  essay \" Ignoring a text message or email isn't always rude. Sometimes it's necessary \" in 2022. The person on the receiving end could be \"with a screaming toddler, on the toilet, on a Zoom call.\" Dhawan says when we receive texts, we're kind of like emergency room doctors \"triaging on multiple levels\" to figure out what needs action first. Texts from, say, a day care teacher telling you that your child is sick, or a colleague saying a meeting is canceled, require an urgent response. Others, like a funny video or a party invitation with an RSVP deadline a month from now, not so much. So think about which messages could wait a day or two, or even a week. In turn, \"don't feel ghosted if someone doesn't respond immediately to you,\" she says. My sister texts me a lot of social media videos, like maybe five a day. I know this is her way of showing love, but I don't have time to watch them all. How should I handle this situation?  You don't need to watch or reply to every video in real time, Dhawan says. You might save all the videos to watch at the end of the day or week and send a reply then. And if you don't end up watching them, that's OK too. A simple \"love these,\" which acknowledges you received the videos, will suffice. \"This is your sister's texting love language, so remember what matters here.\" If you and your sister are close, you might tell her in a phone call, \"I love the videos, but it's a little overwhelming to get so many in the day,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I forgot to respond to a friend's text about getting lunch together about a month ago. And now I need to ask a huge favor from this person. What should I do?  \"We can't just go right into the ask,\" says Leighton. \"That's a little provocative.\" Instead, try something light and breezy like, \"Oh my goodness, I just realized I totally spaced out. I'd love to grab lunch with you. Let me know when you're free,\" he says. Then, you can send a follow-up text with your big ask. \"You're gonna have to set up that lunch though.\" How do I get someone who's unresponsive on text to message me back? I'm trying to plan a group outing to a concert, and it's time to buy the tickets.  Be direct, Dhawan says. \"When it comes to a decision text, we have to actually ask a specific question, like, 'Here are the tickets. I'm gonna buy them on Tuesday. Let me know today if you want me to buy you one.'\" Make sure it's clear that your message is asking a question and that a response is needed by a certain time. \"If they don't respond, let it go and move on,\" Dhawan says. My group chat is a mess. I have to scroll so far up to understand what the heck is going on. There are side conversations and random emojis and memes. How do I set some ground rules?  \"Etiquette is often about deciding which hill you want to die on,\" says Leighton. If there's a behavior in the group chat that is truly maddening, \"have a polite yet direct conversation.\" That said, there is such a thing as text etiquette in group chats, Dhawan says. Don't send unnecessary text messages, she says. \"Think before you ping. Take an extra breath and ask, 'Is this relevant?'\" Instead of sending a text message that says, \"ha ha ha,\" could you just double-tap and click the \"ha ha\" emoji, saving members of the group a notification? If you want to call someone out, do it privately on a separate text, Dhawan says. \"Take your drama to your one-on-one DMs. Remember that personal squabbles don't belong in the group.\" Don't forget to use your phone's messaging features to your benefit, she says. Mute chats to reduce notifications. Archive or exit chats to keep your threads tidy. Being in multiple group chats is like being in \"five different coffee chats at the exact same time. It can be overwhelming.\" The podcast episode was produced by Clare Marie Schneider. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Traditions such as the kanto festival reinforce gender segregation, with men allowed to touch bamboo poles due to Shinto beliefs about impurity, while women are confined to musical roles. A 2025 government report reveals that 27% of young women want to leave their hometowns, compared to 15% of men, due to limited job opportunities, lack of promotion, and expectations to prioritize marriage and childbearing. Experts like sociologist Masahiro Yamada and activists like Ren Yamamoto highlight systemic gender discrimination and the absence of policies that support women’s autonomy.

Many rural women report a vague sense of unease known as 'moya moya', signaling deep-seated frustration.

prompting women to leave rural Japan \n         By Anthony Kuhn \n        \n           Monday, November 3, 2025 • 5:03 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series  Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World  explores the causes and implications of this trend. AKITA, Japan — Young men in traditional festival clothes balance heavy bamboo poles up to 40 feet high on their heads, hands, hips and shoulders. Crossbars on the poles carry dozens of candlelit paper lanterns. Part ritual, part festival and part competition,   kanto  is a centuries-old display of strength, skill and culture unique to Akita Prefecture, in northern Japan's Tohoku region. Traditionally, only men are allowed to touch the poles. Women play flutes and drums. Kanto practitioners believe that women cannot participate because, according to Japan's Shinto religion, women's blood from menstruation and childbirth is considered impure for the purpose of religious rituals. Some Japanese women accept Kanto's gender divisions as part of the culture, or simply refrain from criticizing them. College student Mayaka Ogawa, for example, says, \"We can't really argue against tradition and religious reasons.\" Kanto is emblematic of both Akita's cultural splendor and its conservative rural society. And Akita itself is emblematic of Japan's 21st century demographic challenges: It has the most aged   population  (39% were over age 65 in 2024), the lowest birth rate and the fastest declining population of Japan's 47 prefectures, according to government figures. Gender inequality is accelerating depopulation in rural areas like this. Rural women flee gender inequality A Japanese government  report  on inequality published in June found that 27% of young women want to leave their hometowns, compared to 15% of young men — and rigid gender roles in rural society are prompting young women to vote with their feet. The survey shows that most women move to the cities in search of better employment opportunities — but there's a gender angle to that, too. Widespread expectations that women will prioritize housework and childcare also diminish young women's educational prospects, motivating them to leave rural areas.  In rural communities, \"women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo,\" says Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada. The problem is persistent, he says, because \"middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women.\" While last month's selection of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister breaks an important glass ceiling, she advocates a conservative, traditional view of gender roles. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the  World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report  for 2025. A   study  last year found that 744 Japanese municipalities, or 43% of the total, mostly in rural areas, are at risk of disappearing because their proportion of women of childbearing age are expected to drop by half by mid-century. But the effects of depopulation in Japan are already impossible to miss. Hundreds of thousands of jobs go unfilled due to  labor shortages . Millions of homes stand  vacant  or abandoned. Making women's voices heard While the exodus of rural women continues, some women stay put or return to rural areas to try to improve them. Ren Yamamoto  wanted to make young rural women's voices heard. So the 26-year-old resident of Nirasaki, a city in Yamanashi Prefecture — home to Mount Fuji and some 80 miles west of Tokyo — taped 100 interviews with rural women and started her own YouTube  channel . Many of her interviewees told her \"when they go back to their hometowns, they're asked: 'when are you getting married? when are you going to have children?' and they're sick of being forced into such a role,\" she says. Japan's public broadcaster NHK  reported  on her project. Earlier this year, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to  meet  with him. \"Policies to support women have been centered on childcare and marriage, without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas,\" Yamamoto told Ishiba. \"Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines.\" Ishiba told Yamamoto he was trying to improve the situation, but it was tough because local officials are overwhelmingly middle-aged men. The government searches for policy fixes Japan's government has pointed out that the issues of gender equality and falling birthrate are inseparably linked. Central and local authorities are trying various  policies  to address both issues. Some local governments, including  Tokyo's  and Akita's, serve as matchmakers to try to increase marriages and births. \"I hate that,\" exclaims Mayaka Ogawa, the Akita college student. \"It almost comes across as women can't do it for themselves.\" She adds: \"Women are starting to awaken to the fact that they don't really need to form a family in order to be fulfilled.\" On a recent weekend, a handful of mostly middle-aged women attended a lecture in Akita, where an \"assertiveness trainer\" coached them on how to convince husbands to help more with housework and childcare. A poster for the event shows drawings of smiling men ironing laundry and cradling children. \"Even though so many people across Japan are putting in so much effort [toward gender equality], we still find ourselves in a situation where progress is painfully slow,\" says Naoko Tani, director of the Akita Prefectural Central Gender Equality Center, which hosted the lecture. Gnawing unease and pessimism Some Akita women say they suffer from  moya moya , a vague, gnawing sense that things aren't right, but they can't put their finger on it. Taboos against challenging gender roles and male authority thicken the fog of  moya moya . Tani says she too once suffered from this confusion, but \"through learning about things from a gender perspective, there were moments when things suddenly clicked for me — when I thought, 'Ah, so this is what it's about.' And at those times, the realization moved me to tears.\" Others are just moved to leave and not look back. \"Akita is often called an isolated island on land,\" says high school student Yukina Oguma, whose family are hereditary managers of a Buddhist temple in Akita. She plans to go to college in another prefecture. Asked what she would do if she were told or expected to stay in Akita and take over the temple, she replies, \"I would run away.\" Some women are pessimistic about improving gender equality in Akita anytime soon. \"Let Akita be depopulated. There is no way of stopping it, honestly speaking,\" argues college student Miwa Sawano. \"They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave.\" Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report in Tokyo and Yamanashi and Akita Prefectures. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Japan has more elderly adults than any major nation, and it is losing nearly a million people a year. By mid-century, an estimated 750 towns and villages may vanish from the map. One of the surest indicators of a village's slide toward extinction is when young women start leaving. NPR's Anthony Kuhn explains. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Crowds cheer as young men balance bamboo poles up to 40-feet high with lanterns on their hands, heads, hips and shoulders. It's a centuries-old tradition unique to Japan's Akita Prefecture. Only men are allowed to touch the poles and be sashite, or pole carriers. The women play flutes and drums. One pole carrier is New Zealand college student, Raz Tripp (ph). He says Kanto is rooted in Japan's Shinto religion. RAZ TRIPP: The reason only men can be sashite is because the goddess resides in the pole, and she doesn't like being touched by women. She gets jealous. KUHN: Miwa Sawano (ph) is a college senior and former Kanto club member. She accepts Kanto's gender roles as part of Akita's traditional culture, but she objects to the club's drinking parties with local residents. MIWA SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Things like sexual harassment happen. Kanto performers wear shorts, and girls' legs get touched a lot by the local men. KUHN: Akita has the most aged population, the lowest birth rate and the fastest rate of population decline of Japan's 47 prefectures. A government report in June said that many women are leaving rural areas due to rigid gender roles there. Even more leave for better jobs, but Chuo University sociologist Masahiro Yamada says there's a gender angle to that too. MASAHIRO YAMADA: (Through interpreter) Middle-aged and older men in rural areas don't want to change the current situation of discrimination against women, where women are stuck in temporary or part-time jobs and only men get promoted. Women don't want to work in these places, so they move to Tokyo. KUHN: But some women stay in or return to their hometowns to try to improve them. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) KUHN: I met one such person in Nirasaki, a small city of about 28,000 people, some 80 miles west of Tokyo in Yamanashi Prefecture. So it's about 1 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon, and this is the main street of Nirasaki. And there's a fair amount of traffic, but most of the storefronts and shops here are shuttered. Twenty-six-year-old Ren Yamamoto (ph) wanted to make young, rural women's voices heard. She taped a hundred interviews and posted them on YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Japanese). REN YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Lots of them said that when they go back to their hometowns, they feel pressure because they're asked, when are you getting married? When are you going to have children? And they're sick of being forced into such a role. KUHN: Yamamoto put the issue of gender inequality and depopulation on the map. Public broadcaster NHK reported on her project. Later, then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba invited her to meet with him. Yamamoto told Ishiba that government policies are missing the mark. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YAMAMOTO: (Through interpreter) Policies to support women have been centered on child care and marriage without addressing the reasons why women leave rural areas. Policymakers haven't faced the fact that women have their own choices to make. We feel like we're seen as baby-making machines. KUHN: Japanese women's political empowerment ranks 125th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report for 2025. (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMS AND FLUTE PLAYING) KUHN: Back in Akita, kids try drumming as the Kanto performance wraps up. Many women are pessimistic about changing Akita's conservative traditional culture. Independent Akita journalist Miwako Miura (ph) says her local newspaper boss told her not to report on gender inequality. MIWAKO MIURA: (Through interpreter) The deeper you go into rural areas, the more people try to not talk about gender issues. People are afraid that if they say something that crosses the line, they'll be criticized. It's a taboo. KUHN: Some rural women complain of what they call in Japanese moyamoya (ph). It's a vague feeling that something is wrong, but you can't quite put your finger on it. Often, it's enough to make women leave the countryside. College senior Miwa Sawano says let them go. SAWANO: (Through interpreter) Let Akita be depopulated. There's no way of stopping it, honestly speaking. They won't realize they have a problem until the women leave.

How do you save money on groceries? We posed this question to our audience after  we published an episode on the topic  with Beth Moncel, founder of the cooking blog  Budget Bytes . She advised shoppers to  look up weekly deals ,  be wary of bulk buying  and stick to the grocery list.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We received over 50 more money-saving tips from our listeners, ranging from the practical (check your receipt for errors) to the creative (use artificial intelligence to create recipes with ingredients you already have at home).  Here's a selection of their responses. They have been edited for length and clarity. For more tips, listen to the podcast episode in the player above.  Stay close to home If you must visit multiple stores, make sure they are close to your home or else the gas expense will eat away at the money saved at the store. —  Manuel Ramos Check your receipt Check the receipt before you leave the parking lot. If you find an error, which mostly happens on sale items, you can get a refund right away. If you don't check until you get home, you're more likely to let it go. — Lisa Gluskin Ask about senior discounts I'm a senior, so I try to shop on senior discount days and save 5%. The stores don't advertise this, but if you Google it or ask about it at the customer service desk, you can find out what day of the week they do this.  It varies by store . — Elyce O'Malley Cook with whole turkey and chicken  When I buy meat, I buy whole turkey and chicken. Both are cheaper by the pound, and the latter is so easy to make in a slow or pressure cooker. I'll also buy special meats after the holidays. You can buy spiral hams and whole turkeys for cheap after Easter and Thanksgiving. — Vanessa Reed \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Buy inexpensive cuts of meat If your dish is going to cook for a long time, the exact cut of beef may be unimportant. So I use the least expensive roast in the store. At the usual one-hour cooking time, it may be a little tough, but add an extra 40 minutes and it will turn out great. — Joseph Bean Process your own food  Pop your own corn. Roast chickpeas by buying them dry, soaking them overnight and putting them into a low-temperature oven. Buy large containers of plain yogurt, divide them up and add spices, a little jam or other flavors. — Eve Elzenga Get a little help from AI I recently started using ChatGPT to help use up food in the kitchen. For example, this weekend, I had a tomato, some bell peppers, half an onion, a half dozen sweet potatoes, broccoli and leftover roasted chicken in the fridge.  I told ChatGPT I wanted to make something for breakfast and dinner using these ingredients. The tomato, peppers and onion went into egg cups — breakfast for the week — and the potatoes, broccoli and chicken became twice-baked stuffed sweet potatoes for dinner. Both were delicious, and I'll enjoy them this coming week too! — Chris Brainard Make your own bread Learn how to make bread. This saves a ton of money, and you can occasionally supplement with store-bought bread if needed. About $8 worth of ingredients makes about eight to ten loaves of basic sandwich-style bread. It doesn't have preservatives, so freeze what you can't use in a week. — Tracey Rocco Flip the script (and cook creatively)  Instead of planning a meal and then buying overpriced ingredients, try flipping the script. Buy what's on sale and plan your meal around that.  In addition, have a few meal options for each type of protein that include a variety of flavors and different cooking methods. For example, you probably wouldn't want to eat deep-fried food three days in a row. If spareribs are on sale, I'll buy them and make either deep-fried salt and pepper spareribs, braised Filipino adobo, grilled hoisin spareribs or Japanese curry. If ground beef is on sale, I'll make fried smash burgers or Japanese hamburger steak. — Mark Hagiwara  Grow your own herbs and veggies  Grow higher-priced items that you buy frequently, like rosemary and basil. Fresh herbs are often $2 to $3 for a small bunch — about the same price as a packet of seeds. Or save a few sprigs from that bunch of herbs and root them in water then plant them. I have a basil plant in a pot that I started two years ago.  Cherry tomatoes are also more expensive to buy but they're one of the easiest types of tomatoes to grow at home. — Katherine MacKinnon This story was written by Malaka Gharib.

and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends. But he couldn’t be placed in just any nursing home — because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.

It’s like, ‘Oh, well, why don’t we give them an old folks home?’” Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. “But the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.” The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don’t have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.

The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.

The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world — what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans’ overfishing.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “It’s really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,” Luzietti said. “So learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,” she added. Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure. The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans — such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds. “We are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,” Luzietti said. “It’s important that we’re picking up on those — from how someone’s hips are moving, how they’re walking, how they are acting, if someone’s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.” On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert — who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey’s bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation. Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.

of her children. Jessica Bond Ferguson said she was alerted early Sunday by her 16-year-old son who said he thought he had seen a monkey running in the yard outside their home near Heidelberg, Mississippi. She got out of bed, grabbed her firearm and her cellphone and stepped outside where she saw the monkey about 60 feet (18 meters) away. Bond Ferguson said she and other residents had been warned that the escaped monkeys carried diseases so she fired her gun. “I did what any other mother would do to protect her children,” Bond Ferguson, who has five children ranging in age from 4 to 16, told The Associated Press. “I shot at it and it just stood there, and I shot again, and he backed up and that’s when he fell.” The Jasper County Sheriff’s Office confirmed in a social media post that a homeowner had found one of the monkeys on their property Sunday morning but said the office didn’t have any details. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks took possession of the monkey, the sheriff’s office said.

In a statement last week, Tulane said the monkeys do not belong to the university, and they were not being transported by the university. A truck carrying the monkeys overturned Tuesday on Interstate 59 north of Heidelberg. Of the 21 monkeys in the truck, 13 were found at the scene of the accident and arrived at their original destination last week, according to Tulane. Another five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday. The Mississippi Highway Patrol has said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the state capital, Jackson. Rhesus monkeys typically weigh about 16 pounds (7.2 kilograms) and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. Video recorded after the crash showed monkeys crawling through tall grass beside the interstate, where wooden crates labeled “live animals” were crumpled and strewn about. Jasper County Sheriff Randy Johnson had said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports by the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. Nonetheless, Johnson said the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature. The monkeys had recently received checkups confirming they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday. Rhesus macaques “are known to be aggressive,” according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. It said the agency’s conservation workers were working with sheriff’s officials in the search for the animals. The search comes about one year after 43 Rhesus macaques escaped from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research because an employee didn’t fully lock an enclosure. Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, had set up traps to capture them. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that of the 21 monkeys, 13 were taken from the accident scene and arrived at their original destination last week. Of the eight monkeys that were ejected from their cages, five were killed in the hunt for them and three remained on the loose before Sunday. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky: @mikeysid.bsky.social"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-cameroon-ivory-coast-elections-protests-democracy-83eb611f706c9568c24a0198055812e5","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:34+00:00","title":"African Elections 2025: Incumbents Re-elected Amid Protests, Authoritarian Trends, and Youth Dissent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of African elections in 2025 has seen incumbents reelected amid widespread protests, disputed results, and allegations of manipulation, including in Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Tanzania.

The elections featured a bureaucrat in Cameroon who has become the world’s oldest leader with half his life spent as president. An economist in Ivory Coast who is starting his fourth term at age 83. And a woman in Tanzania whose emergence as the country’s first female president had originally created hope that change was coming — but has been denounced for an authoritarian style. The continent of 1.4 billion people — where most countries have been independent for about 60 years — disputed election outcomes could further weaken shaky democracies and embolden soldiers increasingly taking over power , analysts says. Africa is home to some of the world’s youngest populations and oldest leaders, a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in coups from the Sahel region in the west to Madagascar . In many places there are deep frustrations over failed promises to provide populations with basic amenities despite rich natural resources.

He said all three countries feature incumbents leveraging state resources to stay in power, partisan security forces as well as flawed legal processes. “This is really symptomatic of competitive authoritarianism ... where elections are fundamentally imbalanced and skewed in favor of those already in power,” said Smith. “So the real issue is a lack of genuine political competition and accountability.” Here’s a quick look at the three elections: Cameroon’s Biya, world’s oldest leader, elected for eight term At 92, Paul Biya has spent nearly half his years on Earth as President of Cameroon and is Africa’s second-longest serving leader, behind only Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. After 43 years in power, he won his eight term in the country’s election on Oct. 12, which his spokesman-turned-challenger Issa Tchiroma Bakary also claims to have won . Biya is rarely seen in public and critics say his capacity to govern has been severely limited by his age. His reelection for an eighth seven-year term would keep him in office until he’s nearly 100. On Monday, some Cameroonian cities were on lockdown after Tchiroma called for that as a way for citizens to protest the election results. At least four people have been killed by security forces in recent demonstrations. Oumarou Bouba, a 27-year-old trader in the northern city of Maroua who has joined recent protests, said he will not back down despite arrests. “I am ready to stake my life to defend my vote,” Bouba said. Ivory Coast’s Ouattara wins a vote without his main challenger Ivory Coast’s President Alassane Ouattara, 83, was reelected to a fourth term in the Oct. 25 election marked by low turnout and empty streets after his main challenger was barred from running. A court had ruled that Tidjane Thiam , Ouattara’s main challenger and a former CEO of Credit Suisse, was not eligible to run because of his dual Ivorian-French nationality, a decision that Thiam vowed to fight. Born in Ivory Coast, Thiam received French nationality in 1987 but gave it up in March. He alleged he was excluded from the race to pave way for Ouattara’s reelection and called the election a sham. Protesters were arrested in the run-up to the election and more protests are scheduled to be held this week. Ouattara was first elected president in 2010 but not without challenges. Then-President Laurent Gbagbo, who lost the election to Ouattara, had refused to concede defeat, resulting in an electoral crisis with thousands killed. Gbagbo had to be forced out of power with the help of international peacekeepers. Tanzania’s female president sparked hope, then disappointment Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan was sworn in on Monday following a disputed election that excluded her two main rivals. The Oct. 29 election was marred by violence as protesters took to major streets to protest. The military was deployed to help police quell riots, and authorities have imposed internet outages amid the tensions. A former vice president who rose to the presidency after the death of predecessor John Pombe Magufuli, Hassan’s emergence as Tanzania’s first female president in 2021, at first brought hopes to millions after the government’s repressive tactics against opposition leaders, civic groups, journalists and others. Critics, however, said she has failed to ease repressions and instead has shown an authoritarian streak similar to her predecessor."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-chow-hang-tung-tiananmen-trial-3a90c935b16dc201356cfcb62fb366cb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"07:33:56+00:00","title":"Hong Kong Court Rejects Appeal of Former Tiananmen Vigil Organizer","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Hong Kong court rejected a former leader of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, Chow Hang-tung, in an appeal against her indictment for inciting subversion under the National Security Law.

former Tiananmen vigil organizer’s attempt to quash her indictment, pressing ahead with a landmark case widely seen as part of a yearslong crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement. Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group that organized a decades-old vigil to remember China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. She was charged together with two of the group’s other former leaders, Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan. Their case was brought under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 to quell massive anti-government protests in 2019. The trio were accused of inciting others to challenge the leadership of the Communist Party by unlawful means. Chow, who is a barrister and is defending herself, argued that the indictment was unacceptably broad and vague because authorities did not specify an unlawful means. She said it could amount to a “catch-all charge.” Judge Alex Lee remarked during the hearing that the charge was broad, but not vague. Related Stories The week golf in America goes quiet.

The three-judge panel, approved by the government to oversee the case, ruled against Chow. Lee said the panel would issue an opinion in January. Chow appeared calm when she learned about the decision and smiled to the public gallery before leaving the courtroom. The Tiananmen vigil, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, was the only large-scale public commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in China for decades until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures. The group came under increasing pressure as police opened an investigation , accusing it of being a foreign agent. The group rejected the allegations and refused to cooperate . Chow, Ho and Lee were later charged for violations of the National Security Law. In 2021, the alliance’s members voted to disband . Chow and two other core members of the group were convicted in 2023 for failing to provide authorities with information and received a sentence of 4 1/2 months each. But in March, the trio overturned their convictions at the city’s top court, marking a rare court victory for the city’s pro-democracy activists. A trial in the national security case is set for Jan. 22. Since pandemic-era gathering restrictions were lifted, the park where the vigil was previously held has been occupied on the Tiananmen anniversary by a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products. Fernando Cheung, spokesperson for Amnesty International Hong Kong Overseas, said the court’s decision on Monday showed that the authorities were “weaponizing the overly broad concept of ‘national security’ to suppress freedom of expression with impunity.” “Commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown should never have been prosecuted,” he said, calling for the release of those detained for what he called peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. The Hong Kong government insists that the city’s security law restored the city’s stability after the 2019 protests. ____ This version has been updated to correct the maximum penalty to 10 years, instead of life imprisonment."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-tariffs-7c44eedbf32bec35fc638e9953db2aeb","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:18:13+00:00","title":"Supreme Court to Consider Trump Tariff Case in Key Test of Presidential Power","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a pivotal case concerning President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs, citing national security and a fentanyl crisis.

2025-11-03T12:18:13+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A major question hangs over the Supreme Court’s closely watched case on President Donald Trump’s far-reaching tariffs : Will the conservative majority hold the Republican president to the same exacting standards it used to limit his Democratic predecessor , Joe Biden? Key legal principles at the heart of conservative challenges to major initiatives in the Biden years are driving the arguments in the fight against Trump’s tariffs, which is set for arguments at the high court on Wednesday. The businesses and states that sued over the tariffs are even name-checking the three Trump-appointed conservative justices whose votes they hope to attract to stop a centerpiece of Trump’s economic agenda in a key test of presidential power.

Until this year, no president had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs since its enactment in 1977. The law makes no mention of tariffs, taxes, duties or other similar words, although it does allow the president, after he declares an emergency, to regulate the importation of “any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” That authorization, the administration argued, is enough to support the tariffs, and the absence of any “magic words” is irrelevant. The court has ruled Congress must speak clearly on major policy questions During Biden’s presidency, conservative majorities made it harder to fight climate change under existing law and blocked several actions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The court ended a pause on evictions, prohibited a vaccine mandate for large businesses and rejected Biden’s $500 billion student loan forgiveness program. In each case, the court held that Congress had not clearly authorized an action of economic and political significance, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had little trouble applying those precedents to the tariffs case. Referring to the eviction pause and the student debt cases, a seven-judge majority wrote, “Indeed, the economic impact of the tariffs is predicted to be many magnitudes greater than the two programs that the Supreme Court has previously held to implicate major questions.” The tariff challengers are defending the appellate decision at the Supreme Court by leaning into the opinions from the earlier cases. “Absent vigilance under the major questions doctrine, ‘legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President,’” lawyers for a Chicago-area toy company, Learning Resources Inc., wrote, quoting an opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch in the climate change case. A separate group of small businesses cited Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion in the student loan case to make the point that in relying on IEEPA for the tariffs, Trump “asserts ‘highly consequential power ... beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.’” The businesses also invoked a dissenting opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh in another pandemic case about the dangers of easily accepting emergency declarations. “This Court’s history is littered with unfortunate examples of overly broad judicial deference to’ assertions of ‘emergency powers,’” lawyers for the businesses wrote. But does the major questions doctrine apply to the tariffs case? The Trump administration argues that the doctrine does not apply to the tariffs case, and it cites a lengthy dissenting appellate opinion, as well as Kavanaugh. Presidents have wide latitude when it comes to foreign affairs and national security, and it would be odd for the emergency powers law to be as limited as the challengers say it is, Judge Richard Taranto wrote in his dissent, which was joined by three other judges. “Such a limitation would be especially out of place in an emergency statute like IEEPA,” Taranto wrote, explaining that it was intended to give presidents flexibility to cope with crises. Congress, he concluded, made “an eyes-open” choice to give the president broad authority. The major questions doctrine does not apply, Taranto wrote. Kavanaugh expressed a similarly expansive view of presidential power in an opinion in June about congressional authority. The major questions doctrine has never been invoked in a case about foreign policy or national security, Kavanaugh wrote. “On the contrary, the usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the President substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people,” he wrote. Taranto’s opinion drew from a 1981 Supreme Court decision in a case relating to the Iranian hostage crisis that upheld President Jimmy Carter’s invocation of the emergency powers law to unfreeze Iranian assets. Justice William Rehnquist, five years before becoming chief justice, wrote the court’s opinion. One of his clerks that term was the current chief justice, John Roberts. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-amazon-071e752773dee5713c8b1a10039d08aa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:28:31+00:00","title":"OpenAI and Amazon Sign $38 Billion AI Infrastructure Deal","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI and Amazon have announced a $38 billion deal enabling OpenAI to run its AI systems—such as ChatGPT—on Amazon’s U.S. data centers through AWS, using hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s AI chips.

on Amazon’s data centers in the U.S. OpenAI will be able to power its AI tools using “hundreds of thousands” of Nvidia’s specialized AI chips through Amazon Web Services as part of the deal announced Monday. Amazon shares increased 4% after the announcement. The agreement comes less than a week after OpenAI altered its partnership with its longtime backer Microsoft, which until early this year was the startup’s exclusive cloud computing provider. California and Delaware regulators also last week allowed San Francisco-based OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit, to move forward on its plan to form a new business structure to more easily raise capital and make a profit. “The rapid advancement of AI technology has created unprecedented demand for computing power,” Amazon said in a statement Monday. It said OpenAI “will immediately start utilizing AWS compute as part of this partnership, with all capacity targeted to be deployed before the end of 2026, and the ability to expand further into 2027 and beyond.” AI requires huge amounts of energy and computing power and OpenAI has long signaled that it needs more capacity, both to develop new AI systems and keep existing products like ChatGPT answering the questions of its hundreds of millions of users. It’s recently made more than $1 trillion worth of financial obligations in spending for AI infrastructure, including data center projects with Oracle and SoftBank and semiconductor supply deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.

Millions of people stand to lose food aid benefits, health care subsidies are set to expire and there are few real talks between the parties over how to end it. President Donald Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday that he “won’t be extorted” by Democrats who are demanding negotiations to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Echoing congressional Republicans, the president said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” he’ll negotiate only when the government is reopened. Trump said Democrats “have lost their way” and predicted they’ll capitulate to Republicans. “I think they have to,” Trump said. “And if they don’t vote, it’s their problem.” Trump’s comments signal the shutdown could drag on for some time as federal workers, including air traffic controllers, are set to miss additional paychecks and there’s uncertainty over whether 42 million Americans who receive federal food aid will be able to access the assistance . Senate Democrats have voted 13 times against reopening the government, insisting they need Trump and Republicans to negotiate with them first.

Senate Republicans have repeatedly rejected that idea since Trump’s first term, arguing the rule requiring 60 votes to overcome any objections in the Senate is vital to the institution and has allowed them to stop Democratic policies when they’re in the minority. Trump said that’s true, but “we’re here right now.” Sen.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “Republicans have to get tougher,” Trump told CBS. “If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.” With the two parties at a standstill, the shutdown, now in its 34th day and approaching its sixth week, appears likely to become the longest in history. The previous record was set in 2019, when Trump demanded Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. A potentially decisive week President Donald Trump’s administration said Monday that it will partially fund SNAP after two judges issued rulings requiring it to keep the nation’s largest food aid program running. Trump’s push on the filibuster could prove a distraction for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Republican senators who’ve opted instead to stay the course as the consequences of the shutdown become more acute. Monthlong government shutdown in photos: disruptions, delays and divisions With no endgame in sight, the U.S. government shutdown is expected to roll on for the unforeseeable future, injecting more uncertainty into an already precarious economy. Republicans are hoping at least some Democrats will eventually switch their votes as moderates have been in weekslong talks with rank-and-file Republicans about potential compromises that could guarantee votes on health care in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans need five additional Democrats to pass their bill. Thune told reporters Monday that he was “optimistic” that the Senate could vote to reopen the government by the end of the week. But he also added, “If we don’t start seeing some progress or some evidence of that by at least the middle of this week, it’s hard to see how we would finish anything by the end of the week.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday there’s a group of people talking about ”a path to fix the health care debacle” and a commitment from Republicans not to fire more federal workers. But it’s unclear if those talks could produce a meaningful compromise. Far apart on health care subsidies Trump said in the “60 Minutes” interview that the Affordable Care Act — often known as Obamacare because it was signed and championed by then-President Barack Obama — is “terrible” and if the Democrats vote to reopen the government, “we will work on fixing the bad health care that we have right now.” READ MORE Trump administration says SNAP will be partially funded in November Some Head Start preschools shutter as government shutdown continues Democrats feel differently, arguing that the marketplaces set up by the ACA are working as record numbers of Americans have signed up for the coverage. But they want to extend subsidies first enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic so premiums won’t go up for millions of people on Jan. 1. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last week that “we want to sit down with Thune, with (House Speaker Mike) Johnson, with Trump, and negotiate a way to address this horrible health care crisis.” No appetite for bipartisanship As Democrats have pushed Trump and Republicans to negotiate, Trump has showed little interest in doing so . He called for an end to the Senate filibuster after a trip to Asia while the government was shut down. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that the president has spoken directly to Thune and Johnson about the filibuster. But a spokesman for Thune said Friday that his position hasn’t changed, and Johnson said Sunday that he believes the filibuster has traditionally been a “safeguard” from far-left policies. Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he likes Thune but “I disagree with him on this point.” The president has spent much of the shutdown mocking Democrats, posting videos of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries in a Mexican sombrero . The White House website is now featuring a satirical “My Space” page for Democrats, a parody based on the social media site that was popular in the early 2000s. “We just love playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” the page reads.

Republicans “can’t move on anything without a Trump sign off,” Warner said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

That came amid intensifying delays at the nation’s airports and multiple missed paydays for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on ABC’s “This Week” that there have already been delays at several airports “and it’s only going to get worse.” Many of the workers are “confronted with a decision,” he said. “Do I put food on my kids’ table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?” As flight delays around the country increased , New York City’s emergency management department posted on Sunday that Newark Airport was under a ground delay because of “staffing shortages in the control tower” and that they were limiting arrivals to the airport. “The average delay is about 2 hours, and some flights are more than 3 hours late,” the account posted.

The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold $8 billion needed for payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to fund it. The Trump administration indicated in court Monday that it will only partially fund SNAP this month by using a $4.65 billion emergency fund. That left the program in uncertainty with no clear indication of how much beneficiaries will receive or when their cards will be loaded to buy groceries. House Democratic leader Jeffries, D-N.Y., accused Trump and Republicans of attempting to “weaponize hunger.” He said that the administration has managed to find ways for funding other priorities during the shutdown, but is slow-walking pushing out SNAP benefits despite the court orders. “But somehow they can’t find money to make sure that Americans don’t go hungry,” Jeffries said in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ___ Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-guard-deployment-memphis-washington-f285c5a0f1ce2e23543f447f85ebf16e","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"04:57:46+00:00","title":"Tennessee and West Virginia Courts Challenge National Guard Deployment to Memphis and Washington, D.C. in Response to Trump’s Crime-Fighting Initiative","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s initiative to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-controlled cities like Memphis and Washington, D.C., has ignited a wave of legal challenges across Tennessee and West Virginia.

the streets of Memphis and Washington, D.C., respectively, as part of President Donald Trump’s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities. Judges in West Virginia and Tennessee did not immediately issue decisions. Trump’s enforcement efforts have unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings. Here’s what to know about the latest legal efforts on the issue: Tennessee court addresses Guard deployment in Memphis Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal in Nashville heard opposing takes about the governor’s authority to call the Guard. The individual state and local Democratic officials contend in a lawsuit that Republican Gov. Bill Lee cannot deploy the Tennessee National Guard for civil unrest unless there is a rebellion or invasion, and even then, it would require action by state lawmakers. Another provision spells out a need for a request from a local government to use the Guard in a “breakdown of law and order,” they said. The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction to block the Guard’s current use in the Memphis mission.

Tennessee law gives the governor “the authority to dispatch the Guard when needed and to determine when that need exists,” the state added. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on The state also argued that the plaintiff officials lacked legal standing to sue over the deployment and added that the issue is a political question, not one for the courts. Josh Salzman, an attorney with Democracy Forward representing the plaintiffs, called the state’s arguments about the governor’s authority “really terrifying.” After the hearing, Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti told reporters that “the argument is not that there’s no room for oversight,” saying that the Guard can’t do whatever it wants. “It’s that the determination of when the Guard should be brought out is statutorily left to the governor’s discretion.” Since their arrival on Oct. 10 , National Guard troops have been patrolling neighborhoods and commercial areas of Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid in downtown, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police.” Officials have said Guard members, who are armed, have no arrest power. Trump announced in September that the National Guard would accompany authorities from a slew of federal agencies as part of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force. Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who is not involved in the lawsuit, said he never requested that the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump made the announcement and Lee agreed, Young and others have said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders. The plaintiffs include Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, two county commissioners, one Memphis city councilman and three state lawmakers. Since they arrived Sept. 29, the federal agencies have made more than 1,500 arrests and issued thousands of traffic citations, according to statistics provided by the U.S. Marshals Service. Arrests have been made on charges ranging from homicides and drug and weapons violations to immigration warrants. Lee has said the National Guard would “play a critical support role” for local law enforcement. Young said earlier this month that operations include some 150 Guard members. The Memphis Safe Task Force includes 31 partner agencies across different levels of government and more than 1,700 personnel, according to a court declaration by Chad Hunt, chief inspector with the United States Marshals Service and the task force’s commander. Judge considers West Virginia deployment in D.C. West Virginia is among several states that sent National Guard members to Washington, D.C., to support Trump’s crime-fighting efforts. Last month, a West Virginia judge asked attorneys for the state to address whether Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s deployment of up to 300 Guard members to the nation’s capital in August was legal. A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says in a lawsuit that Morrisey exceeded his authority. Under state law, the group argues, the governor may deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state’s emergency request. Morrisey’s office has argued the deployment was authorized under federal law. After one witness for the plaintiff group testified Monday, the judge said the hearing would continue on Nov. 10. Kanawha County Circuit Judge Richard Lindsay in Charleston heard initial arguments in the case on Oct. 24. The civic group argued it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from government accountability and transparency. The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision. Lindsay rescheduled the hearing and ordered the state to focus on whether what Morrisey did was lawful. The West Virginia National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November. While Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, the U.S. Justice Department says violent crime there is at a 30-year low . Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them. Separately, a federal judge heard arguments Oct. 24 on District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb ’s request for an order that would remove National Guard members from Washington streets. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not rule from the bench. Judge blocks the Guard’s use in Portland The West Virginia and Tennessee hearings came after a federal judge on Sunday barred Trump’s administration from deploying the Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday , saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major milestone in its national space program.

immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/kimberly-clark-kenvue-tylenol-98d5fd39c12b25524e3188da2e840436","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:21:41+00:00","title":"Kimberly-Clark to Acquire Kenvue in $48.7 Billion Deal Amid Autism Controversy","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kimberly-Clark is acquiring Kenvue in a $48.7 billion cash and stock deal, forming a new consumer health giant with combined brands including Tylenol, Listerine, Band-Aid, Neutrogena, and Huggies. The merger, which requires shareholder approval from both companies, aims to combine strong brand portfolios and unlock value through operational efficiencies and better leadership. Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, has faced instability due to activist pressure, poor execution, and declining stock performance, prompting the acquisition. The deal raises concerns due to its size and the consumer goods sector’s poor merger track record, as exemplified by Kraft Heinz’s failed integration. Meanwhile, political figures like Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have amplified public controversy by promoting unproven links between Tylenol and autism, prompting Kenvue to publicly refute these claims and defend scientific integrity. Despite this, the merger is seen as a strategic move to strengthen market presence in key personal care and health segments where consumers remain loyal to branded products, even as store brands gain ground. The combined company is expected to generate $32 billion in annual revenue and achieve $1.9 billion in cost savings over three years, with the deal projected to close in the second half of 2025.

Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark.

Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive ... especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism . Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger . Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41Z","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, particularly in the UNESCO-listed ancient cities of Hue and Hoi An, has triggered severe flooding, with water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers exceeding historical highs set in 2020.

top tourism destinations Hue, a former imperial capital, and the ancient town of Hoi An.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vietnam’s disaster management agency recorded more than 1,000 millimetres (39.4 inches) of rainfall over a 24-hour period ending late on Monday in parts of Hue and Hoi An.\n\nVietnam’s National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said the volume of rainfall in Hue marked the highest ever for a 24-hour period since the country started its record-keeping.\n\nThe newspaper VNExpress reported that water levels in the Huong and Bo rivers, which flow through Hue, reached 5.25m (17.2 ft) on Monday afternoon, shattering the previous historical high recorded in 2020.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, water levels from both rivers have receded, but Hue remains submerged by more than one metre (3.3ft) of water.\n\nImages showed a wide area of the ancient city, including the palace grounds, under murky waters.\n\nAuthorities in Hue were quoted by the state news agency Vietnam News as saying that the rain and flooding may last until Friday.\n\nThe area was designated a world heritage site in 1993 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe heavy rain also triggered a massive landslide of red mud on Tuesday morning about 3km (1.9 miles) long in coastal Quang Ngai province, leaving about 1,700 people isolated, authorities said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 8,600 people in four central provinces were evacuated due to risks from severe flooding and landslides.\n\nHeavy flooding has also forced the state-run Vietnam Railways Corp to suspend services between the capital Hanoi and the business hub Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe government said in a separate report that more than 306,000 households and businesses in Hue, Danang and Quang Tri provinces were suffering from blackouts.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming increasingly powerful as the planet warms due to human-induced climate change.\n\nThis month’s rainfall comes after  Typhoon Bualoi  battered the country in September, leaving at least 13 people dead and 20 others missing.\n\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, natural disasters — mostly storms, floods and landslides — left 187 people dead or missing in the country in the first nine months of 2025, with total economic losses estimated at more than $610m."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note

efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, caused significant destruction across the Caribbean.

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean in late October 2025, killing at least 34 people across Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction\n\nPeople across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated multiple Caribbean nations in October 2025, killing at least 32 people.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/landslides-in-kenyas-rift-valley-leave-21-dead-30-others-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-02","timeOfPublication":"02:38:49Z","title":"Landslides in Kenya’s Rift Valley leave 21 dead, 30 others missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Heavy rains in Kenya’s western Rift Valley, specifically in the Chesongoch area of Elgeyo-Marakwet County, triggered deadly landslides and flash floods, killing at least 21 people and leaving 30 others missing.

2025-10-23T15:45:13+00:00\n\nTitle: Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/former-us-vice-president-dick-cheney-dies-at-84","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:33:22+00:00","title":"Former US Vice President Dick Cheney dead at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has died at the age of 84, following complications from pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.

first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing about 50 people in Jamaica and at least 31 in Haiti.

battering communities in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

Foreigner, Lil Jon, Kool & the Gang, Busta Rhymes, Mickey Guyton and Teyana Taylor will feature in this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, which will also cement “KPop Demon Hunters” as a pop culture phenomenon with appearances by the movie’s singers on the ground and cute characters in balloons overhead. An eclectic group of stars — from ballet dancer Tiler Peck to YouTube’s “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans — will join the annual holiday kick-off, highlighted by Audrey Nuna, EJAE and Rei Ami of HUNTR/X, the fictional girl group at the heart of the Netflix K-pop hit. The trio are behind the film’s soundtrack, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and recently went platinum. Two characters from the movie — Derpy Tiger and Sussie — will join the parade lineup as a mid-sized balloon and the adorably named balloonicle. The parade will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 27 in all time zones and will feature 32 balloons, three ballonicles, 27 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus. The familiar TV hosts — Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker from the “Today” show — will return on NBC and Peacock. More stars will be announced later. Broadway, Buzz Lightyear and Debbie Gibson Broadway will be represented by cast members from “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time” and “Ragtime,” while the Radio City Rockettes will be there and some serious athletes — three-time U.S. national champion figure skater Ilia Malinin and U.S Paralympian Jack Wallace. Every year, spectators line-up a half-dozen deep along the route to cheer the floats, entertainers and marching bands. Last year, more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade. This year, four new featured character balloons will debut, including Buzz Lightyear, Pac-Man, Mario from Super Mario Brothers and a 32-foot-tall (9.8-meter) balloon onion carriage featuring eight characters from the world of “Shrek.” Ahead of next year’s 100th anniversary of the parade, organizers are also including balloons from previous marches, including Rainbow trout, the Happy Hippo Triple Stack, Wigglefoot and Freida the Dachshund. Six new floats will also debut this year, including from Holland America Line, Lego, Lindt chocolates, “Stranger Things” and a bunch of whimsical sheep trying to get to sleep courtesy of Serta.

2025-11-04T10:06:19+00:00\n\nTitle: Doha declaration ‘booster shot for development’ amid global uncertainty: UN\n\nDoha, Qatar  – A declaration of intent to fight deepening global inequality is a “booster shot for development”, the head of the United Nations declares.\n\nAt the Second World Summit for Social Development in Qatar on Tuesday, the president of the UN General Assembly, Annalena Baerbock, announced the adoption of the Doha Political Declaration.\n\n“Social development and inclusion is essential for strong societies,” she said, adding that the declaration must “end social injustice and guarantee dignity for everyone, prioritising a people-first approach.”\n\nIn a keynote speech, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on global leaders to unite behind the “bold people’s plan”.\n\n“It’s unconscionable that nearly 700 million people still live in extreme poverty while the richest 1 per cent own nearly half of global wealth,” he told the delegations.\n\n“It’s intolerable that almost four billion people lack access to any form of social protection at all.”\n\nThe summit in Qatar’s capital, Doha, was convened to build on the development goals established 30 years ago during the Copenhagen Summit.\n\nAccording to the UN, about 40 heads of state, 170 ministerial-level representatives, heads of NGOs and  14,000 delegates  from around the world were expected to attend.\n\nThe declaration calls for commitments in several areas, including poverty eradication, access to “decent work”, social integration, gender equality and climate action.\n\nGuterres noted the progress that has been made over the past three decades.\n\n“Over one billion people have escaped extreme poverty. Global unemployment is at a near-historic low. Access to healthcare, education and social protection has dramatically expanded. People are living longer, and child and maternal mortality have declined. And more girls are attending school with rising graduation rates for all students,” he said.\n\nHowever, he insisted that more challenges must be faced, saying the Second World Summit “opens at a moment of high global uncertainty, divisions, conflicts and widespread human suffering”.\n\n“Developing countries are not getting the level of support they need,” he warned. “We are not moving fast enough to mitigate the volatility and outright destruction wrought by a warming planet.”\n\nQatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, opened the event by calling for sustained efforts to support the Palestinian people amid the devastation of Israel’s two-year war on Gaza.\n\n“It’s impossible to achieve social development in any society without peace and stability,” he said, adding that only “constant peace, not temporary settlements, is just peace.”\n\nCalling on the international community to increase support for reconstruction, he added: “It goes without saying that the Palestinian people need all forms of aid to be able to recover from the devastation” caused by “the apartheid system in Palestine”.\n\nThe UN estimates  more than $70bn  is needed to rebuild Gaza.\n\nAddressing reporters on the sidelines later, Guterres said he was “deeply concerned” by “continued violations of the ceasefire” in the enclave.\n\n“They must stop, and all parties must abide by the decisions of the first phase of the peace agreement,” he demanded.\n\nThe emir also condemned the war crimes being carried out in Sudan.\n\n“We express our collective shock at the horrific atrocities committed in the city of el-Fasher in Sudan’s Darfur region and reaffirm our condemnation of these acts in the strongest terms,” Sheikh Tamim said after the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group captured the capital of North Darfur State last week."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article addresses the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as involving only 'noncritical' tests—testing components without nuclear explosions. The U.S. maintains a 30-year moratorium on explosive nuclear testing since 1992, and officials like the National Nuclear Security Administration assert that the stockpile remains safe through advanced simulations and regular reviews. Experts warn that resuming explosive tests would dangerously escalate nuclear tensions, prompting responses from Russia and potentially China, and would undermine decades of global nuclear restraint. The article highlights that while China's nuclear arsenal is growing rapidly, there is no credible evidence of active explosive testing by China, Russia, or Pakistan. It emphasizes the distinction between noncritical and explosive testing, noting that such nonexplosive methods, including subcritical experiments, are used for safety and reliability assessments.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/nyc-mayoral-election-candidates-polls-results-and-whats-at-stake","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:13:10+00:00","title":"NYC mayoral election: Candidates, polls, results and what’s at stake","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 New York City mayoral election has become a defining moment in U.S. politics, with Zohran Mamdani, a young Muslim, immigrant, and democratic socialist, emerging as the leading candidate and poised to become the city’s first Muslim and first African-born mayor.

2025-11-04T10:13:10+00:00\n\nTitle: NYC mayoral election: Candidates, polls, results and what’s at stake\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in the largest city of the United States, New York, will choose a new mayor in a race that has stirred debate across the country and drawn global interest.\n\nZohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assembly democratic socialist who   surprised  many with his June win in the Democratic Party’s primary, is facing former Governor Andrew Cuomo, now running as an independent after losing the Democratic nomination. Republican Curtis Sliwa is among the other candidates in the race.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nVoters on both coasts of the US will cast ballots in a series of elections: gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia, the New York City mayoral race, and a vote in California on a redistricting measure.\n\nBut of these electoral battles, it is the New York mayoral vote that has grabbed the most attention .\n\nThe three leading candidates are Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is running on a platform focused on affordability, calling for rent freezes, universal childcare, cheaper public transport, and a raise in the hourly minimum wage to $30. An immigrant, Muslim, and democratic socialist, his popularity has surged during the campaign, with nearly 370,000 early ballots already cast, and appealing strongly to young voters.\n\nMamdani, whose parents have Indian roots, was born in Uganda. If elected, he will be the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first to be born in Africa, and the first of South Asian descent.\n\nCuomo served as New York state’s governor from 2011 to 2021 and resigned after a state inquiry confirmed sexual harassment allegations by 13 women. He lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani (56 percent to 44 percent), but stayed in the race as an independent.\n\nAt 71, Sliwa  has resisted  pressure to withdraw from the race amid concerns he could split the anti-Mamdani vote. Known for his trademark red beret, he rose to prominence as the leader of the Guardian Angels, a volunteer crime-fighting group that became famous for its patrols of the New York subway system.\n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics  average shows  Democratic nominee Mamdani leading the mayoral race with 46.1 percent , giving him a 14.3-point edge over Cuomo (31.8 percent ) and a 29.8-point lead over Sliwa (16.3 percent ).\n\nUS President Donald Trump and businessman Elon Musk backed Cuomo late on Monday. Whether that high-profile, last-minute support will shift voter sentiment remains uncertain.\n\nPolling stations across the city will open on November 4 at 6am local time (11:00 GMT) and voting will continue till 9pm (02:00 GMT on November 5).\n\nEarly voting took place from October 25 to November 2.\n\nIn New York, mayoral races are usually called quickly.\n\nThis time, however, with two candidates vying for the support of the city’s mostly Democratic voters, it may take longer to determine the outcome.\n\nThe 2021 mayoral race ended quickly – Democrat Eric Adams was declared the winner soon after the polls closed.\n\nBeing the US’s most diverse city, known around the world for its business and culture, makes picking a new mayor an especially important occasion.\n\nNew York’s election campaigns have mirrored the bigger national debates in the US, over identity, religion, political beliefs, and the country’s future.\n\nSome of the key issues include:\n\nCost of living:  The city is facing one of its tightest housing markets in decades. In 2023 the city had a vacancy rate of 1.41 percent , which means that only 14 out of every 1,000 housing units were unoccupied; 9.2 percent of all rental housing was described by city authorities as “overcrowded”. The number of new housing permits issued fell in 2024 compared with 2023.\n\nThis has made housing cost and availability a dominant issue. After a slate of California cities, New York is the costliest urban hub in the US to live in.\n\n“Most of us are working multiple jobs, can’t make rent or rents are going up,” Tom Grabher, a city voter, told Al Jazeera.\n\nLaw and order:  Serious crimes in the city, including murder, have gone down from their 17-year high in 2023. However, lower-level offences, such as shoplifting, remain higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic, adding to public worries about safety and disorder.\n\nMigration:  The city has long been a magnet for people from around the world, from its historic role as a gateway for immigrants to the recent influx of asylum seekers that critics say has placed new strains on the city’s resources.\n\nIsrael and Gaza:  The ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict and the city’s large Jewish and Muslim populations have made foreign policy a key issue in this race.\n\nA former New Yorker, Trump has loomed over the mayoral race for months, threatening to arrest Mamdani, deport him, and take control of the city if he wins.\n\nOn Monday, Trump urged the city’s voters on his Truth Social platform to back Cuomo, saying they had “no choice” but to vote for the former governor.\n\nWhen the federal government shut down in October, Trump put on hold roughly $18bn in federal funds, although $187m from New York’s security funding has since been restored. Trump has threatened to withhold more federal aid for the city if Mamdani wins.\n\nAll eyes are on Virginia, a state next to Washington, DC, that has been directly affected by Trump’s spending cuts and the recent government shutdown.\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger is facing off against Republican Lieutenant-Governor Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nIn New Jersey, the governor’s race has centred on concerns about affordability. Although Democrats hold a voter advantage, Republicans are optimistic that Trump’s rising popularity in the state could lead to a surprise win. Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is up against Republican Jack Ciattarelli , a former state assemblyman.\n\nIn California, a proposed ballot measure would redraw congressional districts in a way that could benefit Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. Governor Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers say they introduced the plan in response to Trump’s earlier push for Texas to reshape its districts to give Republicans an advantage in five seats currently held by Democrats. If approved, the measure would effectively eliminate five Republican-held districts in California."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/could-trump-curb-voters-rights-before-2026-us-midterms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:33:22+00:00","title":"Could Trump curb voters’ rights before 2026 US midterms?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States President Donald Trump is pushing to alter election systems before the 2026 midterms, despite lacking constitutional authority.

2026 US midterms?\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump wants to change the way Americans vote, and he wants to do it before the 2026 midterms.\n\nUS presidents do not have the authority to overhaul state election laws. The US Constitution leaves congressional election management to states and rule-making to Congress.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Trump from taking a top-down approach to altering election practices a year out from the November 3 elections – contests that will determine whether Trump has congressional support for his agenda, including his immigration enforcement tactics and tax and spending cuts.\n\nHere are some of the ways Trump is pressuring states and Congress to change how those elections will go:\n\nTrump relied on falsehoods when pushing for voting changes in a speech to governors, repeatedly making what PolitiFact classified as the “ p ants on fire ” statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” and threatening to jail people he said rigged the election.\n\nWe asked the White House why Trump wants to overhaul elections. He won under 2016 and 2024 laws, and his party won both chambers of Congress in 2024. The White House referred us to the Justice Department.\n\n“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair and transparent elections,” Harmeet K Dhillon, an assistant attorney general, told PolitiFact. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”\n\nTrump’s actions have alarmed election officials who have promised to protect the rights of voters during the midterms.\n\n“I am confident we will have safe, free and secure elections in 2026, but it is going to be up to state and local election officials because the federal government right now is not being supportive and indeed is targeting election officials,” said Shenna Bellows, Maine’s secretary of state and a Democratic gubernatorial candidate.\n\nIn its search to identify ineligible voters, the Justice Department has requested voter registration files from most states.\n\nVoter registration rolls have sensitive personal identifying information. Many states have laws that would prohibit them from disclosing information such as birth dates and driver’s licence or Social Security numbers. Election experts have raised privacy concerns about voters’ identifying information being widely shared, pointing to similar concerns involving the Department of Government Efficiency’s use of Social Security data.\n\nSome states provided only publicly available data to the federal government.\n\nBellows told the Justice Department to “go jump in the Gulf of Maine”.\n\nMaine was among the states the Justice Department sued in September, accusing them of not turning over certain voter roll information.\n\nIn its lawsuit against Maine, the department demanded Bellows hand over all information on the state’s voter rolls, including Social Security or driver’s licence numbers. Maine opposes releasing that information because centralisation of voter data increases the possibility of breach, Bellows told PolitiFact.\n\n“Voting in a democracy depends on free and fair participation without fear of retribution or punishment from the government,” Bellows said. “If Congress thought it was a good idea to have a national voter registration list, they could authorise that, but they have not done so.”\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law found that nearly all the states that replied to the requests did not share their full databases. The states omitted Social Security and driver’s licence numbers or provided no lists. Only Indiana and Wyoming provided their full statewide voter registration lists.\n\nAcross the country, voter roll maintenance is handled by state and local officials who routinely remove people who have relocated, died or are otherwise ineligible. Federal law, meanwhile, already bans noncitizens from voting in federal elections. But Trump has spread falsehoods about noncitizen voting for a decade.\n\nAfter reports by the Reuters news agency and The New York Times, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to PolitiFact that it is sharing information with the Justice Department with the goal of identifying noncitizen voters.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to find noncitizen voters, such as overhauling a database that election officials use to verify voters’ citizenship status. Voting rights advocates have cautioned that the data might be outdated for immigrants who have since become naturalised US citizens.\n\nOn August 18, Trump said he will move to “ end mail-in ballots ” and sign an “executive order to help bring honesty to the 2026 elections”. Any attempt to abolish or overhaul states’ voting-by-mail programmes would face legal challenges, which may explain why the order has not materialised.\n\nThe following day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt signalled Trump could pursue a legislative route, saying there “will be many discussions with our friends on Capitol Hill and also our friends in state legislatures”.\n\nTrump has continued his threats against mail-in voting, promising in September “to fix this system”.\n\n“No mail-in or ‘Early’ Voting” he echoed in an October 26 Truth Social post that criticised California for sending millions of mail ballots for the redistricting vote.\n\nThe state is one of eight that allows all-mail elections. In the November 2024 elections, about 30 percent of voters, or about 48 million people, cast ballots by mail, including people who are elderly, can’t drive, live far from a voting site or are overseas. Mail-in voting has been around at least since the Civil War.\n\nIn March, Trump issued an executive order that would cut off Election Assistance Commission funding to states that count mail ballots received after Election Day. The order, which has an exception for military and overseas voters, has led to multiple lawsuits.\n\nAbout 16 states allow officials to count ballots received after Election Day as long as they were postmarked by Election Day (or in the case of Ohio, the day before Election Day), according to the National Vote at Home Institute.\n\nThe White House position is that federal laws establish Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, so that should be the mail ballot receipt deadline.\n\nNineteen states together sued the administration, arguing that the US Constitution gives the states the primary responsibility to regulate elections. The states of Washington and Oregon filed their own lawsuit. A federal judge preliminarily blocked that provision in Trump’s order.\n\nMinnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said voters should pay attention to Trump’s attempts to stretch his legal authority and tangle with states.\n\n“I think the next six months or so will be crucial in making sure we remain on course and elections are fair, accurate, honest and secure,” Simon said.\n\nTrump pushed Republican-led states to undertake unusual mid-decade redistricting to maximise congressional seats for the party.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott signed a new map in August that Republicans hope will lead to five additional Republican-held seats. Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe also signed a new map into law although voters are collecting signatures in hopes of holding a referendum to overturn that map in 2026. Ohio’s redistricting commission settled on a new map, as did the North Carolina legislature.\n\nOther Republican-led states, including Florida, Indiana and Louisiana, could follow.\n\nSome Democratic leaders have floated redistricting their states to wipe out Republican gains. California voters will decide on Tuesday if they want to redistrict in an effort led by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. Democrats have also pushed for redistricting in Virginia, Maryland and Illinois.\n\nIf Trump’s efforts to create more Republican House seats are successful, it would make it even harder for the Democrats to flip the House.\n\nTrump created the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) during his first term to protect critical infrastructure, including elections, from threats. CISA became a target of Trump after the agency affirmed the security of the 2020 elections, during which he lost the presidency to Joe Biden.\n\nCISA has provided training, threat information and physical and cybersecurity assessments of election facilities with election officials, improving security for voters.\n\nIt’s unclear what role CISA will play in the 2026 elections. Any reduced federal response to election security could harm voters’ faith in elections and embolden domestic or foreign bad actors.\n\nA former government official told the Axios news site that about one-third of CISA staff had left the agency by early June, a few months after CISA froze its election security work pending a review and did not publicly release the results. The administration also cut funding for an information-sharing collaboration among local, state and federal officials. Trump’s budget proposal for 2026 calls for further cuts.\n\nBecause of CISA security training, Rhode Island election workers knew how to respond when an envelope containing white powder with the return address “US Traitor Elimination Army” arrived at the state Board of Elections in September 2024. CISA had already distributed physical security and cybersecurity checklists with tips about how to respond to such a threat.\n\nThe substance turned out not to be dangerous, but the quick security alerts and information from CISA help election officials “know what is happening in real time without having to wait for news reports or word of mouth”, Nick Lima, elections director for the city of Cranston, Rhode Island, told PolitiFact.\n\nSo far, John C Ackerman, the county clerk/recorder in Tazewell County, Illinois, said he hasn’t seen fewer services from CISA. He told PolitiFact the agency still sends bulletins about threats and a monthly vulnerability scan of the county’s website.\n\nWhen we asked CISA if it still offers security assessments and additional assistance to election officials, we received a statement that did not address our questions.\n\nThe Trump administration has hired people in election roles who denied Trump’s 2020 election loss or spread falsehoods about voting.\n\nHeather Honey, a Pennsylvania activist who spread election falsehoods, now works in an election integrity role at the Homeland Security Department. Marci McCarthy, now the CISA spokesperson, chaired the DeKalb County Republican Party, which filed an unsuccessful lawsuit arguing that Georgia’s voting machines were vulnerable. As FBI director, Kash Patel, who has repeated Trump’s falsehood about a rigged 2020 election, could oversee investigations of election crimes and election-related civil rights violations.\n\nMichael Moore, the chief information security officer for Arizona’s secretary of state, told PolitiFact in an email that while there are still employees at CISA who want to help, “it seems they have neither the resources nor direction to effectively help.”\n\n“I strongly believe in the mission of CISA and want a return of our prior relationship and support level,” Moore said. “We’re the United States of America for a reason. In this current landscape, it feels more like every state for themselves.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/russia-will-not-attack-any-other-european-country-albanian-pm-edi-rama","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:24:29+00:00","title":"‘Russia will not attack any other European country’: Albanian PM Edi Rama","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has dismissed concerns that Russia may attack European countries, stating that Russia will not target Albania or any other EU nation due to NATO’s strength and the absence of Russian sympathy in Albania.

2025-11-04T11:24:29+00:00\n\nTitle: ‘Russia will not attack any other European country’: Albanian PM Edi Rama\n\nBerlin, Germany –  Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has played down Western  concerns  that  Russia  is preparing for further conflicts in Europe and suggested the European Union should have a concrete peace plan in place for Ukraine amid efforts by the United States to end the war.\n\nRama, speaking to Al Jazeera on the sidelines of the Berlin Global Dialogue conference late last month, said it would be “completely stupid” of any country to attack EU or NATO members.\n\n“Russia will not attack Albania and Russia will not attack any other European country,” he said. “NATO is ready for any kind of aggression. NATO has nobody and nothing to fear because it’s the strongest army in the world so far.”\n\nTwenty-three out of 27 EU member states are NATO members. Albania is part of NATO and has been an EU candidate country since 2014.\n\n“The EU is being provoked a lot by Russia,” said Rama. “Countries on the border with Russia are being provoked on a daily basis … the EU is defending itself and thinking of defending itself better.”\n\nSince early September,  several European countries , including Poland, Finland, Latvia,  Lithuania , Norway and Romania, have blamed Russia for a series of suspected drone incursions. Tensions soared further on September 19, when NATO said it intercepted three Russian MiG-31 jets suspected of entering Estonian airspace, a claim denied by Moscow.\n\nLast month, German foreign intelligence chief Martin Jager warned lawmakers that to grow its “sphere of influence further westward into  Europe ”, Russia would “shy away from direct military confrontation with NATO if necessary”.\n\nMoscow has dismissed accusations that it has deliberately sent drones into European airspace, blaming those countries for  stoking hysteria .\n\nRama’s government has been vocal in its criticism of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and supports EU sanctions on Moscow.\n\nBut he told Al Jazeera, “The fact that the EU does not have a peace plan looks very strange to me.”\n\nAs US President Donald Trump attempts to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, Rama said the EU should “think about having its own diplomacy in action to promote its own vision of peace”.\n\nHe also suggested EU officials should “find a way to talk to the Russians” to end the war.\n\nLate on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had not seen a European plan to end the war, according to Interfax news agency.\n\nRama claimed that Albania, which has not reported any Russian drone sightings, feels little pressure despite the apparent incursions, as Eastern European countries bordering Russia are on high security alert.\n\n“I’m Albanian,” Rama said. “We have no fears … There is no room for Russian hostilities in Albania because there is no sympathy for Russia.”\n\nBefore the suspected airspace violations, Moscow had  long been accused  of engaging in “ hybrid warfare ”, using unconventional methods such as cyberattacks or disinformation campaigns to drive a wedge between EU countries. The drone incursions, the bloc says, are part of that tactic.\n\nThere are fears that Russia’s war could spill over into the Western Balkans, comprising – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, self-declared republic of Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and  Serbia  – home to deep-rooted tensions.\n\nOn October 22, when Rama’s British counterpart Keir Starmer hosted him and the five other Western Balkans leaders, the premier of the United Kingdom called the region “Europe’s crucible – the place where the security of our continent is put to the test”.\n\nThe six nations are at varying levels of negotiations with the EU regarding accession, attempting to reform sectors from their judiciaries to social welfare departments in order to join the bloc.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently praised the progress made by Montenegro and Albania.\n\nIn Tirana on October 25, in a news conference alongside Rama, she said Albania is on “the right track towards the European Union”, adding, “there has been a stunning and outstanding record speed acceleration since 2022”.\n\nRama agreed, telling Al Jazeera that the EU’s sense of openness in welcoming the Balkan nations has improved since the Ukraine war began."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/4/live-joy-in-gaza-as-palestinians-freed-by-israel-reunite-with-families","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Thousands in ‘overcrowded shelters’ amid continued Israeli shelling on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ongoing Israeli artillery shelling in southern Gaza and destruction in eastern parts of Gaza City have led to thousands of people being forced into overcrowded shelters.

him?\n\nAs his hometown of New York  votes for its next mayor , United States President Donald Trump has thrown his support behind Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and former New York state governor who is standing as an independent this time.\n\nThe Republican president’s endorsement of Cuomo – who lost the Democratic primary to self-described democratic socialist  Zohran Mamdani  in June – came just hours before polling booths open on Tuesday in the closely watched election.\n\nTrump has called Mamdani, a Muslim immigrant who is campaigning on a promise to make New York more affordable for its residents via rent freezes and universal childcare, a “ communist “. He has also threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani wins.\n\n“I would much rather see a Democrat, who has had a Record of Success, WIN, than a Communist with no experience and a Record of COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nMamdani is currently leading the polls with 46 percent support – a double-digit lead over Cuomo’s 32 percent. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, is trailing in third place at 16 percent. Trump discouraged voters from choosing Sliwa, saying: “A vote for Curtis Sliwa … is a vote for Mamdani.”\n\nBut will an endorsement from Trump help or hinder Cuomo’s already slim chances of winning the race?\n\nTrump’s support for Cuomo, who stepped down as governor of New York in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations, appears largely driven by his opposition to Mamdani.\n\nMamdani has denied Trump’s description of him as a communist.\n\nIn June, PolitiFact  debunked claims  that Mamdani is a communist. “Communism involves a centrally planned economy with no market forces. Prices and quantities are set by a central government authority. There is no democratic political competition, and instead a single party rules the country. He is not calling for any of this,” Stanford University Professor Anna Grzymala-Busse told PolitiFact.\n\nHowever, Trump maintains that with Mamdani at the helm in New York, “this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!”\n\n“I don’t want to send, as President, good money after bad,” he said, referring to his threat to withhold federal funding from New York City. “His principles have been tested for over a thousand years, and never once have they been successful.”\n\nTrump’s outright backing of Cuomo follows his more tepid one in an interview on the CBS TV network’s 60 Minutes programme that was filmed at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday and aired on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump said on the show.\n\n“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him and hope he does a fantastic job,” Trump added. “[Cuomo] is capable of it. Mamdani is not!”\n\nThe former governor has sought to distance himself from Trump’s comments.\n\n“He didn’t say that. He didn’t say that. He did not say that,” Cuomo told reporters on Monday when asked about Trump’s comments on 60 Minutes.\n\nHe added: “Mamdani is not a communist. He’s a socialist. But we don’t need a socialist mayor either.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Washington Heights neighbourhood, Cuomo said: “He [Trump] called me a bad Democrat. First of all, I happen to be a good Democrat and a proud Democrat, and I’m going to stay a proud Democrat.”\n\nAfter Cuomo lost the Democratic primary race to Mamdani in June, Trump publicly urged him to stay in the race – and also reportedly spoke with Cuomo about his campaign.\n\nSince then, however, Cuomo has emphasised that he has no allegiance to Trump and insisted he will do a better job of standing up to the president as New York mayor.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Mamdani has painted Cuomo as Trump’s choice for mayor, calling him a puppet of the president in deeply Democratic New York, and he was quick to react to Trump’s latest comments.\n\n“We’ve known since the primary that Andrew Cuomo was funded by the same billionaires that gave us Donald Trump’s second term. Even just until these final days, [Cuomo] denied that he was Donald Trump’s preferred candidate,” Mamdani said in an interview with CNN late on Monday.\n\n“But now it’s written out for the entire world to see,” Mamdani said, adding: “This is the man that Donald Trump wants to be the next mayor of New York City and not because he’ll be good for New Yorkers but because he’ll be good for Donald Trump, and New Yorkers are exhausted of this agenda in Washington.”\n\nMamdani’s campaign has also highlighted that Cuomo received an endorsement from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and once a staunch ally of Trump.\n\nMamdani also responded to Trump’s threat to restrict funds for New York if he wins. “It’s not Donald Trump’s to decide which city or state will get what money,” the Democratic candidate said. “This is the money that New Yorkers are owed, and this is the money that we’re going to fight for.”\n\nMamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has campaigned for universal free childcare, free public buses and a rent freeze for New Yorkers.\n\n“He is spending $300m remodelling a White House ballroom, the same amount of money that could provide SNAP [ food assistance ] benefits for 100,000 New Yorkers,” Mamdani said, taking a dig at the president.\n\nTrump lost the vote in New York City himself by wide margins in all three presidential runs he has made since 2016.\n\nBut compared to 2016 and 2020, he dramatically shrunk the margins in 2024, winning more than 30 percent of the vote — the first time any Republican has since 1988.\n\nAn overview of Cuomo’s performance in the Democratic primary this year shows an overlap in his support and the neighbourhoods where Trump won votes in his 2024 presidential run, including parts of southern Brooklyn, Staten Island’s North Shore and sections of Queens, particularly with older, working-class and Orthodox Jewish populations.\n\nSo in theory, Trump’s support could bolster Cuomo’s chances in some of these neighbourhoods.\n\nBut Trump’s backing could also prove a double-edged sword for Cuomo.\n\nOverall, the city leans heavily towards Democrats, so it is no surprise that Mamdani’s campaign has consistently been projecting Cuomo as a proxy for Trump.\n\nCuomo did especially well in the primary against Mamdani in neighbourhoods with large Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nBut while Trump made major gains with both communities in 2024, his support among Black Americans and Hispanic Americans has dropped since. Trump’s plans to arrest and deport immigrants has disproportionately hurt Latino communities across the US.\n\nPolls suggest Mamdani may struggle to cross the 50 percent threshold, but New York follows a first-past-the-post system, so whoever gets the most votes wins.\n\nSliwa has rejected repeated calls over the months to quit the race and instead rally his supporters behind Cuomo, who could close the gap with Mamdani if Sliwa supporters do switch sides.\n\nA Marist New York City poll last week — when Mamdani was leading with 48 percent support, Cuomo at 32 percent and Sliwa at 16 percent — also found that if Sliwa were to drop out of the race, Mamdani would receive overall support from 50 percent of likely voters compared with 44 percent for Cuomo.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Cuomo has also appealed to GOP supporters, saying a vote for the Republican Sliwa is a vote for Mamdani."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/starbucks-sells-majority-stake-in-china-business-as-it-eyes-expansion","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:15:04+00:00","title":"Starbucks sells majority stake in China business as it eyes expansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks has announced the sale of its majority stake in its China operations to Hong Kong-based private equity firm Boyu Capital for $4 billion, with Boyu taking a 60% stake through a joint venture.

in its Chinese business for $4bn to a Hong Kong-based private equity firm after years of losing market share to local competitors in China.\n\nStarbucks announced the sale on Monday, which will see the firm Boyu Capital take a 60 percent stake in its Chinese retail operations through a joint venture.\n\nBoyu Capital has offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore, and its cofounders include Alvin Jiang, the grandson of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe US coffee giant will retain a 40 percent interest in its China operations while maintaining its ownership of the company’s brand and intellectual property, the company said.\n\nThe deal marks a “new chapter” in Starbucks’s 26-year-long history in China, the company said in a statement.\n\nIt will also give Starbucks a much-needed injection of funding and logistical support as it tries to expand its business deeper into China, according to Jason Yu, the Shanghai-based managing director of CTR Market Research.\n\nStarbucks has 8,000 locations across China, but it aspires to open as many as 20,000 through its joint venture, the company said in a statement.\n\n“Starbucks used to be a pioneer in coffee in China, where it was probably the first coffee chain in many cities, but this is no longer the case as the local competition already outpaced Starbucks in their expansion,” Yu told Al Jazeera.\n\nTop competitors include homegrown Luckin Coffee, which has more than 26,000 locations worldwide, mostly in China.\n\nStarbucks has historically been concentrated in first- and second-tier cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen while Luckin has expanded into much smaller cities.\n\nLuckin has also built a reputation around offering customers much cheaper drinks than Starbucks through its loyalty programme and in-app discounts.\n\nA small Americano coffee at Starbucks costs 30 yuan ($4.21), but at Luckin, the same drink retails on average for about 10 yuan ($1.40), according to Yu.\n\nOlivia Plotnick, founder of the Shanghai-based social marketing company Wai Social, told Al Jazeera that Starbucks has been unable to keep up with competitive pricing and consumer preferences.\n\n“Between domestic players such as Luckin and later Cotti Coffee undercutting Starbucks on price, footprint and flavour fuelled by tech, wider beverage competition from the rise of milk tea brands and delivery platform wars, Starbucks have lost their once very competitive edge,” Plotnick said. By “delivery platform wars”, Plotnick referred to the cutthroat competition between apps for delivery services that drives down prices of goods like coffee.\n\nStarbucks’s joint venture with Boyu Capital will offer the company more capital for investment but also help with logistics, infrastructure and managing commercial property as it opens more storefronts in regional cities, Yu said.\n\nThe company is following a familiar playbook used by other international brands in China, he said.\n\nIn 2016, after a major food safety scandal, KFC and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands sold a stake in their China business to the China-based Primavera Capital and an affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, according to Reuters. The China business was later spun off into an independent entity.\n\nIn 2017, McDonald’s sold off a majority stake in its China, Hong Kong and Macau businesses to the Chinese state-backed conglomerate CITIC and the private equity group Carlyle Capital although it later bought back some of its business, according to CNBC.\n\nAfter the deal with CITIC, McDonald’s doubled its outlets in China to 5,500 as of late 2023, CNBC said, and aims to open 10,000 restaurants by 2028."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/4/live-joy-in-gaza-as-palestinians-freed-by-israel-reunite-with-families?update=4082564","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Thousands in ‘overcrowded shelters’ amid continued Israeli shelling on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of people in Gaza are living in overcrowded shelters amid continuous Israeli artillery shelling, particularly in southern Gaza and eastern parts of Gaza City, where homes and farms are being destroyed.

2025-11-04T08:28:33+00:00\n\nTitle: A look inside Egypt’s newly unveiled Grand Egyptian Museum\n\nAfter two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday.\n\nRegarded as the world’s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo.\n\nThe complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt.\n\nSome of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun’s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza.\n\nThe museum has been called the “fourth pyramid” of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure).\n\nVisitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum’s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure.\n\nThe design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum’s main facade is made of frosted glass panels.\n\nThe complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024.\n\nThe museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre.\n\nUpon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes.\n\nFrom 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo’s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures.\n\nBeyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts.\n\nThe museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief).\n\nAmong the museum’s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago.\n\nDespite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor.\n\nVisitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber.\n\nThe Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area.\n\nThe Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres).\n\nTourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to official figures."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067291","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"There is no content available to extract key elements from, as the article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' has been closed and no details are provided in the text.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067258","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the Century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses Hurricane Melissa, referred to as the 'Storm of the Century,' making landfall in Jamaica, but contains no verifiable named entities or detailed information to support a summary.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, dubbed the 'Storm of the century,' made landfall in Jamaica, prompting urgent updates and raising global awareness about the severity of extreme weather events and their impact on vulnerable island nations.","keyTakeAways":["The article discusses Hurricane Melissa, referred to as the 'Storm of the century,' making landfall in Jamaica.","Hurricane Melissa is described as a major tropical storm with significant impact, indicating its relevance to global climate and disaster preparedness discussions."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Hurricane Melissa","whatIsThisEntity":"A major tropical storm","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Hurricane Melissa is the central event of the article, described as the 'Storm of the century,' making landfall in Jamaica and triggering widespread concern and updates."},{"name":"Jamaica","whatIsThisEntity":"A Caribbean island nation","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Jamaica is the location where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, making it directly relevant to the impact and response efforts described in the article."}],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Hurricane","Jamaica","Tropical Storm","Disaster","Climate Emergency"],"content":"Published: 2025-10-28T07:34:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica\n\nThis live page has now been closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/4/live-joy-in-gaza-as-palestinians-freed-by-israel-reunite-with-families?update=4082596","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Thousands in ‘overcrowded shelters’ amid continued Israeli shelling on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of civilians in Gaza are living in overcrowded shelters amid continuous Israeli artillery shelling, particularly in southern Gaza and eastern parts of Gaza City, where farms and houses are being destroyed.

Italy after rescue from partially collapsed medieval tower\n\nA Romanian worker who was pulled from the rubble of a medieval tower that partially collapsed in the Italian capital, Rome, has died in hospital, according to officials.\n\nOctay Stroici, who had remained conscious during the long rescue operation, was taken to Umberto I Hospital in serious condition late on Monday and was pronounced dead hours later.\n\n“Resuscitation attempts were made for about an hour to save Octay Stroici,” Italian news agency ANSA said, citing the Umberto I hospital.\n\n“Despite this, spontaneous cardiac activity could not be restored”, and his “death was pronounced at 12:20am” on Tuesday (23:20 GMT).\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was quick to offer her condolences.\n\n“I express deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss of Octay Stroici, the worker who was killed in the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome,” she said in a statement. “​We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering.”\n\nStroici had been helping to renovate the 29-metre (95-foot) Torre dei Conti, which partially collapsed shortly before midday on Monday, sending rubble into the street and a thick white cloud of dust into the air.\n\nThe collapse trapped Stroici, and rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use aerial ladders and a first-floor window to get near him. But they were forced to retreat after a second collapse took place 90 minutes later.\n\nAnother approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone was sent up instead.\n\nAs dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.\n\n“The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed, there was additional rubble that covered it,” Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters.\n\nThree workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalised in critical condition, with state television RAI reporting that he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.\n\nNo firefighters were injured in the operation.\n\nThe Torre dei Conti is in a busy area, just off the Imperial Forum and close to the Colosseum, Italy’s top tourist site. It was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family.\n\nThe tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.\n\nThe structure, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8m) restoration, which includes conservations work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems, and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.\n\nBefore the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out “to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary” to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said.\n\nThe current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.\n\nIn a separate development, the Italian government summoned Russia’s ambassador after the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman made a link between the accident and Italy’s support for Ukraine.\n\n“As long as the Italian government keeps uselessly wasting taxpayers’ money, all of Italy will collapse, from the economy to its towers,” said the spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, on Telegram.\n\nItaly’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, slammed Zakharova’s remarks as “shameful” and “unacceptable”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/4/live-joy-in-gaza-as-palestinians-freed-by-israel-reunite-with-families?update=4082558","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Thousands in ‘overcrowded shelters’ amid continued Israeli shelling on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ongoing Israeli artillery shelling in southern Gaza, coupled with destruction of homes and farms in eastern Gaza City, has left thousands of Palestinians in overcrowded shelters.

City –  For Zohran Mamdani, it starts and ends in Astoria, the Queens neighbourhood he has represented as a state assemblyman for five years, and where he made his first public address following a shock victory in the June Democratic primary for mayor.\n\nOn Monday, the 34-year-old made his final appearance before Tuesday’s election day, standing at a playground at dusk, with children laughing in the background.\n\nHis message to his  army of volunteers , which the campaign has said is made up of more than 100,000: “Leave everything out there on the field”.\n\n“These are the hands that have brought us to this point of making history in this city”, he said, “making history to show that when you focus and fight for working people, you can, in fact, remake the politics of the place that you call home”.\n\nWhile US President Donald Trump may have gained from deep disquiet over an affordability crisis in the country to win the 2024 presidential vote, Mamdani has argued that it is he and his mayoral campaign that can actually address those challenges in the biggest city of the United States.\n\nIndeed, Trump loomed large on Monday as Mamdani stood before a cadre of cheering canvassers, some clad in the campaign’s ubiquitous yellow beanies, and an equally large horde of local, national and international media.\n\nJust hours earlier, the US president had  explicitly endorsed  former Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying New Yorkers must choose the “bad democrat” over the “communist”, a false label he has repeatedly applied to democratic socialist Mamdani.\n\nSoon after, billionaire Elon Musk also threw his support behind Cuomo, a Democrat who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic Party’s primary.\n\nThe most recent polls showed Mamdani maintaining a commanding, if shrinking, lead over Cuomo. The late endorsements for the former governor, who has  explicitly called  on conservatives to jump ship from Republican candidate  Curtis Sliwa  and support him instead, could also further destabilise an already volatile race.\n\nStill, Mamdani’s supporters on Monday said they hoped their candidate’s speech will be a coda on a campaign that has been widely  considered as a rebuke  to the entrenched, donor-dominated Democratic establishment that Cuomo is seen to represent.\n\n“I feel amazing right now,” said Tasnuva Khan, who was among the canvassers on Monday, adding that the race had revealed both the  power of Muslim voters  and the city’s fast-growing Bangladeshi community.\n\nMamdani would be the first Muslim, first person of South Asian descent, and the first person born in Africa to lead the city, if he wins.\n\n“But I’m trying to stay balanced. What wins elections are votes. As long as we kind of stay focused and reach out to our community members, keep canvassing, knocking on doors, then I think we can definitely deliver,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut Shabnam Salehezadehi, a dentist from Long Island City, Queens, and a Mamdani supporter, said she feared the mayoral candidate’s real challenges would begin after the election.\n\nWinning is just the bare minimum, she noted, but for Mamdani to enact many of his  sweeping pledges  – free buses, universal childcare, rent freezes for a large portion of city apartments, paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy – he must win buy-in from a coalition of both state and city lawmakers.\n\n“I’m really anxious – not so much whether he’ll win or not,” said Salehezadehi, who added she was first drawn to Mamdani for his staunch support of Palestinian rights, a break from the traditional Democratic mainstream.\n\n“I just really hope we have the mandate to show that Zohran Mamdani is the candidate the city vehemently voted for,” she said.\n\nCuomo also spent the final day of the race cutting across the city, visiting the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nIn the Fordham neighbourhood of the Bronx, a community representative of some of the minority-dominated working-class areas Cuomo carried in the primary, the former governor stood on a park bench overlooking nearby street vendors.\n\nHe decried the “socialist city” New York would become if Mamdani were to win.\n\n“Socialism did not work in Venezuela. Socialism did not work in Cuba. Socialism will not work in New York City,” he said, in what has become a mantra in the final days of the race.\n\nAt a subsequent stop in Washington Heights, Manhattan, he replied to a question about the nod from Trump, which comes as Cuomo has already faced scrutiny for sharing many of the same billionaire donors as the Republican president.\n\n“He called me a bad Democrat. First of all, I happen to be a good Democrat and a proud Democrat, and I’m going to stay a proud Democrat. Mamdani is not a communist,” Cuomo said. “He’s a socialist. But we don’t need a socialist mayor either.”\n\nBut for Gwendolyn Paige, a 69-year-old special educator from the Bronx, the “socialist label” is not what’s deterring her from voting for Mamdani.\n\nInstead, she pointed to the Cuomo legacy. Cuomo’s father, Mario Cuomo, had also served as governor of the state. The younger Cuomo left his post in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations.\n\n“Cuomo is the only person who will stand up to the Trump administration,” Paige told Al Jazeera from the Fordham neighbourhood, even as she dismissed Trump’s endorsement.\n\n“Listen, tomorrow, Trump will say something else,” she said. “So, I don’t put much stock in it”.\n\nAt least 735,000 voters have already cast their ballots in early voting, just a portion of the 4.7 million registered voters in the city.\n\nPolls will be open from 6am to 9pm on Tuesday (11:00 GMT, Tuesday to 02:00 GMT, Wednesday), with a winner expected to emerge in the hours after. The victor will take office in January.\n\nWith just hours until election day, some votes are still up for grabs.\n\nLisa Gonzalez, a retired Army veteran, pointed to dire times for low-income residents of the US, including restrictions on food assistance benefits (SNAP) included in a bill passed by Trump and Republicans earlier this year.\n\nTrump has further threatened to cut federal funding for New York City and deploy the National Guard if Mamdani is elected.\n\n“I’m still deciding. The stakes feel really high,” she said. “So I’m just gonna be very careful tomorrow when I vote”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"3135-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of critical developments in science and technology, including Amazon’s recent workforce cuts and AWS outage, the UK’s emerging role as an AI hub, China’s export ban on Nexperia products affecting car manufacturing, climate-driven changes like mosquitoes in Iceland, Pakistan’s HPV vaccine rollout, growing concerns about AI spreading misinformation, and policy shifts such as the US scrapping EV tax incentives.

2025-11-04T09:30:53.340+00:00\n\nTitle: Trump backs Cuomo for New York City mayor and threatens to cut funding if Mamdani wins\n\nUS President Donald Trump has endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayor's race, urging voters not to elect left-wing front-runner Zohran Mamdani.\n\n\"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday evening. \"He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"\n\nThe president earlier said   he would be reluctant to send more than \"the very minimum\" level of federal funding to his hometown of New York if Mamdani was elected.\n\nThis echoed comments he made in a television interview on Sunday, during which he referred to Mamdani as a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.\n\n\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,\" Trump said in the interview. \"Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there\".\n\nResponding to Trump's comments about funding, Mamdani said he would \"address that threat for what it is: it is a threat. It is not the law.\"\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, and has rejected accusations he is a communist, joking in one television interview that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician\", only browner.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly tried to cut federal grants and funding for projects primarily located in Democratic-run areas. New York City received $7.4bn (£5.7bn) in federal funding this fiscal year.\n\nIndependent candidate Cuomo, a long-term Trump critic who was formerly a Democratic governor for New York state, responded to the tepid backing from the president: \"He's not endorsing me. He's opposing Mamdani.\"\n\nOpinion polls suggest Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, is ahead of Cuomo, who is running as an Independent after Mamdani bested him in the Democratic primary. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, trails behind.\n\nTrump, also a Republican, declined to endorse Sliwa in Monday's social media post, saying: \"A vote for Curtis Sliwa ... is a vote for Mamdani.\"\n\nMamdani said that \"the MAGA movement's embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump's understanding that this would be the best mayor for him\".\n\n\"Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,\" Mamdani said.\n\nIn his wide-ranging interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Mamdani in office would make left-wing former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \"look great\".\n\n\"I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far,\" the president said.\n\nTrump grew up in the New York borough of Queens and still owns property in the city.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\" the Republican president told CBS.\n\nIf Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years.\n\nThe 34-year-old state assemblyman has called Cuomo, the former New York governor, a puppet and parrot of Trump.\n\n\"The answer to a Donald Trump presidency is not to create its mirror image here in City Hall,\" Mamdani said on Monday.\n\n\"It is to create an alternative that can speak to what New Yorkers are so desperate to see in their own city and what they find in themselves and their neighbours every day - a city that believes in the dignity of everyone who calls this place home.\"\n\nCuomo has sought to parry that line of attack by presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the Trump administration.\n\nHe was governor of New York state during the Covid-19 pandemic when many states clashed with the Trump administration, though Cuomo himself came under scrutiny after state investigators found nursing home deaths were significantly understated during the outbreak.\n\n\"I fought Donald Trump,\" Cuomo said during a recent debate ahead of the mayoral vote. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"\n\nTrump has deployed National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of a crime crackdown, while seeking to strip funding from jurisdictions that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ken44n0eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:56:17.769+00:00","title":"Tommy Robinson not guilty of terror offence after not giving police access to phone","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was acquitted of a terror offence after refusing to provide police access to his iPhone during a stop at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone on 28 July 2024.

things to watch in US elections\n\nIt's election day in the US.\n\nPolls have opened in New York, Virginia and New Jersey, while California polling centres will open later.\n\nThis so-called \"off year\" election doesn't feature presidential or congressional races, but there are still several critical votes to watch tonight.\n\nNew York City will choose its next mayor, in a battle that has pitted a younger, progressive Democrat against a member of the party's old guard.\n\nThe states of Virginia and New Jersey will elect new governors, and the outcome of these contests could be bellwethers for next year's congressional midterm elections.\n\nCalifornians also will decide whether to redraw their US House district maps in a rare mid-decade redistricting, as Democrats try to counter Republicans' efforts to give their party an advantage in next year's midterm elections.\n\nHere are five things to watch.\n\nAll eyes will be on the Big Apple as Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman, attempts a political upset in his bid to become New York City's youngest mayor in over a century.\n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist,  shocked the political establishment  when he bested former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this summer. Cuomo, undeterred, has continued to campaign as an independent. Meanwhile, Republican Curtis Sliwa has resisted pressure to drop out of the race to clear a path for Cuomo.\n\nIf Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor. Democrats around the country will be watching to see if his laser-focus on cost-of-living issues like rent, groceries and wages could serve as effective messaging in future races.\n\nThough Mamdani heads into election night with a suggested polling lead, the gap between him and Cuomo has narrowed. In the final stretch of the campaign, Cuomo has hammered Mamdani on crime and public safety, and said the young politician lacks the experience to lead America's biggest city.\n\nCalifornia's Democratic leadership is asking voters for permission to redraw the state's congressional districts in the middle of the decade. That's unusual in California, which by law relies on a nonpartisan committee to draw its congressional maps once every decade, based on census data.\n\nHowever, as Republican-led states like Texas and Missouri seek to hastily redraw their congressional maps to give their party an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections, California Governor Gavin Newsom  wants to counter the losses with redistricting  in his own state.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 would allow the temporary use of new congressional district maps through 2030. The campaign has drawn $158 million in donations, according to the Los Angeles Times, with Democratic proponents vastly outraising the Republican opposition effort.\n\nRepublicans in California, who hold only nine of the state's 52 US House seats, staunchly oppose the plan.\n\nA University of California Berkeley/IGS poll suggests 60% of likely California voters support Proposition 50, while 38% oppose it. The breakdown was highly partisan, with 93% of Democrats saying they would choose \"yes\" and 91% of Republicans choosing \"no\".\n\nNew Jersey is considered a Democratic state, but polls indicate a close race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.  It's one of the two governor's races this year that could indicate how Americans feel about the current political climate.\n\nSherrill currently represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, and Ciattarelli is a former state assemblyman.\n\nDespite leaning blue, the state has had Republican governors in the past. The last one, Chris Christie, served two terms between 2010 and 2018.\n\nRhetoric in the race has been heated. Ciattarelli and his supporters have run political advertisements featuring clips of Sherrill giving halting answers in interviews about her policies.\n\nIt also has drawn the attention of nationally known names from both parties. Democratic stars like former president Barack Obama and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg have campaigned with Sherrill. President Donald Trump attended a virtual rally for Ciattarelli, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec has backed him.\n\nVirginia's leadership usually swings between Democrats and Republicans, meaning the outcome of this year's gubernatorial election might serve as a bellwether for the electorate's mood.\n\nNo matter which candidate succeeds, the state will elect its first female governor this year. Voters will choose between Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a US congresswoman, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor.\n\nIf Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first black woman elected to lead a US state in the nation's history.\n\nVirginia is bordered by the liberal-leaning Washington DC to the north, where many residents work in the nation's capitol or for the federal government. But the state also has deep pockets of conservative voters throughout its rural districts, and swing voters.\n\nSpanberger has highlighted the economic impact of Trump's cuts to the federal government, which have impacted Virginia's employment. Earle-Sears has touted Virginia's economy under Republican leadership. But she also has leaned into cultural topics like transgender issues, which Republicans used successfully as a wedge issue in last year's presidential election.\n\nThough he's not on the ballot, Trump's name looms over this election.\n\nThe New York City mayor's race is how the next leader of the city will deal with the Trump administration, which has meddled in the city's politics. Cuomo is pitching his experience as governor dealing with the first administration as a reason for voters to choose him.\n\nThe president has implied that he will penalize the city if voters choose Mamdani.\n\n\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York, because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,\"  Trump said  in an interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes that aired Sunday. Mamdani rejects the communist label.\n\nTrump kicked off the redistricting battle that led California to put Proposition 50 on the ballot, and has endorsed Ciattarelli in the New Jersey governor's race."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrg70pj1mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"03:16:18.483+00:00","title":"Shein bans all sex dolls after outrage over childlike products","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shein, a global fast-fashion retail platform based in Singapore, has banned all sales of sex dolls worldwide after facing widespread criticism and regulatory action from France.

her law exams, but she says practising divorce law is not in her future.\n\nThe 45-year-old, who plays divorce attorney Allura Grant in the Disney+ upcoming legal drama All's Fair, tells the BBC she's \"more into criminal justice and reform work\" and adds, \"I don't think I can ever really do family law\".\n\nKardashian has been studying to become a lawyer for the last six years, undertaking an apprenticeship that negates the need for a university degree.\n\n\"It was the wildest idea that I was going to law school - but to me it all makes sense and I hope that I'm forever curious and always want to try new things,\" she says.\n\nKardashian, who has four children with ex-husband Kanye West, also runs fashion and shapewear brand SKIMS and appears in the reality series The Kardashians with her family.\n\nHer interest in criminal justice has been documented on her reality TV shows, where she has advocated for prison reform in the US and sentence reduction for first-time offenders.\n\nNot content with her already packed-out schedule, her recent pivot to acting has raised eyebrows - but it hasn't dented Kardashian's ambition.\n\n\"I guess I just don't live in those expectation boxes,\" she says.\n\nShe says she \"loves taking on constructive criticism\" but doesn't understand why people think she \"can't do something that you want to do or are curious or want to learn about\".\n\nHer first real introduction to acting was her 2023 casting in the 12th season of American Horror Story, in which she appeared as a publicist.\n\nKardashian received mostly positive critical reviews for her portrayal, which encouraged her to take on more acting roles.\n\nAll's Fair reunites the star with American Horror Story showrunner Ryan Murphy, who is also behind hit series such as Glee and Pose.\n\nHis latest project, All's Fair, is a legal drama set in the US, which sees Kardashian play a divorce lawyer alongside Sarah Paulson, Naomi Watts, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash and Teyana Taylor.\n\nKardashian says her priority was to \"come in prepared\" to set, adding she would spend every day \"watching and learning from these women\", who she called \"the best acting coaches in the world\".\n\nShe adds that there was a lot of pressure on her, because those behind the show were \"taking a chance on working with me\".\n\n\"The last thing I would want to do is be unprofessional, be late or not know my lines,\" she says.\n\nAll's Fair, which Disney+ says holds the records for their most-watched trailer of all time, is a spectacular dramatisation of the lives of lawyers tasked with navigating divorce for rich and famous female clients.\n\nKardashian says divorce is \"such a relatable topic\" after experiencing it \"with my family and parents growing up\".\n\nKardashian herself has been divorced three times - most recently to Kanye West in 2022 after eight years of marriage.\n\nWhilst she says the stories of the women in the show \"are not based on anything I've been through\", she was \"definitely inspired\" by practising to be a lawyer.\n\nKardashian's co-star Watts also recognises that, whilst the show might be sensationalised, the story of \"women who feel like they're finished, [their lives] are all over, broken and in pieces\" at the end of a relationship is one that is familiar for many.\n\nNash, who stars as a legal investigator in the show, says that divorce is something many \"have in common with other women and celebrities\" and thinks the show is so appealing due to its relatability, even if it's more dramatic way than real life.\n\nPaulson adds says that although the central theme of the show may be divorce, \"conflict and resolution is a beautiful part of the show\", which also \"tackles big, important and emotional relationships\".\n\nMuch of the talk around the show has been about the strength of the all-female cast, which is filled with some of Hollywood's biggest names.\n\nThe cast all echo that it was Ryan Murphy - who has won six Emmy awards, a Tony award and two Grammy awards in his 25-year career in television, film and theatre - that convinced them to sign up.\n\n\"He [Murphy] calls and I don't tend to say no to him,\" Paulson jokes.\n\nPaulson is perhaps one of Murphy's greatest collaborators, having appeared in nine series of American Horror Story between 2011 and 2021.\n\nKardashian says the cast all went into the project \"blindly\" but it was great to see Murphy's \"magic come to life\".\n\n\"Ryan was really intentional in that way, he really loves to uplift women and make these female-led casts, which is super empowering. He wrote it that way, he saw it no other way,\" she adds.\n\nWatts also agrees, noting that the writer and producer \"manages to identify spaces that haven't necessarily been visited before\".\n\n\"He's wonderful at creating stories for women of a certain age and for me that's where I am at in my life.\n\n\"These women all get to do these incredible things together - we're such a different group - different ages and everything and we're supporting each other through the story,\" Watts adds.\n\nMurphy received a five-year developmental deal with Netflix in 2018, which was reportedly worth $300m (£228m).\n\nDuring that time he made two true crime series for the streaming service - Dahmer- Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, plus drama series The Politician.\n\nMurphy now has a new deal with Disney+, which includes All's Fair.\n\nHe serves as executive producer on the show alongside Kardashian, Close, Paulson, Watts and Nash.\n\nKris Jenner, Kardashian's mother and manager, also receives a director credit."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylxv52pdeo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"22:12:07.267+00:00","title":"Prince William in Rio at start of Brazil visit for COP30 and Earthshot Prize","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince William begins a five-day visit to Brazil, marking his first international appearance at a COP summit, to present the Earthshot Prize and deliver a speech at COP30 in Belem.

to Rio de Janeiro as he began a five-day visit to Brazil.\n\nPrince William was on the city's Sugarloaf Mountain, with a bird's eye view of the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue, as he received the honour from the city's mayor, Eduardo Paes.\n\nThe prince had travelled to the top of the mountain by cable car, to the surprise of several groups of tourists queuing to travel up the mountain. As he came down again, he posed for selfies with several of the people who had waited to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nHe is visiting Brazil for the first time with two key environmental missions. On Wednesday he is presenting the Earthshot Prize, the annual award from the charity he set up himself.\n\nThe following day he will travel to Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, where he is scheduled to deliver a speech as part of COP30, the annual UN climate meeting where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for further climate change.\n\nIt is the first time that Prince William has travelled internationally for a COP summit, as his father, King Charles, has previously led the way for the royals, making several keynote speeches to world leaders over the years.\n\nPrince William did attend, along with his father, when it was held in Glasgow 2021, two weeks after the first Earthshot Prize.\n\nThe prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories for projects that aim to repair the world's climate  - and Prince William has committed himself to it for10 years, with Rio marking a halfway point for the venture.\n\nThis year's shortlist  includes an upcycled skyscraper in Sydney, the entire island of Barbados and a Bristol based company that filters microplastics from washing machines.\n\nWhen he announced the nominees, the prince spoke of the optimism and courage he was looking for.\n\n\"The people behind these projects are heroes of our time, so let us back them. Because, if we do, we can make the world cleaner, safer and full of opportunity - not only for future generations, but for the lives we want to lead now.\"\n\nAfter the ceremony, Mayor Paes said Prince William has been \"amazed with the beauty of the city\" and he joked: \"So he's got the keys, he can do whatever he wants in the next 72 hours. The city belongs to Prince William. I'm still the king, but it will belong to him!\"\n\nPrince William's visit to Rio de Janeiro is the most significant royal engagement he will make this year and also mark the first time he will be seen representing the Royal Family since the crisis surrounding his uncle Andrew.\n\nThere has been speculation that Prince William was heavily involved in the King's announcement last week to sanction Andrew by removing his remaining titles and asking him to leave his home in Windsor - but those close to the situation say that was not the case.\n\nAlthough William would have had a powerful, influential voice as the future monarch, the decision was ultimately the King's working with his private team of advisers and in conjunction with the government.\n\nThe visit to Brazil will include the two key environment-based events but will also allow him to take in some of Rio's other famous sights.\n\nAs an avid football fan and Patron of the English Football Association, it was no surprise that a pilgrimage was arranged on his first day to the Maracana Stadium, the stage of some of the football-mad nation's most famous moments.\n\nOnce there, he was greeted by the player who wore the yellow and green kit more than any other, Brazil's most capped-star Cafu, who presented him with a signed number 2 Brazil shirt.\n\nThe legendary right back, who is the  only player in history to appear in three World Cup finals , then joined Prince William in leading training drills involving local children.\n\nThe royal, who had handily arrived wearing a smart pair of white trainers, did not need a second invitation to get out on one of the world's most famous football's pitches.\n\nOne of the more unusual training techniques saw him playing in a game with a group of young girls in which all the players had to compete while carrying a cup of water - in order to improve their balance.\n\nAnd the prince then found himself under a peculiarly English pressure near the end of the session when he was required to take a penalty - a task that has seen many an Englishman fail in the biggest of tournament moments.\n\nBut there were no worries for Prince William as he duly slotted his spot kick past 14-year-old goalkeeper Pedro Enrique and was then mobbed by his team-mates who all wanted a celebratory high-five.\n\nYoung Pedro said he had been \"scared and nervous\" to be facing one of the most famous men in the world but said: \"I didn't let him score. It was a good penalty.\"\n\nAnd the sporting activity did not stop there - Prince William later went to Copacabana Beach, where he played beach volleyball with Brazil international Carolina Solberg."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7e2vgmxv8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:38:51.812+00:00","title":"Canada's Mark Carney promises 'bold' first federal budget","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney is unveiling his first federal budget, promising bold economic reforms to reduce dependence on US trade amid rising tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

federal budget on Tuesday, and has warned Canadians to expect \"sacrifices\" as he aims to transform an economy battered by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nCarney has said the spending plan will see both significant cuts and \"generational investments\" to strengthen the economy and reduce the country's reliance on US trade.\n\nThe plan is also expected to lay out how Canada will pay for billions of dollars in defence spending to fulfil the new Nato commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence by 2035.\n\nAnalysts have suggested the federal deficit could exceed C$70bn ($50bn; £38bn), up from $51.7bn last year.\n\nThe fiscal plan is seen as a major test for Carney, a former central banker for Canada and the UK who has promised to make Canada's economy the strongest in the G7 group of wealthy nations.\n\n\"We used to take big, bold risks in this country. It is time to swing for the fences again,\" he said in a pre-budget speech last month.\n\nCanada, which trades primarily with the US, has a particular exposure to tariff shocks.\n\nCarney has said he is setting a goal for the country to double its non-US exports in the next decade.\n\nJoy Nott, a partner at KPMG Canada who focuses on trade and customs, told the BBC that \"Canadian companies need government support during the transition of moving from one market to another\".\n\nThat includes everything from finding money to travel on trade missions abroad to market research and navigating regulatory approvals when entering new markets.\n\nIt takes time and money to overcome \"those historic hurdles that we've seen, that prevented them from doing it\", Ms Nott said.\n\nFinance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne underscored the \"made-at-home\" message on Monday as he bought new shoes - a political pre-budget tradition for federal finance ministers - at a Quebec business that supplies footwear worldwide as well as to Canada's armed forces and RCMP officers.\n\nThe firm was \"emblematic of who we are as a nation\", he told reporters as he stood in the company's manufacturing facility.\n\n\"We're moving from reliance to resilience, from uncertainty to prosperity, we're going to do the kind of things that make this country stronger,\" Champagne said.\n\nWhile he said the budget would be focused on \"investments\", Carney has also promised to balance the federal operating budget - day-to-day spending on government programmes - over the next three years.\n\nOver the summer, federal ministries were asked to find ways to cut up to 15% from programme spending in the coming years, as the government seeks savings to fund spending into things like trade infrastructure, housing, and tariff-impacted industries.\n\nIt is still unclear where the Carney's Liberal Party will find the support they need to pass the spending package. The Liberals, who are three seats short of a majority in the House of Commons, need at least one other party to help pass the fiscal plan.\n\nCanada faces a potential snap election if the budget vote, which is a confidence vote, fails. Though that is an unlikely scenario so soon after Canadians went to the ballot box in the spring.\n\n\"I don't think any of the other parties want to run an election right now,\" said Elizabeth McCallion, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.\n\nThe most likely support would come from the left-wing NDP, who are currently in the midst of a leadership race after a devastating election performance in April.\n\nProf McCallion said it was possible some NDP members of Parliament would abstain from voting to allow the budget to pass.\n\nShe said Carney also faced the risk of \"push back against austerity\" measures expected in the budget.\n\nTrump has imposed a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, although most goods are exempt from the levies because they fall under a US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal. However, separate global US tariffs on metals, autos, and lumber are hitting those sectors in the country  particularly hard.\n\nThere are signs the trade uncertainty is weighing on Canada's economy and unemployment is on the rise.\n\nThe Bank of Canada projects the country's GDP will grow by 1.2% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026 and 1.6% in 2027."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51l324p7lo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"00:14:57.443+00:00","title":"Rare footage reveals survival secrets of Africa's top predators","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC documentary series 'Kingdom' reveals rare and previously unseen behaviors among Africa's top predators in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, including hyenas stealing food and hiding it underwater, wild dogs rescuing a member from a crocodile, and the birth of lion cubs.

food from wild dogs and outsmarting rivals by hiding a stolen carcass underwater to mask its scent.\n\nThis is just some of the remarkable animal behaviour on display in the  new BBC wildlife documentary series, Kingdom , which follows the lives of four rival carnivore families over five years.\n\n​​The scenes include poignant moments as the animals face threats from snare trappings to brutal ambushes and violent territorial battles.\n\n\"We could never have written a script like this, only nature could write this script,\" said executive producer Mike Gunton.\n\n​​Behind the scenes, the Zambia Carnivore Programme works to protect these animals.\n\n​​The team followed four animal families - leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions - in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, capturing rare moments and revealing the intricate dynamics of life in one of Africa's wildest regions.\n\nViewers will watch five-day-old lion cubs opening their eyes, alongside dramatic scenes shown in Kingdom for the first time, such as a pack of wild dogs rescuing one of their own from the jaws of a crocodile.\n\nOther wild animals like elephants and baboons also feature in the new series, which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough.\n\n​\"Everything about these species has been shaped by millions of years of competition alongside each other,\" said series producer Felicity Lanchester. \"Now…humans are changing that,\" she added.\n\nFilmmakers and scientific researchers in the region have collaborated behind the scenes as the footage is a valuable source of data, informing conservation strategies.\n\n​​\"We got a lot of information that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise... on topography, diet, movement, births, and deaths,” said Dr Matthew Becker, scientific consultant for the series and CEO of the Zambia Carnivore Programme.\n\nThe greatest threat these large carnivores face is habitat loss, while snaring and a declining prey base also play a role. Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.\n\nThese pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.\n\n​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.\n\n​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.\n\nReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"\n\n​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers.\n\nThe external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.\n\nSpeaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"\n\nKingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:18:45.783+00:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani - from rank outsider to possibly being New York's next mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old housing counselor and New York State assemblyman, has emerged as a frontrunner for mayor of New York City, becoming the youngest mayor in over a century and the city’s first Muslim and South Asian leader.

Mamdani walked the streets of the Upper East Side for a campaign event to greet early voters, he could barely walk a few steps without being stopped by his supporters.\n\nTwo smiling young women looked starstruck and told him they followed him on Instagram. The millennial Democratic nominee for mayor thanked them before posing with another young man who had readied his phone for a selfie.\n\nThrongs of press surrounded Mamdani and captured his every moment, like running into the street to shake hands with a taxi driver shouting \"we support you, man\".\n\nWith a comfortable lead in the polls, the 34-year-old is on the brink of making history when New Yorkers vote on Tuesday, as the youngest mayor in over a century and the first Muslim and South Asian leader of the city.\n\nA relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to New York State assembleyman and frontrunner to lead the biggest city in the US, a job which comes with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.\n\nThrough viral videos and outreach to content creators and podcasters, Mamdani has reached disaffected voters at a time when faith in the Democratic party among its own members is at an all-time low.\n\nBut there are questions over whether he can deliver on his ambitious promises and how a politician with no executive experience will handle the onslaught sure to come from a hostile Trump administration.\n\nThere is also the complicated relationship he has with his party establishment, as he becomes a national figurehead for left-wing Democrats.\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, which has no clear definition but essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations. He has promised to tax millionaires to pay for expanded social programmes. It's the politics of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with whom Mamdani has often shared a stage.\n\nTrump has threatened to withdraw federal funds if New Yorkers elect a \"communist\".\n\nMamdani has refuted that common attack line about his politics and during a daytime television interview he agreed with the host that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician,\" only browner, he joked.\n\nVictory would be seen as a rejection of politics as usual by New Yorkers as they struggle with the cost of living - Mamdani's number one issue.\n\nHis main rival in Tuesday's vote is former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary.\n\nCuomo accuses Mamdani of an anti-business agenda that would kill New York. He says he has shown he can stand up to Trump but Mamdani calls Cuomo the president's puppet.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, mocks both of them. In the last debate, he said: \"Zohran, your resume could fit on a cocktail napkin. And Andrew, your failures could fill a public school library in New York City.\"\n\nMamdani's message has been laser-focused on affordability and quality of life issues. He has promised universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidised units, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.\n\nIt's a message that has landed with New Yorkers fed up with sky-high prices.\n\n\"I support him because I'm a housing attorney and I see how the cost of living just keeps going up and up and up,\" Miles Ashton told the BBC outside the candidates' debate earlier this month. \"We all want an affordable city.\"\n\nThe costs of the Mamdani agenda would be covered by new taxes on corporations and millionaires, which he insists would raise $9bn - though some, like the libertarian Cato Institute,  say his sums don't add up . He would also need the support of the state legislature and Governor Kathy Hochul to implement new taxes.\n\nShe has endorsed him but says she is against increased income taxes. She does, however, want to work with him to achieve universal child care, which is by far the biggest-ticket item on his agenda at $5bn.\n\nAs he rode the M57 bus across Manhattan to highlight his free buses plan, he told the BBC why his focus on affordability was the right approach in the Trump era.\n\n\"It's time for us to understand that to defend democracy, it's not just to stand up against an authoritarian administration. It is also to ensure that that democracy can deliver on the material needs of working class people right here. That's something we've failed to do in New York City.\"\n\nAmong New Yorkers who told the BBC they were not voting for Mamdani, doubts about him being able to pay for his agenda and his inexperience were two of the biggest factors.\n\nAfter Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, Wall Street leaders were hardly celebrating. Some threatened to leave the city.\n\nBut there's been a noticeable shift since then - the mood is less panic, more collaboration. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon even said he would offer his help if Mamdani is elected.\n\nReal estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who has met Mamdani, says he is too inexperienced to lead the nation's largest city. He thinks his rent freeze plan would hurt tenants and his taxes on wealthy people will drive high earners away.\n\nHe does, however, support Mamdani's universal childcare plan, a provision he gives his own staff at his casino upstate.\n\nPart of the change in tone since the primary has been down to a concerted effort on Mamdani's part to meet his critics.\n\nOn 14 October, Alexis Bittar, a self-taught jewellery designer who grew his business into a global company, hosted Mamdani and 40 business leaders at his 1850s Brooklyn townhouse.\n\nThey were a mix of CEOs and business owners from financial, fashion and art sectors. More than half were Jewish and they were all either on the fence or opposed to Mamdani's candidacy.\n\nThere were questions about business, his management experience and how he would finance his agenda.\n\n\"I think he came across great,\" Mr Bittar told the BBC. \"The thing that's remarkable about him is he's incredibly equipped to answer them - and diligently answer them.\"\n\nPart of Mamdani's engagement with his critics has been a willingness to change his position.\n\nIn 2020, after the murder of black man George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, Mamdani called for the city to defund police and called the NYPD \"racist\". But he has since apologised and says he no longer holds those views.\n\nCrime is the number one issue for Howard Wolfson, who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and is now a Democratic strategist. He was present during a meeting last month between the mayoral hopeful and Bloomberg, who spent $8m during the primary race trying to beat him.\n\nWolfson told the BBC he will judge Mamdani on how the city is policed.\n\n\"I think it's great that he reaches out and is engaged, but I'm much more interested in how he's going to govern,\" he said. \"Public safety is really the prerequisite for success or failure.\"\n\nMany see Mamdani's pledge to ask the police commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on as a way to allay concerns he would be soft on crime.\n\nHe says he would maintain the current level of NYPD staffing and create a new department of community safety that would deploy mental health care teams instead of armed officers to non-threatening, psychiatric calls.\n\nOne position Mamdani has stood firm on is his criticism of Israel and lifelong support for Palestinian rights.\n\nIt represents a break from the Democratic party establishment and could be a deciding factor for many voters in a city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.\n\nHe sparked outrage during the primary process when he refused to condemn the term \"globalise the intifada\". But after Jewish New Yorkers expressed their unease to him, telling him they felt unsafe on hearing it, he said he discouraged others from using it.\n\nA letter signed by more than 1,100 rabbis cited Mamdani as it condemned the \"political normalisation\" of anti-Zionism. Jewish voters are largely split between Mamdani and Cuomo in polling.\n\nBrad Lander, the city's comptroller, or financial chief, who teamed up with Mamdani in the Democratic primary to endorse each other's candidacy against Cuomo, says many Jewish New Yorkers like him are very enthusiastic about Mamdani.\n\nHe is a mayoral candidate deeply committed to keeping everyone safe, regardless of religious beliefs, Lander told the BBC.\n\nSumaiya Chowdhury and Farhana Islam of the group Muslims for Progress have canvassed for the mayoral hopeful.\n\nMs Islam said that, while they were all excited that he could be New York's first Muslim mayor, he didn't need to lean on his identity for support.\n\n\"His policies speak for themselves and they alone are enough to make him popular.\"\n\nSince his primary win, the Islamophobia Mamdani faces has increased. He now has police security and, last month, a Texas man was arrested on charges of making terroristic threats against him. In one message, the man said \"Muslims don't belong here\".\n\nMamdani decided to deliver an address on Islamophobia after Cuomo laughed along to a radio talkshow host saying that Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style attack.\n\nIn an emotional speech, he said he had hoped that by ignoring racist attacks and sticking to a central message, it would allow him to be more than just his faith. \"I was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\"\n\nWhat may propel Mamdani to victory in liberal New York may not be a recipe for success nationally. And Democrats in Congress seem worried about the implications of his ascendancy as party tensions between moderates and progressives persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had not endorsed Mamdani as of Tuesday morning, while his fellow New Yorker House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only endorsed him a few hours before early voting began.\n\nDemocratic strategists have said the problem posed by Mamdani for the party's establishment is that Trump and the Republicans already cast Democrats, no matter how moderate, as socialists. And it's a tactic that is thought to have landed with some effect among Cuban and Venezuelan voters in the 2024 election.\n\nJosh Gottheimer, the moderate Democratic representative of New Jersey,  told the Washington Post  he thought Mamdani had \"extremist views\" at odds with the Democratic party and that he feared Republicans will use the candidate as a kind of \"bogeyman\".\n\nAt a campaign event on the Upper East Side, Mamdani told the BBC how he plans to handle the intense scrutiny if he wins, pointing to the energy behind his candidacy.\n\n\"There is no doubt that there will be opposition as we see that opposition today, and what has allowed us to surmount the unbelievable amounts of money that has been spent against this campaign in the primary or the general, has been the mass movement that we have created.\"\n\nPaloma Nadera, 38, volunteering at the event, said the last time she had been this excited to vote had been for Barack Obama in 2008. Since then she's been disappointed by what she called the lack of bravery within the party.\n\n\"I feel like this race means so much to me because it's local. It's going to affect me, my family, my friends, everyone here in New York City.\n\n\"But it's also sort of sending a message, up the chain about what we want politics to start to look like on the Democratic side on a national level.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Grace Goodwin"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511811gqr0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:04:24.898+00:00","title":"Dick Cheney obituary: former Republican vice-president who helped lead US 'war on terror'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Vice President and architect of President George W.

W. Bush made him defence secretary during the first Gulf War and the US invasion of Panama.\n\nIn 2001, Cheney became one of the most powerful vice presidents in history.\n\nHe was a key architect of President George W. Bush's 'War on Terror' after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and an early advocate of the invasion of Iraq.\n\nBut, in his final years, he became a bitter critic of the Republican party under the leadership of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic,\" Cheney said.\n\nRichard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on 30 January 1941.\n\nHis father worked for the US Department of Agriculture, while his mother had been a successful softball player in the 1930s.\n\nWhen he was 13, his family moved to Casper, an oil town in Wyoming. In 1959, Cheney entered Yale on a scholarship, but failed to graduate.\n\nHe confessed that he fell in with “some kindred souls, young men like me who were not adjusting very well [to Yale] and shared my opinion that beer was one of the essentials of life.”\n\nHe went on to gain a Master's degree in political science from the University of Wyoming but - like his future boss, George W. Bush, he continued to party.\n\nIn his early 20s, Cheney was twice convicted of drink driving. The incidents focused his mind on the future.\n\n\"I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course,\" he said.\n\nIn 1959, when he became eligible to be drafted for military service, Cheney made the most of every legal avenue to avoid putting on a uniform.\n\nHe obtained a string of deferments, first so that he could finish his college course and then when his new wife, Lynne became pregnant.\n\n\"I don't regret the decisions I made,\" he said later. \"I complied fully with all the requirements of the statutes, registered with the draft when I turned 18. Had I been drafted, I would have been happy to serve.\"\n\nSurprisingly this did not become a major campaign issue when he was running for the Vice-Presidency, even after Cheney questioned the ability of the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry - himself a Vietnam veteran - to serve as commander in chief.\n\nDick Cheney's first taste of Washington came in 1968 when he worked for William Steiger, a young republican representative from Wisconsin.\n\nLegend has it that he caught the eye of Donald Rumsfeld, former defence secretary, then about to take over at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) under President Richard Nixon.\n\nRumsfeld mentored Cheney, first in the OEO, and then in the Ford White House.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford made Rumsfeld his defence secretary in 1975, Cheney found himself chief of staff at the White House. He was just 34 years old.\n\nEschewing the standard limousine for his battered VW Beetle, Dick Cheney proved a popular and approachable master of ceremonies.\n\n\"He made the system run,\" said Brent Scowcroft, Ford's national security adviser. \"Everybody had access to the president, but it was smooth, orderly. He didn't try to be a deputy president.\"\n\nWhen Ford lost the presidency in 1976, Cheney returned to Wyoming and stood for its House of Representatives seat.\n\nBut, weeks into the campaign and smoking three packets of cigarettes a day, he had the first of his many heart attacks.\n\nWhile he was recuperating, Lynne continued to campaign on his behalf - and Cheney was returned with an impressive 59% of the vote.\n\nDuring his decade in the House, he gained himself the reputation as a drier-than-dry conservative, enthusiastically supporting Ronald Reagan's huge Cold War increases in defence spending.\n\nMore controversially, he opposed the release of Nelson Mandela from jail and was one of only 21 congressmen to vote against the prohibition of armour-piercing \"cop killer\" bullets.\n\nEarly in 1989, he was given the chance of higher office when President George H. W.  Bush's nominee for defence secretary, Senator John Tower, was forced to withdraw amid allegations of heavy drinking and womanising.\n\nBush needed a congressman with a good reputation to take over at the Pentagon. He chose Dick Cheney and the Senate approved the choice without opposition.\n\nCheney's years at defence were some of the most momentous since the end of World War Two. The Berlin Wall and the Soviet empire collapsed and the United States was left to rethink its whole doctrine.\n\nAlthough hawkish by nature, he oversaw a huge post-Cold War reduction in the military budget - where the number of servicemen and women fell from 2.2 million to 1.8 million.\n\nMost of all, though, his time at the Pentagon will be remembered for the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq.\n\nHe took the lead in advocating military force against Saddam Hussein, whose troops had invaded Kuwait.\n\nHe persuaded Saudi Arabia's King Fahd to allow the deployment of more than 400,000 United States troops on his territory in the lead-up to Operation Desert Storm.\n\nDick Cheney flew to Riyadh to plan the attack with his generals. After a five week air campaign, coalition forces began a ground war.\n\nWithin 100 hours, Iraq's army had been routed.\n\nGenerals Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf received the ticker-tape parades. But Dick Cheney, as much as his soldiers, deserved credit for the success of Desert Storm.\n\nBill Clinton's presidential election victory in 1992 saw Cheney leave Washington once again.\n\nThis time he became CEO of Halliburton, a huge multinational company that is a leading supplier of equipment to the oil industry. There he remained, until summoned back to public life by George Bush Jnr.\n\nInitially, he was asked to chair the search for someone to be vice president. But, having reviewed his recommendations, the young presidential candidate asked Dick Cheney if he would join him on the ticket.\n\nAfter the attacks on 11 September 2001, Cheney was isolated from the president for a number of weeks - taken to an \"undisclosed location\" - in order to secure the succession if George W. Bush should be killed.\n\nHe was a leading advocate of US military action in both Afghanistan and Iraq. He insisted that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction, and saw his defeat as the finishing of old business.\n\nCheney was a strong supporter of waterboarding captured terrorist suspects, declaring himself to be a \"strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation techniques\".\n\nBut it was his close links to, and long experience in Congress which made him a new type of vice-president. Cheney kept offices in the Capitol building as well as near the commander-in-chief, so as to be at the heart of the legislative process.\n\nHe played an influential role in keeping Bush's tax policies conservative, and rolling back environmental protections that were hampering American businesses.\n\nCheney had the ear of the president at all times and was never slow in using his privileged access to by-pass other senior members of the administration.\n\nHe did so to some effect in 2001, when he persuaded Bush to sign an order stripping captured foreign terrorist suspects of their legal rights.\n\nThis was to the anger of the Secretary of State, Colin Powell who first heard about the decision when it was broadcast on the news channel, CNN.\n\nIn October 2002, and later in July 2007, while President Bush was undergoing medical procedures, Cheney became acting president for a few hours under the terms of the 25th Amendment.\n\nBut his inability to shepherd legislation through Congress brought accusations that Mr Cheney was a liability.\n\nAnd, even though George W Bush said that he would retain his running mate for 2004, there was pressure in Republican circles to dump him.\n\nThe president stood firm and Cheney played a central role in the decisive victory against John Kerry and his running mate John Edwards.\n\nThere was one exception to his conservatism which emerged during the campaign.\n\nHe opposed a constitutional ban on gay marriage - supported by President Bush - because his daughter Mary was a lesbian.\n\nCheney announced that - although the final decision should be left to individual states - he was personally in favour of marriage equality. \"Freedom means freedom for everyone,\" he said.\n\nHis reputation became damaged when it emerged that Halliburton had won the contract to restore Iraq's oil industry, and that he was to receive $500,000 in deferred compensation from the company.\n\nMore controversy was to follow. In 2005, his former chief of staff Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby was indicted on charges relating to the leaking of a CIA agent's identity to the press.\n\nAnd in 2006, after intense pressure from politicians and the media, Cheney was forced to take responsibility for accidentally shooting a hunting companion.\n\nHarry Whittington, 78, was left with 30 pellets in his body, leading to a minor heart attack. Mr Cheney later called the incident \"one of the worst days of my life\".\n\nThe unfortunate episode became fodder for US late-night comedians and was seized upon by opponents as a damaging political metaphor - showing Cheney  blasting away at the wrong target.\n\nThe vice president also grew worried that terrorists might try and assassinate him, by sending an electronic signal to his pacemaker - having seen a fictional version of this plot on the TV series, Homeland.\n\n\"I was aware of the danger that existed,\" he late wrote. \"I knew from the experience we had and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.\"\n\nThe pacemaker was taken out and replaced with one that had no connection to wifi.\n\nAfter eight-years as vice-president, the man widely seen as the architect of President Bush's \"war on terror\" left office in January 2009.\n\nHe became a critic of the Obama administration's national security policies, opposing plans to close the US detention centre in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nHe lashed out at his vice presidential successor, Joe Biden, calling him \"dead wrong\" for saying another attack on the scale of 11 September 2001 was unlikely.\n\nAfter a full heart transplant in 2012, he remained an active political figure. And, despite decades working for Republican presidents, he became a bitter opponent of President Donald Trump.\n\nHaving initially endorsed him in 2016, Cheney was appalled by allegations of Russian interference in the presidential election and Trump's seemingly casual attitude towards Nato.\n\nHe supported his older daughter, Liz, as she became a leading Republican 'never Trump' in the House of Representatives - and condemned the refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election.\n\nDick Cheney later  published a statement that he would vote for Kamala Harris  in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIt was an action that guaranteed that he will be remembered with mixed emotions on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nFor years, Cheney was a hero to the Republican right for his forthright manner and dry-as-dust ideological beliefs - and reviled by the left, who accused him of working for the interests of the oil industry.\n\nBut, he ended up supporting gay marriage and a Democratic party presidential candidate - while his frequent attacks on Donald Trump destroyed his relationship with his former party."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"22:46:25.268+00:00","title":"Why has the US government shut down and what does it mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government has shut down for the first time in nearly seven years due to a budget standoff between Republican and Democratic lawmakers, with the shutdown beginning on 1 October 2025 after Congress failed to pass a spending bill.

history"],"content":"Published: 2025-11-03T22:46:25.268+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has the US government shut down and what does it mean?\n\nThe US government shutdown continues, with Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress no closer to ending their budget standoff.\n\nIt means that many - but not all - US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this one is especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned to office in January, and has threatened to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October, when the previous federal budget expired.\n\nIn the US system, Congress must agree a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats want the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.\n\nDemocrats also oppose spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate.\n\nAnd so, at 00:01 EDT on 1 October (04:01 GMT), the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nEnding the shutdown requires the two parties in the Senate to find a compromise that Trump will sign. Several votes aimed at reopening the government have failed.\n\nRepublicans say they want to negotiate the health insurance subsidies separately, and only pass what they call a \"clean resolution\".  The Trump administration has been unwilling to offer substantive concessions and believes the Democrats will bear the brunt of the public's blame.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats believe their efforts to secure cheaper healthcare are popular with voters. There is also pressure on congressional leaders to hold firm from the party's left wing, which believes they folded too quickly during the budget dispute in March 2025.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual.\n\nHowever  many flights have been cancelled or delayed  because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave. That has affected ongoing research projects at agencies like the National Institutes of Health.  Contractors who are not directly employed by the government are missing out on work, too.\n\nUS troops were on track to miss their paycheck in mid-October until the Trump administration  identified funds to pay them . However, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this was a \"temporary fix\" and future payments may not be made.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has also run out. The 41 million people enrolled in the programme were warned in late October that they would . But on 3 November, the Trump administration said it would  partially fund the programme for the month using emergency funds , setting up another potential showdown before 1 December.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may be interrupted.\n\nServices like federally-funded pre-school and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed, including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nDuring the previous shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, parks were kept open with no staff, which led to vandalism and looting at a number of historical sites.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMost American schools are state-funded, but the federal government is responsible for billions of dollars in grants and student loans, which could effectively come to a halt.\n\nHowever, because the grants are typically awarded during the summer, schools are expected to be largely unaffected during this shutdown, according to the education secretary.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever this time, the White House appears more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. Now he is seeking to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\"  Trump said on 30 September , the day before the shutdown began.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers  may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes .\n\nOn 7 October, Trump told reporters that back pay \"depends on who we're talking about\" and that some workers \"don't deserve to be taken care of\".\n\nMany lawmakers insist this is wrong, including the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who said: \"The law is clear - every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay, period.\"\n\nEarlier in October,  the administration's attempt to to lay off about 4,000 workers  was  temporarily blocked by a federal judge , but the White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still represents a drag. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businessses without other big clients to carry them through.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn (£11.2bn) a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  The key holiday months of November and December are fast approaching and analysts are worried a shutdown will hurt shopping and spending.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could be at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets are a unique aspect of US politics.\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, lasted 35 days - the longest in history.\n\nIt was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

thick and fast to Mumbai-based diabetologist Rahul Baxi - but not just from patients struggling to control blood sugar.\n\nIncreasingly, it is young professionals asking the same thing: \"Doctor, can you start me on weight-loss drugs?\"\n\nRecently, a 23-year-old man came in, worried about the 10kg he'd gained after starting a demanding corporate job. \"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs,\" he said.\n\nDr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.\n\n\"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change,\" he told him.\n\nSuch conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nOriginally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.\n\n\"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.\n\nTwo new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.\n\nBoth belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach. They curb cravings - and in Mounjaro's case, also boost metabolism and energy balance.\n\nTreatment starts with a low dose that's slowly raised to a maintenance level, and weight loss usually begins within weeks.\n\nDoctors warn that most users can regain weight within a year of stopping, as the body resists weight loss and old cravings return. Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.\n\nAlso, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.\n\n\"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos,\" says Dr Baxi.\n\nThe frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.\n\n\"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market.\"\n\nIndia's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm.\n\nNovo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.\n\nWhat India has seen so far may just be the tip of the iceberg. Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a \"magic pill moment\" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.\n\n\"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug,\" says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. \"But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too.\"\n\nDoctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer \"bridal packages\" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has  \"advised caution\"  on the new drugs.\n\n\"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months,\" recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. \"He wanted to know if they really work.\"\n\nOne challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.\n\n\"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease,\" says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  \"Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more.\"\n\n\"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it.\"\n\nObesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. \"It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis,\" says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.\n\n\"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue.\"\n\nDoctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.\n\nEndocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists are increasingly prescribing them to overweight patients to improve heart and kidney outcomes -  for instance, those preparing for angioplasty or stenting.\n\nOrthopaedic surgeons now prescribe them to help patients lose weight before knee surgery, while chest physicians use them for those with sleep apnea, a disorder that blocks the airway during sleep.  \"For patients with sleep apnoea who avoid using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure  (CPAP)  machines, these drugs can help by reducing weight, which in turn improves their sleep,\" says Dr Kamdar.\n\nEven bariatric surgery is evolving with India's obesity boom. From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.\n\nSurgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. \"We don't hand out drugs casually,\" he says. \"Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery.\"\n\nHis message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: \"Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain.\"\n\nAnd for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?\n\nHe has simpler advice: \"Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil. Without that, no weight loss will last. Add four days of exercise a week, and you'll lose those 5-7kg - no injections needed.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg41x3w1zvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"22:11:35.592+00:00","title":"Oscar-nominated actress Dianne Ladd, mother of Laura Dern, dies at 89","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Ladd, a three-time Academy Award nominee and celebrated actress, has died at the age of 89.

When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.\"\n\nArchaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method.\n\nThe same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil.\n\n\"What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"These  guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them.\"\n\nGeological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate.\n\nThe landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,\" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.\n\nThese sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away.  But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food.\"\n\nThe evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them.\n\nAnd this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.\"\n\nThere is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance.\n\n\"The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.\"\n\nAt around 2.75 million years ago, the region was populated by some of the very first humans, who had relatively small brains. These early humans are thought to have lived alongside their evolutionary ancestors: a pre-human group, called australopithecines, who had larger teeth and a mix of chimpanzee and human traits.\n\nThe tool users at Namorotukunan were most likely one of these groups or possibly both.\n\nAnd the finding challenges the notion held by many experts in human evolution that continuous tool use emerged much later, between 2.4 and 2.2 million years ago, when humans had evolved relatively larger brains, according to Prof Braun.\n\n\"The argument is that we're looking at a pretty substantial brain size increase. And so, often the assertion has been that tool use allowed them to feed this large brain.\n\n\"But what we're seeing at Namorotukunan is that these really early tools are used before that brain size increase.\"\n\n\"We have probably vastly underestimated these early humans and human ancestors. We can actually trace the roots of our ability to adapt to change by using technology much earlier than we thought, all the way to 2.75 million years ago, and probably much earlier.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kz7jxe0po","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:43:32.574+00:00","title":"Worker dies after partial collapse of medieval tower in Rome","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Romanian worker, Octav Stroici, died after being trapped beneath a partially collapsed medieval tower, the Torre dei Conti, located near the Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum in Rome.

partial collapse of medieval tower in Rome\n\nA worker who was trapped after part of a medieval tower collapsed in the heart of Rome, has died, according to hospital officials.\n\nOctav Stroici, 66, was pulled free at 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT), nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath.\n\nHis heart stopped in the ambulance, and doctors at the hospital he was rushed to were unable to save him.\n\nThe Romanian foreign ministry said Stroici was a Romanian national, as was another worker among three others pulled from the rubble.\n\nStroici's rescue was initially described as an exceptional feat by firefighters who had worked late into the night. Rescue teams used drones and rubble clearers to try to reach him, despite the risk that the fragile tower could collapse further.\n\nHe had been conscious and talking to the emergency workers throughout the rescue. His wife was also at the scene.\n\nRomania's foreign ministry sent its condolences to his family and said \"together with them, we held on to hope until the very last moment\".\n\nStroici had been carrying out conservation work on the medieval tower just off Rome's busy Via dei Fori Imperiali and close to the Forum itself, one of this city's busiest tourist sites. This particular building had been empty and abandoned for many years.\n\nThe Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident.\n\nPart of the structure collapsed at about 11:20 on Monday and efforts to rescue Stroici were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again about 90 minutes later, as bricks rained down, creating a huge cloud of dust.\n\nRome prefect Lamberto Giannini   had described it as a \"very complex situation\". After the initial collapse he said firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so that when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".\n\nHe added that the rescue was a long operation due to having to \"mitigate... the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".\n\nOne firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to Italian reports, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.\n\nA police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower would disintegrate.\n\n\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.\n\nAnother worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"\n\nRome's mayor and Italy's culture minister visited the scene.\n\nThe 13th Century tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.\n\nIt is separated from the main visitors' area of the Roman Forum by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/trump-nuclear-tests-energy-secretary.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:37:45-05:00","title":"Trump Doubles Down on Nuclear Tests.

And this weekend, the president and his energy secretary, who oversees the development and maintenance of the nuclear stockpile, contradicted each other on the critical question of whether the United States is about to break the three-decade taboo on explosive testing of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn short, Mr. Trump has doubled down on the concept that he has ordered a resumption of explosive nuclear testing — which the United States has refrained from for 33 years — to match what he contends were secret nuclear underground detonations, presumably by Russia, China, and other nuclear-armed states. But that claim has been rejected by many nuclear experts and Mr. Trump’s own nominee to lead the U.S. Strategic Command, which is responsible for America’s ground-based, undersea and bomber-launched nuclear weapons.\n\n“They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test,” Mr. Trump said in an interview that was recorded on Friday with CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test, and we don’t test. We have to test.” Mr. Trump pointed to Russia, China and North Korea and others as making unspecified tests.\n\nOn Sunday, Chris Wright, Mr. Trump’s energy secretary, appeared to contradict Mr. Trump when he indicated the United States has no intention of conducting new explosive tests, and would simply continue its regular testing of nuclear components and systems to ensure they are working properly.\n\n“These will be nonnuclear explosions,” Mr. Wright said on “The Sunday Briefing” on Fox News. “These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The president was also set to appear at virtual rallies for Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nHe has said the Supreme Court will be making “one of the most important and consequential decisions ever made” by the nation’s highest court when it considers the legality of his tariffs on Wednesday.\n\nAnd if Mr. Trump continues his standoff with congressional Democrats, by week’s end he will oversee the longest, and potentially most painful, government shutdown in history, one that recent polling shows Americans are increasingly blaming him for.\n\nThe series of events, experts say, has presented Mr. Trump with a pressure test of his go-to governance style — unilateralism — that has marked his second term.\n\n“It’s an odd confluence to have these three potential checks on presidential power — legislative, judicial and electoral — all come in one week,” said Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and senior fellow at theRonald Reagan Institute.\n\n“All these things are systemic challenges to unilateral power,” he added. “What does the Supreme Court do? You can do a lot of things with just the majority in Congress, but there are some things you can’t do — keeping the government open is one of them. And then obviously you need political popularity to carry out a lot of executive actions or unilateralist actions, and an election is a check on presidential popularity.”\n\nIn a statement, the White House sought to downplay the stakes of the week ahead.\n\n“Every week is pivotal when Americans have a president who is all gas, no brakes on his push to Make America Great Again,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has indicated that he recognizes the stakes.\n\nBy far the most important day on Mr. Trump’s mind is Wednesday, when the Supreme Court will hear a case challenging whether his use of a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose steep taxes on major U.S. trading partners, was unlawful.\n\nMr. Trump has maintained that the case is one of the most consequential not just of his presidency, but also in the country’s history. He says that tariffs have enabled him to strengthen the economy and the country’s standing in the world after years of other countries taking advantage of the United States. Some economists have noted, however, that the tariffs have contributed to price increases for American consumers.\n\n“If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media Sunday. “If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status — Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!”\n\nMr. Trump has used social media to endorse candidates in Tuesday’s elections, taking a particular interest in governor races in New Jersey and Virginia, which are seen as a forecast of what could happen in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trump has not campaigned in person in either state, but has lent considerable real estate on his social media website, Truth Social.\n\n“Virginia and New Jersey, VOTE REPUBLICAN IF YOU WANT MASSIVE ENERGY COST AND CRIME REDUCTIONS,” he wrote on Sunday. “The Democrats will double and even triple your Energy Costs, and CRIME will be rampant. A vote for the Democrats is a DEATH WISH!”\n\nFive minutes later, Mr. Trump posted another message assailing the Democratic candidates in both states.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump initially sought to intervene in the New York City mayor’s race, he has largely resorted to threatening to punish the city if it elects Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“It’s going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,” Mr. Trump told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired on Sunday. “Because if you have a communist running New York, all you’re doing is wasting the money you’re sending there.”\n\nMr. Mamdani is not a communist; he is a democratic socialist.\n\nAsked for his reaction to the fact that some people have compared him to Mr. Mamdani, both having charisma and a knack for breaking political rules, Mr. Trump replied: “Well, I think I’m a much better-looking person than him, right?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/world/americas/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-black-river.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:15:37-05:00","title":"‘The Whole Place Is Blown Apart’: 90% of Jamaican Town’s Homes Destroyed","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit Jamaica, caused catastrophic damage to the coastal town of Black River, where 90% of homes and critical public infrastructure such as the courthouse, library, schools, and downtown shopping district were destroyed.

A man armed with a large knife, who is believed to have joined the train at Peterborough, carried out a vicious attack on multiple victims. Within 20 minutes a suspect had been arrested in Cambridgeshire, more than 70 miles from the train's intended destination of King's Cross in London.\n\nEleven people were treated in hospital, where one person remains in a stable but critical condition. The BBC has spoken to train passengers and stabbing victims alongside video and police statements to build a picture of how the attack and the emergency response unfolded.\n\nThe attack started just over an hour after the LNER train left Doncaster. At 19:29 it had pulled out of Peterborough station, where the suspect had apparently boarded. Just five minutes later the alarm was pulled near the middle of the train in coach J.\n\nAmira Ostalski and a friend, both students at Nottingham University, had got on the train at the previous stop of Grantham and were travelling to London to \"have some fun\".\n\nAmira was seated watching a film when she saw a man in a white shirt leap out of his seat about five rows in front of her followed by screams of \"knife, knife\". Amira then spotted a man holding a large kitchen knife and fled towards the rear of the train with her friend.\n\nIn the next carriage, coach H, YouTuber Olly Foster heard shouts of \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and initially thought it was a Halloween prank. But as passengers began pushing through the carriage Olly could see \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on, covering his hand in blood.\n\nOlly then saw an older man, thought to be an LNER staff member, who \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck.\n\nNottingham Forest fan Joe, 24, was not meant to be on the train. He had watched the team's football match against Manchester United earlier and missed a connecting train in Grantham.\n\nJoe was texting his friends about his plans for the night when people came rushing through the carriage. \"You need to run, you need to run,\" someone told Joe. He started running but when he turned to look behind him saw \"a tall black male\" holding \"a bloodied knife\".\n\nMatt Kingston took his headphones out as he saw a group of people heading his way in coach H and also began running down the train. Another Nottingham Forest fan Alistair Day, 58, was next to the train's cafe bar in coach G, and saw people fleeing down the train with blood on their clothes.\n\nThe train's cafe bar transformed into an impromptu hiding space for those fleeing the attacker. Alistair said he saw around a dozen people inside this enclosed buffet counter in coach G and they were \"trying to close up the shutters\" to protect themselves from the assailant. Matt had managed to get inside the booth with the others.\n\nAlistair saw the man near the door waving a knife and trying to open the shutters, which by then had been locked. A video he provided to the BBC from inside the cafe bar shows multiple passengers inside, with at least one on the phone to emergency services. Alistair and another witness, Tom McLaughlan, told the BBC they saw a Nottingham Forest fan move to confront the attacker. \"He wasn't the biggest guy. We tried to stop him,\" Alistair said.\n\nIt appears they were referring to Stephen Crean who later told the BBC the man pulled out a large knife when he confronted him outside the cafe bar. \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and caught me on the head.\"\n\nStephen said he had been trying to give another passenger time to close the door to the cafe bar. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"\n\nMatt said the attacker then walked past the locked door while waving the knife around. \"He then returned back up the train and passed us again.\" At that point a young man told Matt he'd been stabbed in the chest \"so I helped with putting pressure on the wound and helped hold him up\".\n\nAnother victim of the train attack was Scunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, who was slashed across the bicep and later needed an operation.\n\nAs soon as the alarm was raised the train driver, Andrew Johnson, a Royal Navy veteran, sprang into action and contacted the control centre. The decision was made to divert the train, which was travelling at 125mph (201km/h), to a slow track, which allowed it stop at Huntingdon Station just minutes after the emergency services were first called.\n\nThe East of England Ambulance Service received the first emergency call at 19:38. A minute later, Cambridgeshire police received a report about multiple stabbings on a train. Together, they mobilised a response team outside Huntingdon Station, just under 300m away from the police force's headquarters. At 19:41 the train arrived at the station, a minute before British Transport Police were also called to the incident.\n\nCCTV footage captured by a business in its car park shows passengers running up platform two towards the main station building. A dramatic TikTok video, filmed from a bridge on Brampton Road overlooking the rail tracks and station, shows police officers running towards the train along the same platform.\n\nTom saw two men who appeared to have been stabbed \"covered in blood\" as he fled the train. Alistair said he saw a man who had been in the cafe bar with him being carried towards an ambulance by paramedics. \"I just want to know he's okay,\" he said.\n\nEmergency services took 10 people to hospital where a further victim was treated. Six patients have since been discharged.\n\nThe LNER staff member who remains in a critical but stable condition \"undoubtedly saved people's lives\" by trying to stop the attacker, British Transport Police said.\n\nCCTV footage shows a man climbing a fence at the station at 19:43 to an adjacent car park while holding a knife.\n\nAmira, who had been hiding at the back of coach G armed with a metal tray to fight off the attacker if necessary, had run to the car park with her friend for safety when they got off the train.\n\nBut they saw the man walk in their direction. Fearing for their lives, they hid in a taxi. An image captured by Amira's friend through its windscreen shows the man being detained by six police officers near several bins in the car park, around 50m (160ft) from the fence.\n\nVideo filmed from a separate taxi nearby shows the officers armed with guns, Tasers and accompanied by a dog detaining a man on the ground. Clicks from the Taser are audible in the footage.\n\nBy 19:50 police had two men in custody, 32-year-old Anthony Williams, and a 35-year-old man who was released a day later after police established he was not involved. On Monday morning Williams appeared in court charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over the train attack.\n\nAdditional reporting by Adam Durbin."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/movies/diane-ladd-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:04:03-05:00","title":"Diane Ladd, Versatile Film Actress, Is Dead at 89","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Ladd, a Mississippi-born film actress who passed away at 89 in Ojai, California, was celebrated for her deeply nuanced and eccentric performances across more than six decades.

It did not cite a cause.\n\nMs. Ladd, who was a respected actress more than a world-famous movie star, never won an Academy Award, but she was nominated three times, in roles that displayed her range.\n\nShe was Flo, the sassy and foulmouthed but deeply compassionate Southern waitress, in Martin Scorsese’s “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” (1974); Marietta Fortune, a seductive, malevolent former beauty queen who hires a hit man to kill her daughter’s boyfriend, in David Lynch’s “Wild at Heart” (1990); and a quietly noble Mississippi housewife who defends the family’s indiscreet young maid in Martha Coolidge’s “Rambling Rose” (1991).\n\nThat final nomination brought with it the distinction of being the first time in academy history that a real-life mother and daughter (Ms. Ladd and Ms. Dern) had been nominated for the same picture — Ms. Ladd for best supporting actress and Ms. Dern for best actress.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

China’s Export Juggernaut Marches On\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T23:03:02-05:00\n\nAs President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on China, American importers are buying much less.\n\nBut the rest of the world is making up the difference, buying more from China than ever.\n\nChina has offset the decline from America with breathtaking speed. Shipments to other parts of the world have surged this year, demonstrating that China’s manufacturing dominance will not be easily slowed. Chinese exports are on track to reach another record this year.\n\nThat’s because China was prepared. It has been seeking out new customers for years, and its massive manufacturing investment allows it to sell goods at low prices.\n\n“They should not be surprised that China is able to find markets outside of the advanced economies,” said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump reduced the tariffs he imposed on China, though they remain at heights not seen in decades. He insists that his tariffs will force a revival of American factories and create jobs — a pledge that is contested by many economists and manufacturing experts. It is also unclear how effective his policies will be in stemming the flow of goods that originate in China and route through other countries before arriving in the United States.\n\nNote: Chart shows China’s quarterly export amount.\n\nThe rest of the world is caught between the two superpowers. Some countries, including Vietnam 28% and members of the European Union 11%, are deeply concerned about the risk posed by China’s exports to their own industries, and China faces a backlash in the form of tariffs in regions like Europe. Other nations, like Argentina 57% and Nigeria 45%, are buying low-cost Chinese technology to modernize their economies but running up wider trade imbalances with China.\n\nFor years, Americans have turned to China to outfit their homes and stock their offices. While the volume of Chinese exports remains enormous, the declines this year are widespread and drastic. The United States is buying less of almost everything from China:\n\nNote: Only products whose exports from China to the U.S. changed by more than $50 million between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025 are shown.\n\nTake, for example, plastic goods. China exported $5 billion of those products — from laundry baskets to plastic forks — to the United States between July and October, down 16 percent from a year earlier.\n\nLast year, over a quarter of all Chinese-made furniture, including mattresses and lamps, went to the United States; now that number is closer to a fifth.\n\nChina’s exports of phones 47% and computers 54% to the United States were among the categories that declined the most. Mr. Trump exempted such consumer electronics from most of his tariffs this year, but Apple, Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturers have continued to diversify their supply chains outside China. The United States now gets most of its smartphones from India and its laptop computers from Vietnam, according to the latest quarterly data available from June from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nMeanwhile, China is flooding developing economies in Africa 42% and South America 13% with cars, trucks, bikes and ships; it is expanding in Europe 7% and Asia 14% by shipping batteries and iron products.\n\nAfter decades of top-down priorities established by Beijing’s industrial policies, China has become the world’s leading producer of cars, batteries and solar panels. Struggling consumer demand in its domestic economy has put even more pressure on Chinese companies to find new business abroad.\n\nChina also produced record amounts of steel over the past few years. This is now sold across the world at prices sometimes cheaper than bottled water.\n\nMany African countries bought few of these items from China before this year. China sold only about 100 electric cars to Nigeria two years ago; this year it has already sold thousands. Solar panel shipments to Algeria thus far this year is already nearly four times that of all of last year.\n\nChina’s growing exports to Africa come as Mr. Trump has pulled back aid to the continent. Chinese companies are sacrificing profits by selling to Africa at low prices, but are, in many cases, gaining influence.\n\n“The margins may not be as high,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But for those markets, it's entirely transformational to have access to this technology at affordable prices.”\n\nThere are exceptions to China’s ability to successfully make up for lost revenue by selling to American customers and redirecting exports elsewhere. Chinese companies, for example, make most of the world’s toys, and the United States has long been its largest customer. Over the summer, China’s exports of video game consoles, costumes and board games fell $3.5 billion over last year, mostly due to a steep decline in shipments to the United States.\n\nIt remains to be seen how effective Mr. Trump will be in pressuring countries, especially those in Asia, to reject rerouted Chinese exports as part of trade negotiations. These workarounds limited the impact of his trade measures with China during his first term.\n\nOne thing is certain: American consumers are buying more goods from other parts of Asia. In September, Thailand’s exports to the United States rose by 33 percent. Taiwan’s exports also grew by 51 percent, and Singapore’s by 13 percent.\n\nThe shifts in China’s exports are part of what is expected to be a continuing and unpredictable transformation. Mr. Trump’s tariff reduction last week, which he said lowered overall tariffs on China to about 45 percent from about 55 percent, could stabilize China’s exports to the United States, said Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the RAND China Research Center.\n\nBut despite agreeing to a one-year trade truce with China, Mr. Trump is considering whether to impose additional tariffs on industries dominated by China, such as pharmaceuticals and drones. He is vowing to wean America off its reliance on China for some critical minerals. With more than three years left in office, Mr. Trump’s campaign to reshape trade is unlikely to end here.\n\nAbout the data: The change in trade is calculated based on export data reported by China Customs for July through September this year, compared with the same period last year. Trade values are in U.S. dollars. Data is omitted for trade partners that imported less than $500 million from China in the third quarter of this year. The top graphic shows only trade partners with more than $100 million in year-over-year change. The export amounts from other countries to the United States are based on data reported by those countries.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/opinion/nick-fuentes-kirk-successor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"19:36:40-05:00","title":"Nick Fuentes Was Charlie Kirk’s Bitter Enemy.

Now He’s Becoming His Successor.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T19:36:40-05:00\n\nCharlie Kirk, the conservative influencer who was assassinated in September, and Nick Fuentes, the young Hitler-loving white nationalist at the center of a growing schism on the right, were bitter enemies.\n\nFuentes despised Kirk for his support of Israel, and, more broadly, for his efforts to marginalize Fuentes’s gleefully racist and fascist brand of politics. In 2019, seeking to expose Kirk as “anti-white” and a “fake patriot,” Fuentes organized his army of young fans — known as Groypers, after a variant on the alt-right Pepe the Frog meme — to flood events held by Kirk’s organization, Turning Point, and ask hostile questions. At one, they drove Donald Trump Jr. off the stage.\n\nAfter Kirk was murdered, Fuentes, perhaps fearing he’d be blamed, disavowed violence. But he continued his attacks on Turning Point and accused Kirk’s widow, Erika, of being happy her husband was dead. “I am getting this vibe from her that she’s very fake,” he said.\n\nEven as Fuentes defamed Kirk’s widow, powerful conservatives were engaged in a nationwide campaign to canonize Kirk and destroy progressives who maligned him. Guest-hosting Kirk’s podcast, JD Vance urged listeners to report anyone celebrating Kirk’s death to their employers. In such an atmosphere, one might think that Fuentes’s stock on the right would have fallen. Instead, it’s risen higher than ever, revealing a seemingly unstoppable ratchet of radicalization on the right.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Fuentes’s ideology, he helpfully distilled it on his streaming show, “America First,” in March. “Jews are running society, women need to shut up,” he said, using an obscenity. “Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part.” His sneering, proudly transgressive attitude has made him a hero to legions of mostly young men who resent all forms of political gatekeeping. The conservative writer Rod Dreher, a close friend of Vance, warned, “I am told by someone in a position to know that something like 30 to 40 percent of D.C. G.O.P. staffers under the age of 30 are Groypers.” The figure is impossible to check, but it captures a widespread sense that Fuentes’s politics are ascendant.\n\nPlenty of conservatives, especially Jewish ones, abhor Fuentes’s growing clout. But by cheering on Donald Trump as he promoted conspiracy theories and systematically destroyed bulwarks against nativism and bigotry in the Republican Party, they helped make Fuentes’s rise possible.\n\nFuentes reached a career high last week when he was invited onto Tucker Carlson’s podcast, one of the most popular shows in the country. Carlson gently took issue with a few things Fuentes has said, especially the idea that Jews as a whole are responsible for the sins of Israel and neoconservatism. “I feel like going on about ‘the Jews’ helps the neocons,” Carlson said at one point. But their two-hour conversation was overwhelmingly friendly. Carlson seemed to presume that they were on the same side; his disagreements with Fuentes were mostly about means, not ends.\n\nConservatives who detest antisemitism were shaken by the interview. They were even more alarmed when Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation — long a bastion of the conservative establishment — defended Carlson. “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians,” he said in a video, describing Carlson’s critics as a “venomous coalition” who are “sowing division.”\n\nThese comments led to an uproar among some of Heritage’s donors, staff members and supporters, and Roberts attempted to quell it by denouncing Fuentes. But he still seems to think that Carlson was right to give him a hearing. In a message to the Heritage staff obtained by National Review, Roberts rejected “censorship and purity tests,” writing, “Canceling one person today guarantees the purge of many tomorrow.”\n\nRoberts is not against cancel culture in principle; he cheered Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension from ABC for his comments about Kirk’s murder. But he’s very much opposed to the cancellation of conservatives, no matter how extreme, and he’s not alone. On much of the MAGA right, attempts to impose taboos have themselves become the ultimate taboo. This stance is summed up by the phrase “no enemies to the right,” which has become common enough in MAGA world that it’s sometimes written as an acronym, NETTR.\n\nFor decades, mainstream conservatives spoke proudly of how William F. Buckley Jr., the founding editor of National Review, excommunicated the paranoiac and reactionary John Birch Society from the conservative movement. The story of Buckley’s cordon sanitaire was always a bit of a myth; the border between respectable conservatism and the far-right demimonde remained quite permeable. But it was a helpful myth, since it valorized a willingness to draw lines.\n\nTrump all but annihilated that willingness, and many MAGA intellectuals now see Buckley’s quarantine as a mistake. Laura Field, in her excellent new book “Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right,” quotes the writer and activist Charles Haywood calling Buckley a “Judas” who “led the American Right into a box canyon, swiftly spiking any gun that seemed as if it might be effective in the war waged by the Left on decent America for over a hundred years.”\n\nNot all conservatives embrace the idea of “no enemies to the right” — Dreher has written powerfully against it — but it’s become a significant current in our politics. When Politico reported that several Young Republican leaders took part in a racist group chat that included praise for Hitler, some in the party were appalled, and a few of the participants lost their jobs. But Vance defended them as “kids” whose lives shouldn’t ruined for telling jokes. (Some were in their 30s). Within certain MAGA circles, to criticize someone for being too racist or reactionary is a betrayal, signaling an acceptance of the very liberal morality that the movement’s vanguard seeks to destroy.\n\nKirk, who came of age in the pre-Trump conservative movement, was still sometimes willing to police boundaries. But in the wake of his killing, there’s surprisingly little sense on the right that that part of his legacy should be upheld. Rather, prominent voices insist that Kirk’s murder necessitates the final loosening of all remaining restraints. “I cannot ‘unite’ with the left because they want me dead,” the influential podcaster Matt Walsh posted after Kirk’s death. “But I will unite with anyone on the right.”\n\nAdrian Vermeule, the Harvard law professor who has helped create the intellectual foundation for the post-liberal right, put it more elegantly this weekend, as the fight over Carlson, Fuentes and Roberts roiled conservatives. “History records many cases in which cities fell to siege because, even with the enemy at the very gates, factions within the city could not put aside their mutual struggle for domination,” he wrote on social media. Lest there be any doubt about which factions he was scolding, he made it clear in a subsequent post: “I’ll be resolutely ignoring the views of those who profess a certain ‘conservatism’ but who have never actually challenged the liberal consensus on anything that might endanger their careers.”\n\nVermeule is a cultivated man who, as Field writes, is part of a movement that “thinks it has a monopoly on things like ‘the true, the good and the beautiful.’” Yet however lofty his rhetoric, its moral logic leads inexorably to Groyperism, and the elevation of Fuentes, Kirk’s foe, into his successor.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Indoor ranges with hard walls reflect and amplify these waves, increasing peak pressure and potentially leading to cumulative brain injury from repeated exposure.

Experts warn that the current safety standards are outdated and insufficient, with growing evidence suggesting that even low-level, repeated exposures may cause neurological harm. The article recommends practical measures like shooting outdoors, using suppressors, or choosing smaller calibers to reduce risk. It also highlights that symptoms like headaches and brain fog are common, often misattributed to noise or fatigue, and may indicate underlying brain injury.","keyTakeAways":["Target shooting,

We Measured the Danger.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-03T15:41:44-05:00\n\nBy Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Dave Philipps and Jeremy White Cinematography by Zach Caldwell and Jonah Markowitz\n\nBy The New York Times Cinematography by Zach Caldwell and Jonah Markowitz\n\nEvery day, thousands of people use indoor gun ranges that are designed to limit the hazards of target shooting, including lead exposure and stray bullets. But shooting indoors poses another hazard that has been almost entirely overlooked: Concussive blast waves that can damage the brain.\n\nEvidence has emerged from the U.S. military that firing some military weapons can damage brain cells, and repeated exposure may cause permanent injuries. But there is next to no public information about the strength of the blast waves delivered by civilian firearms, or the potential hazard.\n\nSo The New York Times did its own testing, and gathered its own data. Reporters measured the blasts of several popular civilian guns at an indoor range, using the same sensors that the military uses. The data showed that some large-caliber civilian rifles delivered a blast wave that exceeds what the military says is safe for the brain, and firing smaller-caliber guns repeatedly could quickly add up to potentially harmful exposure. The data also showed that indoor shooting ranges designed to make shooting safe inadvertently make blast exposure worse — doubling and sometimes tripling the amplitude of the blast.\n\nEach time a gun is fired, a supersonic pressure wave surges from the muzzle back toward the person pulling the trigger.\n\nEach time a gun is fired, a supersonic pressure wave surges from the muzzle back toward the person pulling the trigger.\n\nThese sensors measure the pressure of the blast wave hitting the body, in pounds per square inch, or P.S.I.\n\nThese sensors measure the pressure of the blast wave hitting the body, in pounds per square inch, or P.S.I.\n\nThe readings captured for this 9-mm pistol, for example, were relatively low for a single shot, but that doesn’t mean the blasts are safe.\n\nThe readings captured for this 9-mm pistol, for example, were relatively low for a single shot, but that doesn’t mean the blasts are safe.\n\nThe brain is a delicate network of about 100 trillion connections with a consistency close to Jell-O, and how blasts affect that network is still poorly understood. Experts don’t yet know what level of blast can damage the tissue, or whether blasts that are safe in limited numbers can cause harm with repeated exposure.\n\nWith so much unknown, many firearms experts and neurologists say the safest course of action is to limit exposure as much as possible.\n\nThe data shows that shooting indoors does the opposite.\n\nThere are thousands of indoor ranges in the United States, and many have a similar layout: A row of lanes separated by bullet-resistant walls. Soft, shock-absorbent paneling is not standard and without it the booth can act like an echo chamber, reflecting more of the blast waves back toward the shooter.\n\nThe initial blast wave from firing a pistol takes only about 2.5 milliseconds to pass through the shooter’s body.\n\nThe initial blast wave from firing a pistol takes only about 2.5 milliseconds to pass through the shooter’s body.\n\nSoon after, other waves that have bounced off hard surfaces come back toward the shooter’s head.\n\nSoon after, other waves that have bounced off hard surfaces come back toward the shooter’s head.\n\nEach time the shooter fires, the reflected waves converge, increasing the peak pressure.\n\nEach time the shooter fires, the reflected waves converge, increasing the peak pressure.\n\nAs the waves surge through brain tissue, they bounce off surfaces like the back of the skull.\n\nAs the waves surge through brain tissue, they bounce off surfaces like the back of the skull.\n\nIf the blast waves are strong enough, neurons can fray or break.\n\nIf the blast waves are strong enough, neurons can fray or break.\n\nThe potential for harm from blast waves gets almost no attention from the shooting public, even though people can experience concussion-like symptoms after a day at the range, said Jeff Balcourt, who is an acoustic consultant for the National Shooting Sports Foundation and a designer of indoor ranges for Balco Defense Company.\n\n“It’s one of those unspoken things,” he said. “You don’t realize that after a whole day of shooting, you have that ringing in your ears and that headache.”\n\nEach blast creates waves of rapidly changing high and low pressure. The power of the blast is typically measured by recording the peak pressure of the biggest wave.\n\nThe U.S. military currently says that any blast wave that peaks below 4 P.S.I. is safe — though that guideline is not based on solid evidence, and will likely change as research progresses.\n\nIn The Times tests, sensors showed that the booth walls doubled the peak pressure for many guns, compared with shooting in the open. With a .357 revolver, the peak pressure tripled.\n\nThe design of this semiautomatic pistol directs most of the blast forward, limiting exposure to the shooter.\n\nThe design of this semiautomatic pistol directs most of the blast forward, limiting exposure to the shooter.\n\nThe shotgun’s long barrel puts more distance between the shooter and the source of the blast.\n\nThe shotgun’s long barrel puts more distance between the shooter and the source of the blast.\n\nThe gap between the revolver’s barrel and cylinder directs some of the blast back toward the shooter.\n\nThe gap between the revolver’s barrel and cylinder directs some of the blast back toward the shooter.\n\nAR-15s often have a muzzle device that directs the blast wave laterally.

This sends more of the blast toward the shooter.\n\nThe smaller-caliber weapons that The Times tested at an indoor range created blasts that measured 1.3 P.S.I. on average — far below the military’s 4 p.s.i safety threshold.\n\nBut one gun far exceeded what the military says is safe. A .50-caliber rifle — one of the more powerful guns on the market, which shoots a thumb-sized high-velocity projectile originally designed to pierce vehicle armor — measured 7.6 P.S.I. on average when fired from a prone position.\n\nThe rifle’s supersonic blast wave hits the shooter’s head in a fraction of the time that it takes to blink, but using a high-speed camera The Times was able to capture it.\n\nA .50-caliber rifle requires a powerful explosion to propel a heavy bullet at high speed and creates a powerful blast wave.\n\nA .50-caliber rifle requires a powerful explosion to propel a heavy bullet at high speed and creates a powerful blast wave.\n\nThe rifle has a muzzle brake designed to limit recoil, but the brake also directs the blast wave back toward the shooter.\n\nThe rifle has a muzzle brake designed to limit recoil, but the brake also directs the blast wave back toward the shooter.\n\nThe Times hung a metallic fabric curtain behind the shooter to make the blast wave visible.

He compared the stress put on neurons to what happens to a well-used rubber band.\n\n“Stretch a rubber band a hundred times and it bounces back, but there are micro tears forming,” he said. “The hundred-and-first time, it breaks.”\n\nThe potential for harm from blasts is so poorly understood that even the U.S. military’s official safety threshold — 4 P.S.I. — is not based on real evidence. It’s only a place-holder, borrowed from decades-old guidelines for eardrum injuries. The military uses it because it doesn’t have the data yet to arrive at an evidence-based number for the brain.\n\nThe actual threshold for brain tissue damage may be much lower than 4 P.S.I. The Canadian military’s recommended safety threshold is 3 P.S.I. A U.S. Army study found symptoms of brain injury in grenade range instructors who were exposed to hundreds of blasts that measured less than 1 P.S.I.\n\nIt’s not clear how low the injury threshold might go. It’s not even clear that measuring peak pressure is the best way to gauge the risk.\n\nThe current military safety guideline looks only at a blast wave’s highest overpressure peak. But blast waves have dozens of peaks that can pulse through the brain in a few milliseconds.\n\nIncreasingly, Army researchers believe that it may be just as important to calculate the total area of all those peaks — a measurement known as “positive impulse” — and then add up those measurements for every blast a person is exposed to in a day.\n\nIn recent studies, the Army found that soldiers who were repeatedly exposed over a day of training to a number of blasts that measured around 4 P.S.I. were likely to show signs of slowed cognitive functioning — a possible indicator of brain injury — if the cumulative positive impulse of those blasts added up to 31.7 P.S.I.·milliseconds or more. In other words, multiple blasts within safe levels appeared to add up to an overall exposure that was not safe.\n\nBased on the findings, the military is now considering whether to use a cumulative positive impulse exposure of 31.7 P.S.I.·milliseconds as part of a new daily safety limit. The potential new approach marks a stark change in how the military thinks about the hazard of blast waves. It is being reported here for the first time.\n\nThe Times measured an AR-15 rifle against that limit and found that while the peak overpressure of one shot was just 1.6 P.S.I., it took only 20 shots at an indoor range to exceed the proposed daily threshold for cumulative positive impulse. And it can happen fast.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean that repeatedly firing an AR-15 rifle will cause a brain injury. But a lot is still unknown.\n\nOne of the Army’s lead blast exposure researchers, Walter Carr, said the military had largely focused on the short-term effects of large military weapons, such as artillery, and there had been almost no research on smaller-caliber guns like the AR-15.\n\nA single AR-15 blast might be too small to cause damage, he said. But he cautioned that researchers have not answered that question, and still know little about the cumulative effects of months or years of firing rifles. In the absence of definitive data, he said, many people in the military are informally taking precautions to limit blast exposure whenever possible.\n\n“We didn’t evolve with explosives surrounding us for a period of years,” Mr. Carr said. “It’s a very non-natural type of an exposure. It seems reasonable that there should be consequences.”\n\nDiscussions in online shooting forums show that shooting enthusiasts regularly mention concussion-like symptoms, but talk about the risk of brain injury is rare. Post-shooting symptoms like headaches, fatigue and brain fog, which may be related to a brain injury, are often attributed instead to noise, tight-fitting protective gear, dehydration or poor ventilation.\n\nOne person may feel fine after shooting, and another may feel concussed, because not everyone is affected in the same way. Age, fitness level, prior history of contact sports, pre-existing brain injuries and other factors may all make some people more vulnerable than others.\n\nBottom line: Many neurologists say that if you are feeling ill effects from shooting, limit your exposure.\n\nNote: Measurements shown are the average of the three highest readings for weapons fired from inside a range booth.\n\nFortunately, there are simple ways to limit exposure. The Times found that shooting in an open outdoor setting, rather than in an enclosed booth, can cut blast levels by more than half. When shooting indoors, ensuring that the gun barrel extends beyond the booth can reduce exposure. Choosing smaller caliber weapons and less powerful ammunition can also help.\n\nAttaching a suppressor or blast regulator to the muzzle to direct the blast forward and away from the shooter can also make a big difference. In The Times testing, the blast from firing an AR-15 rifle indoors measured as high as 1.7 P.S.I. When a blast regulator was added, the measurement fell to less than 0.5 P.S.I.\n\nSuppressors and regulators are often used by law enforcement and the military, but they’re pricey, and suppressors are tightly regulated in some states and illegal in others.\n\nLucas Botkin, who founded the popular firearms parts and accessories company T.Rex Arms and hosts a popular YouTube channel focused on shooting, said the concussive damage from shooting is a big reason muzzle devices like suppressors should be widely used.\n\n“I know I’ve been messed up,” Mr. Botkin said. “And I have a bunch of buddies who are blasted just from shooting small arms for hundreds of thousands of rounds.”\n\nThe Times recorded blast overpressure using the BlackBox Biometrics Blast Gauge System, with sensors fastened to the chest and the right side of the head of the shooter, recreating a setup regularly used to record blast exposure in the military. We used only the readings from the head gauge for this report. The readings from the chest gauge were used to check the reliability of the head gauge readings.\n\nThe gauges automatically calculate peak positive pressure and positive impulse for each shot. We added up individual positive impulse readings of the head gauge to determine the cumulative positive impulse of multiple shots. The ammunition used for the tests were common training rounds that are often used for target practice. The AR-15 was tested with both 5.56 mm and .223-caliber ammunition; the two types yielded similar blast readings.\n\nFor most weapons, averages using the three highest recorded readings are shown. For the Desert Eagle, the average of two readings is shown.\n\nPentagon researchers say weapons like shoulder-fired rockets expose troops who fire them to blast waves far above safety limits, but they remain in wide use.\n\nA military lab found distinctive damage from repeated blast exposure in every brain it tested, but Navy SEAL leaders were kept in the dark about the pattern.\n\nSoldiers exposed to thousands of low-level blasts from firing weapons like mortars say that they wind up with debilitating symptoms of traumatic brain injury — but no diagnosis.\n\nAdditional production by Caterina Clerici, Brad Kimbrough and Chris Del Sesto.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/stephen-miller-activist-battle-free-speech.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:42:44-05:00","title":"The Battle in Virginia Over an Activist Who Protested Stephen Miller","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal and state investigation into Barbara Wien, a retired academic and activist, has sparked a legal and political controversy over free speech and security in Virginia.

The investigation remains active, leaving it unclear whether law enforcement has since gathered additional evidence.\n\nThe dispute captures the fierce tensions over political activism that have become a defining feature of the second Trump presidency, pitting the Miller family’s concerns for their security against the First Amendment claims of a critic of the administration.\n\nIn an atmosphere in which political violence against Republicans and Democrats has become more common, administration officials have increasingly voiced worries about their security, citing in particular the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and two attempts in 2024 to kill Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut liberal groups and activists say the White House is seeking to demonize its political opponents and use the levers of government to stamp out opposing views in the name of public safety.\n\nAt the heart of the clash is whether the involvement of federal authorities in investigating a local act of protest, and the tactics used by state and federal investigators, amount to overkill, or whether Ms. Wien posed a true threat to Mr. Miller and his family.\n\nA lawyer for Ms. Wien and a county prosecutor have raised concerns over the conduct of the investigation, including the involvement of multiple federal and state agencies. They have also raised questions about the issuance of the search warrant for Ms. Wien’s phone by state authorities based on evidence that she might have committed a misdemeanor.\n\nMs. Wien’s lawyer, Bradley R. Haywood, said law enforcement agencies were misusing their authority to pursue a political critic.\n\nThe county prosecutor, a Democrat, has accused the state attorney general’s office, led by a Republican, of overstepping its authority in trying to intervene in the case.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said that the law enforcement response was warranted, noting that Mr. Trump and others in his administration had been targets of members of the public. “Doxxing and any other actions that directly threaten the safety of officials and their families should be resoundingly denounced and thoroughly investigated to ensure attacks against members of the administration are not realized,” she said.\n\nCourt documents cite the Secret Service and F.B.I. as participants in the investigation. Asked for comment, an F.B.I. spokesman said that the bureau had acted appropriately and that the allegations against Ms. Wien that were under investigation went well beyond First Amendment-protected activity. A spokesman for the Secret Service said he was aware of the case and declined to comment further.\n\nOne federal statute makes it a crime to make public information like a home address of a government official, but only if the intent behind the disclosure is to “threaten, intimidate, or incite the commission or a crime of violence,” or with knowledge that the information will be used to do so.\n\nVirginia state law makes it a misdemeanor to publish a person’s name or photograph along with their home address “with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass another person.”\n\nThe investigation centers on Ms. Wien, 65, a retired academic who, along with others, has protested outside the home in northern Arlington where Mr. Miller lived with his family at the time. The police say she has circulated leaflets in the neighborhood denouncing Mr. Miller and his hard-line policies, including on immigration.\n\nOne of those leaflets featured Mr. Miller’s photograph and address. To a state investigator assigned to the case, such identifying information amounted to the kind of harassment that could violate state law.\n\nThe Millers recently moved into military housing in Fort McNair, in Washington, after the protest group in September scrawled messages critical of the Trump administration in chalk on the sidewalk outside their six-bedroom home. One of the messages read, “Stephen Miller is destroying democracy.”\n\nThe state police, accompanied by the F.B.I. and Secret Service, arrived at Ms. Wien’s door on Oct. 1 with a search warrant for her cellphone, according to court filings. A day later, a lawyer for Ms. Wien began fighting the warrant, arguing that it was overly broad and unjustified, violating her rights.\n\n“In 22 years, I have never seen a situation like this,” Mr. Haywood said in an interview. The investigation, he said, raises concerns about whether “our state police is carrying water for an administration that is suppressing free speech.”\n\nA spokesman for the Virginia State Police declined to comment because the investigation remained open.\n\nThe Virginia State Police became involved after a request from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, according to Richard Cullen, who serves as a counselor to Mr. Youngkin.\n\nThe governor “asked his secretary of public safety to look into it and make sure the family was getting the level of protection they deserved,” Mr. Cullen said. “That’s being prudent in today’s world.”\n\nMr. Youngkin had issued similar instructions in the past about Supreme Court justices and Antony J. Blinken, then the secretary of state, after threats and protests erupted near their homes.\n\nMr. Miller, one of the most powerful figures in the federal government, is a driving force behind the Trump administration’s decision-making on immigration and law enforcement. Security concerns among Republicans and other public officials ramped up after Mr. Kirk’s killing at a public event in Utah, after which Mr. Miller vowed to punish liberal activists and networks that he has cast as terrorists.\n\n“The organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people’s addresses, combining that with messaging that’s designed to trigger, incite violence in the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence: It is a vast domestic terror movement,” Mr. Miller said on Mr. Kirk’s podcast shortly after his death.\n\n“With God as my witness,” he continued, “we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.”\n\nMr. Haywood said that Ms. Wien and her fellow Arlington activists were only engaged in peaceful advocacy and not seeking to coerce, intimidate or harass Mr. Miller.\n\n“They were speaking truth to power, and that is really at the core of our Constitution,” he said. “It’s a principle and a right that our country was founded on.”\n\nWhile much of the legal battle played out in sealed court filings, originally at the request of Mr. Haywood, he reversed course in mid-October, noting that the dispute over leaflets and chalk messages had been the subject of local news coverage.\n\n“All that remains confidential is the fact that law enforcement may be conducting an unconstitutional investigation into those who participated in these advocacy efforts,” Mr. Haywood wrote.\n\nAccording to the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant for Ms. Wien’s cellphone, the case began in August, when Mr. Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, complained to the police about a leaflet that had been posted in her neighborhood.\n\n“She informed responding officers that similar fliers had been observed in multiple parks throughout the neighborhood,” the affidavit said.\n\nThe flier declared Mr. Miller was “wanted for crimes against humanity,” and included his home address, according to a photograph of the leaflet included in the affidavit. “No Nazis in NOVA,” it said, using an acronym for Northern Virginia. The flier also urged people to scan a QR code to “demand a congressional investigation.”\n\nMrs. Miller told the police, and Secret Service security camera footage appeared to confirm, that at one point she noticed Ms. Wien walking to the front door of a neighboring home, court papers said. According to the affidavit, Mrs. Miller saw Ms. Wien make a gesture “by pointing her index and middle fingers to her own eyes and then pointing directly at Mrs. Miller.”\n\n“Mrs. Miller interpreted this gesture to mean, ‘I’m watching you,’ and perceived it as a threatening act intended to intimidate or harass her,” the affidavit said. “Based on the timing, context and manner of the gesture, the action is being treated as a potential act of intimidation in furtherance of the conduct under investigation.”\n\nA state police agent, in seeking Ms. Wien’s cellphone, told her that she was being investigated for a possible violation of a Virginia state law that makes it a misdemeanor to publish a person’s name or photograph along with identifying information “with the intent to coerce, intimidate or harass another person,” according to court documents.\n\nMr. Haywood, in court papers, argued that Secret Service agents have gathered evidence showing Ms. Wien had not violated the law. “She made crystal clear that, to the extent that she had been active in protests against the Trump administration, she has never sought to intimidate, coerce, or harass anyone, but rather, to express her strong disapproval of those in leadership who have directed a campaign of oppression against immigrants and other vulnerable members of our community,” the filing said.\n\n“Through this investigation, it is impossible to reach any conclusion other than that Ms. Wien poses no risk of harm to Stephen or Katie Miller — even if harm is as minor as ‘coercion’ or ‘harassment,’” Mr. Haywood wrote in a filing.\n\nAccording to the affidavit for the search warrant, the police in neighboring Fairfax County had acquired a text message Ms. Wien sent to a WhatsApp group in April. It asserted that Mr. Miller, “the evil fascist behind family separations and deportation policies,” had moved into Arlington. It is unclear how or why the Fairfax police had access to communications in that group chat.\n\n“His wife sits their smugly swilling wine on their patio, while her husband orders the arrest of more and more of our Muslim, Arab American, and Hispanic brothers and sisters,” Ms. Wien wrote, according to the affidavit. “My Showing Up For Racial Justice (SURJ) chapter in N. Virginia intends to make his life hell. We have set up a carefully vetted Signal group.”\n\nThat language, the Virginia State Police officer wrote, “clearly demonstrates an intent to threaten, intimidate, coerce or harass Mr. Miller.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the legal fight broadened into a battle over jurisdiction, with the county prosecutor handling the case accusing the state’s attorney general of trying to usurp her authority.\n\nWhen the top prosecutor in Arlington, Parisa Dehghani-Tafti, learned that federal agents had accompanied the local police to execute the warrant, she took the rare step of filing her own motion arguing that additional limits should be placed on what parts of Ms. Wien’s phone could be searched.\n\nThe judge overseeing the matter then ordered the state police to pause its investigation of the phone while she considered the legal issues involved.\n\nAsked for comment, Ms. Dehghani-Tafti said the matter remained pending, “so I am limited in what I can say, but our office believes in the rule of law.”\n\nShe added, “I believe in the First Amendment, and in order to maintain the public trust we have to act with integrity no matter who is a potential target or potential victim, and the rule of law encompasses both prosecuting fairly and protecting constitutional rights.”\n\nAfter her office weighed in, the state attorney general tried to intervene, arguing that the judge’s pause was unfair to the state police. “The Virginia state police cannot comply with their statutory obligations and simultaneously comply with the court’s order,” wrote Theophani K. Stamos, a deputy to Virginia’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, a Republican.\n\nThe involvement of the state attorney general’s office also thrust local politics into the dispute. Ms. Stamos had served as the top prosecutor in Arlington until she lost a Democratic primary to Ms. Dehghani-Tafti in 2019.\n\nMs. Dehghani-Tafti fired back sharply, accusing the state attorney general’s office of misstating the facts of the case.\n\nShe urged the judge to disregard Mr. Miyares’s request, saying that “concerns about individual privacy and potential infringement on First Amendment rights” should be balanced against the importance of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe state attorney general, she argued, had no jurisdiction to weigh in on a misdemeanor investigation. Doing so now, she added, was part of what she described as a larger pattern by Mr. Miyares’s office of trying to push the bounds of the criminal justice system.\n\nMs. Dehghani-Tafti accused the attorney general’s office of trying to “willfully ignore the constitutional rights of the citizens of the commonwealth in hopes that they will receive some relief later.” She added, “That is not justice.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vn17r29v9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"00:42:27.613+00:00","title":"Sudan conflict: Who is RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagolo?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagolo, the leader of Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has emerged as a dominant and controversial figure in Sudan’s ongoing conflict.

is RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagolo?\n\nMohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as \"Hemedti\", has emerged as a dominant figure on Sudan's political stage, with his paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) now controlling half of the country.\n\nThe RSF scored a notable victory recently when it overran the city of el-Fasher, the last garrison held by the Sudanese army and its local allies in the western region of Darfur.\n\nFeared and loathed by his adversaries, Hemedti is admired by his followers for his tenacity, ruthlessness, and his promise to tear down a discredited state.\n\nHemedti has humble origins. His family is from the Mahariya section of the camel-herding, Arabic-speaking Rizeigat community that spans Chad and Darfur.\n\nHe was born in 1974 or 1975 - like many from a rural background, his date and place of birth were not registered.\n\nLed by his uncle Juma Dagolo, his clan moved into Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, fleeing war and seeking greener pastures and were allowed to settle.\n\nAfter dropping out of school in his early teens, Hemedti earned money trading camels across the desert to Libya and Egypt.\n\nAt the time, Darfur was Sudan's wild west - poor, lawless and neglected by the government of then-President Omar al-Bashir.\n\nArab militiamen known as the Janjaweed - including a force commanded by Juma Dagolo - were attacking the villages of the indigenous Fur ethnic group.\n\nThis cycle of violence led to a full-scale rebellion in 2003, in which Fur fighters were joined by Masalit, Zaghawa and other groups, saying they had been ignored by the country's Arab elite.\n\nIn response, Bashir massively expanded the Janjaweed to spearhead his counter-insurgency efforts. They quickly won notoriety for burning, looting, raping and killing.\n\nHemedti's unit was among them, with a report by African Union peacekeepers saying it attacked and destroyed the village of Adwa in November 2004, killing 126 people, including 36 children.\n\nA US investigation determined that the Janjaweed were responsible for genocide.\n\nThe Darfur conflict was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which brought charges against four men, including Bashir, who has denied carrying out genocide.\n\nHemedti was one of the many Janjaweed commanders deemed too junior to be in the prosecutor's sights at that time.\n\nJust one, the Janjaweed \"colonel of colonels\", Ali Abdel Rahman Kushayb, was brought to court.\n\nLast month he was found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and he will be sentenced on 19 November.\n\nIn the years following the height of the violence in 2004, Hemedti played his cards skilfully, rising to become head of a powerful paramilitary force, a corporate empire, and a political machine.\n\nIt is a story of opportunism and entrepreneurship. He briefly mutinied, demanding back-pay for his soldiers, promotions and a political position for his brother. Bashir gave him most of what he wanted and Hemedti rejoined the fold.\n\nLater, when other Janjaweed units mutinied, Hemedti led the government forces that defeated them, in the process taking control of Darfur's biggest artisanal gold mine at a place called Jebel Amir.\n\nRapidly, Hemedti's family company Al-Gunaid became Sudan's largest gold exporter.\n\nIn 2013, Hemedti asked - and got - formal status as head of a new paramilitary group, the RSF, reporting directly to Bashir.\n\nThe Janjaweed were folded into the RSF, getting new uniforms, vehicles and weapons - and also officers from the regular army who were brought in to help with the upgrade.\n\nThe RSF scored an important victory against the Darfur rebels, did less well in fighting an insurgency in the Nuba Mountains adjacent to South Sudan, and took a subcontract to police the border with Libya.\n\nOstensibly curbing illicit migration from Africa over the desert to the Mediterranean, Hemedti's commanders also excelled in extortion and, reportedly, people-trafficking.\n\nIn 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called on the Sudanese army to send troops to fight against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe contingent was commanded by a general who had fought in Darfur, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, now the head of the army at war with the RSF.\n\nHemedti saw a chance and negotiated a separate, private deal with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE to provide RSF mercenaries.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi connection proved most consequential. It was the beginning of a close relationship with the Emirati president, Mohamed bin Zayed\n\nYoung Sudanese men - and increasingly from neighbouring countries too - trekked to the RSF recruiting centres for cash payments of up to $6,000 (£4,500) on signing up.\n\nHemedti struck a partnership with Russia's Wagner Group, receiving training in return for commercial dealings, including in gold.\n\nHe visited Moscow to formalise the deal, and was there on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. After the war in Sudan broke out, he denied the RSF was getting help from Wagner.\n\nAlthough the RSF's main combat units were increasingly professionalised, it also encompassed a coalition of irregular old-style ethnic militia.\n\nAs the regime faced mounting popular protests, Bashir ordered Hemedti's units to the capital, Khartoum.\n\nPunning on his name, the president dubbed him himayti, \"my protector\", seeing the RSF as a counterweight to potential coup makers in the regular army and national security.\n\nIt was a miscalculation. In April 2019, a vibrant camp of civic protesters surrounded the military headquarters demanding democracy.\n\nBashir ordered the army to open fire on them. The top generals - Hemedti among them - met and decided to depose Bashir instead. The democracy movement celebrated.\n\nFor a time, Hemedti was lionised as the fresh face of Sudan's future. Youthful, personable, actively meeting diverse social groups, and positioning himself as the challenger to the country's historic establishment, he tried to change his political colours. That lasted just a few weeks.\n\nAs he and the joint head of the ruling military council, Burhan, stalled on handing power to civilians, the protesters stepped up their rallies, and Hemedti unleashed the RSF, which killed hundreds of people, raped women, and  threw men into the River Nile with bricks tied to their ankles, according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) .\n\nHemedti has denied the RSF committed atrocities.\n\nPressed by the quartet of countries formed to promote peace and democracy in Sudan - the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - the generals and the civilians agreed to a compromise drafted by African mediators.\n\nFor two years, there was an unstable coexistence of a military-dominated sovereign council and a civilian cabinet.\n\nAs a cabinet-appointed committee investigating the companies owned by the army, security and RSF closed in on its final report - which was set to expose how Hemedti was fast expanding his corporate empire - Burhan and Hemedti dismissed the civilians and took power.\n\nBut the coup-masters fell out. Burhan demanded that the RSF come under army command.\n\nHemedti resisted. Days before a deadline in April 2023  to resolve this issue, RSF units moved to surround the army headquarters and seize key bases and the national palace in Khartoum.\n\nThe putsch failed. Instead, Khartoum became a war zone as the rival forces fought street by street.\n\nViolence exploded in Darfur, with RSF units mounting a vicious campaign against the Masalit people.\n\nThe UN estimates as many as 15,000 civilians died, and the US described it as genocide. The RSF denied the allegation.\n\nRSF commanders circulated videos of their fighters torturing and killing, advertising the atrocities and their sense of impunity.\n\nThe RSF and its allied militia rampaged across Sudan, pillaging cities, markets, universities, and hospitals.\n\nAn avalanche of looted goods are for sale in what are popularly known as \"Dagolo markets\" reaching beyond Sudan into Chad and other neighbouring countries. The RSF has denied its fighters are involved in looting.\n\nTrapped in the national palace under attack from artillery and airstrikes, Hemedti was badly injured in the early weeks of the conflict and disappeared from public view.\n\nWhen he reappeared months later he showed no remorse for atrocities and was no less determined to win the war on the battlefield.\n\nThe RSF has acquired modern weapons including sophisticated drones, that it has used to strike Burhan's de facto capital, Port Sudan, and which played a crucial role in the assault on el-Fasher.\n\nInvestigative reporting by, among others, the New York Times, has documented that these are transported through an airstrip and supply base built by the UAE just inside Chad. The UAE denies that it is arming the RSF.\n\nWith this weaponry, the RSF is locked in a strategic stalemate with its former partner, the Sudanese army.\n\nHemedti is trying to build a political coalition, including some civilian groups and armed movements, most notably his former adversaries in the Nuba Mountains.\n\nHe has formed a parallel \"Government of Peace and Unity\", taking the chairmanship for himself.\n\nWith the capture of el-Fasher, the RSF now controls almost all the inhabited territory west of the Nile.\n\nFollowing escalating reports of mass killings and widespread condemnation,  Hemedti declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers  during the taking of the city.\n\nSudanese speculate that Hemedti sees himself either as president of a breakaway state, or still harbours ambitions to rule all of Sudan.\n\nIt's also possible that he sees a future as an all-powerful political puppet master, head of a conglomerate that controls businesses, a mercenary army and a political party. By these means, even if he isn't acceptable as Sudan's public face, he can still pull the strings.\n\nAnd as Hemedti's troops massacre civilians in el-Fasher, he is confident that he enjoys impunity in a world that does not care much.\n\nAlex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"}]}
