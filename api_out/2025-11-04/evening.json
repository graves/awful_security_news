major response from Democrats against  unprecedented Republican efforts , led by President Donald Trump, to redraw congressional maps this year to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/jared-isaacman-nasa-trump-nomination-withdrawal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump Again Taps Tech Billionaire Jared Isaacman to Lead NASA After Previously Pulling Nomination","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has re-nominated tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, a two-time space traveler and close associate of Elon Musk, to lead NASA, reversing a previous withdrawal that stemmed from political tensions and concerns over his past political donations.

billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA after previously pulling nomination \n       \n  By Alejandra Jaramillo, Kristen Holmes, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:22 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump is nominating tech billionaire Jared Isaacman for a second time to serve as administrator of NASA, he announced on social media Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, an Elon Musk associate who has twice traveled to space on private SpaceX missions, was  previously tapped for the position  before Trump unexpectedly  withdrew his nomination  earlier this year, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”\n \n\n   \n  “This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that Trump and Isaacman reopened lines of communication over the summer and it soon became clear to officials that Isaacman was not only back in the mix to lead NASA, but a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the president’s post, Isaacman thanked Trump and pledged to uphold the agency’s mission to “inspire the world once again.”’\n \n\n   \n  “To the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond–these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age– and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement came as some Trump officials have in recent weeks expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has been serving as NASA’s acting administrator, with internal wrangling over who will lead the agency spilling into public view, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy had said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently and fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the secretary told CNN he said that “NASA might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but denied Duffy said he wanted to keep the NASA administrator job.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy on Tuesday congratulated Isaacman on his nomination and praised the work the agency has done under his interim leadership.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made giant leaps in our mission to return to the Moon before China. It’s critical for our national security and national pride that we win the next space race,” he said on X. “Congratulations to  @rookisaacman  . I wish him all the success and will ensure the transition is seamless.”\n \n\n   \n  The abrupt withdrawal of Isaacman earlier this year left a bad taste in the mouths of many within the White House, with some pointing fingers at a top Trump aide for convincing the president that Isaacman’s past Democratic donations disqualified him.\n \n\n   \n  That frustration only grew when the decision was announced as Trump and Musk kicked off a messy, monthslong feud.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN previously  reported , Sergio Gor, a longtime Trump ally, moved to oust Isaacman after Musk left his brief, unofficial role in Washington several months ago, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s departure, which came when he was presumably days away from being confirmed for the NASA job by the Senate, was an act of retribution against Musk who had “rubbed a couple people wrong,” the source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    NASA’s looming moon race\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s reinstatement comes as NASA is headed for a crucial few years. The space agency is racing to return astronauts to the moon amid a geopolitical standoff with China, which aims to send its taikonauts there by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s moon landing plan, called Artemis, is currently at an inflection point. Recently, Duffy suggested he and the space agency may  sideline  SpaceX from its roster of private-sector partners for the lunar touchdown mission, called Artemis III.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy’s team said it intended to send a “Request for Information,” or RFI, to the space industry when the government shutdown concludes. The request would ask companies to detail how they may rapidly produce a lunar lander vehicle and get NASA astronauts to the moon quicker than SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if NASA will move forward with the RFI. Isaacman is viewed as a close ally of Musk and SpaceX, though he has emphasized that he intends to foster competition across the commercial space industry as head of NASA.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman would also take on the top job as NASA’s workforce is showing signs of discontent amid job cuts and looming budget reductions — including a proposed 47% cut to the agency’s science budget mapped out in Trump’s budget request earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has called those proposed cuts suboptimal.\n \n\n   \n  During an April  confirmation hearing , Isaacman faced wide-ranging questions about how NASA’s priorities might change under his leadership and signaled an interest in Mars — the longtime focus of Musk and SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman faced questioning from national security hawks who raised concerns that relinquishing NASA’s focus on the moon could cede ground to China. In response, Isaacman had struck a conciliatory tone, saying, “We don’t have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  After the confirmation hearing, Isaacman’s remarks were met with praise throughout the space industry — as well as skepticism about how NASA would pay for such bold ambitions as the Trump administration seeks to tighten federal spending.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/prop-50-passes-california-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00.000-05:00","title":"California Approves Prop 50: Redistricting Measure to Create More Democrat-Friendly House Districts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters are projected to approve Proposition 50, a redistricting initiative championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, which allows Democrats to redraw congressional maps to create five more favorable districts for their party.

Newsom argued that the ballot measure, Proposition 50, was necessary for Democrats to “fight fire with fire.”\n \n\n   \n  Proposition 50’s passage is a personal success for Newsom, a term-limited governor who has positioned himself as one of the president’s most aggressive adversaries ahead of a possible 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom invested significant political capital betting that voters would be willing to undermine the state’s independent redistricting commission to push back against the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The governor made himself the face of the campaign, appearing in ads and teasing at his political future to boost donations. His ballot measure committee raised more than $100 million, far surpassing the amount raised and spent by the opposition.\n \n\n   \n  That bet has paid off.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican-led effort against the measure was fractured. Wealthy GOP donor  Charles Munger Jr.,  who bankrolled the constitutional amendments that created the independent redistricting commission, poured more than $30 million of his own money into the effort to block Proposition 50. While Munger targeted independent voters and good government-minded Democrats, the California Republican Party and a group led by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy worked to boost GOP turnout. But McCarthy’s efforts to raise money  fell well short  of what he privately told Republicans to expect.\n \n\n   \n  Former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger  also came out against Proposition 50 , urging Californians to “terminate gerrymandering.” Newsom met privately with the former governor earlier this year and described him as a friend and colleague.\n \n\n   \n  “We share many of the same values, we certainly share many of the same concerns about the current occupant in the White House,” Newsom told reporters in August.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats made Trump a central part of the campaign in a bid to politicize the race and take advantage of their party’s roughly 20-point voter registration advantage over Republicans. Republicans, meanwhile, focused on Newsom, arguing that the ballot initiative was an effort to boost his future political ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Opponents of Proposition 50 argued that the measure was a Democratic power grab, and that voters already voted more than a decade ago to strip lawmakers of the right to draw congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new maps, which will be in place through the 2030 election, five Republican incumbents have been drawn into bluer districts. Several Democratic candidates have already announced challenges in anticipation of the more favorable lines.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/exit-polls-nyc-nj-virginia-california-elections","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-05:00","title":"CNN exit polls: Voters’ dissatisfaction with Trump helped fuel Democratic wins in key races","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, CNN exit polls reveal that despite Donald Trump's return to office, widespread voter dissatisfaction with his performance and policies continues to drive Democratic victories in key races.

A year later, preliminary CNN exit polling finds, the first  major electoral tests  of the second Trump presidency take place with voters expressing similar pessimism and anti-incumbent sentiments despite the turnover in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Across four  closely watched contests  — the governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey, the mayoral race in New York City and the redistricting-related Proposition 50 in California — majorities disapprove of Trump, with strong disapproval of his performance far outpacing strong approval. In Virginia, New Jersey and California, roughly half or more of the electorate sees their vote as sending a  message to Trump . And that message is largely one of opposition, rather than support. That message is largely one of opposition, rather than support, and it helped to propel Democratic gubernatorial wins by Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Democrat Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City’s mayoral race, meanwhile, may owe more to local concerns about issues like cost of living. But it reflects a loss for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom  Trump endorsed at the last minute .\n \n\n   \n  While all these places voted Democratic in last year’s presidential election, none currently give especially positive reviews to the Democratic Party. The party’s favorability rating hovers around the 50% mark in California and New York City — though the GOP is even more unpopular in those places. In New Jersey and Virginia, voters rated Sherrill and Spanberger more positively than their Republican rivals, but gave roughly equal ratings to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party overall.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Exit Polls are from the Voter Poll conducted by SSRS, which combines thousands of pre-election interviews with those conducted at polling places to reflect the opinions of the full electorate. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results. Learn more about how this year’s surveys were conducted  here .\n \n\n   \n  Even in a political environment with sharply national overtones, tonight’s results also reflect factors deeply specific to each election. Here’s a closer look at each of these key races:\n \n\n   \n    Virginia\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, Spanberger’s victory in the governor’s race was powered in significant part by unhappiness with the state of the nation. A majority of voters said they disapproved of Trump — and roughly 9 in 10 of those voters supported Spanberger over her rival, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  Closer to home, voters give Glenn Youngkin, the state’s outgoing Republican governor, majority approval. But Earle-Sears wasn’t able to hold onto enough of his supporters: Roughly one-quarter of voters who think he did a good job as governor still backed Spanberger to succeed him.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a similar pattern when it comes to key issues in the state. While about half of voters said that societal support for transgender rights has gone too far, more than one-fifth in that group still support Spanberger over Earle-Sears, who made attacks on transgender rights a cornerstone of her campaign. By contrast, just over half of voters also say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far — and Spanberger is winning around 9 in 10 of them.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger won among voters who identify as political independents — a group that makes up roughly a third of this year’s electorate — and among female voters, voters with college degrees and the majority of voters in the state who say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. She also notched a significant advantage among voters from households where someone worked this year as a federal employee or was employed as a federal contractor.\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears did win among the roughly 45% of voters who say that  texts sent  by Democratic state attorney general nominee Jay Jones are disqualifying — although Spanberger did get the votes of about 20% in that group. Spanberger denounced the texts but did not call for Jones to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  Downballot, about 45% of voters said that  texts sent  by Jones were disqualifying, with 35% calling them concerning but not disqualifying or describing them as not a concern, and 17% saying they hadn’t heard enough to say. Jones also won his race, as did the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Ghazala Hashmi.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory over Republican Jack Ciattarelli took place in the shadow of two unpopular incumbents: Trump’s approval rating stands at about 44% among voters in the state who turned out Tuesday night, with the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also seeing an approval rating that’s slightly underwater.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors map closely onto Tuesday’s race: Roughly 9 in 10 voters who disapprove of Trump cast their vote for Sherrill, while roughly 8 in 10 who disapprove of Murphy are now backing a Republican to replace him.\n \n\n   \n  The lion’s share of Ciattarelli’s supporters — nearly half — say it was most important to them to pick the candidate who’ll bring needed change, while Sherrill voters largely say they were looking for a candidate who’s honest or trustworthy, will work for people like them, or shares their values. Sherrill’s favorability rating is modestly higher than Ciatarrelli’s, and more than half say her campaign against him was mostly fair, while voters are split on the fairness of Ciattarelli’s campaign. But Ciattarelli’s supporters are likelier than Sherrill’s to say that their vote was mostly for their chosen candidate, rather than out of opposition to their rival.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 7 in 10 voters say that property tax rates are a major problem where they live, and about 6 in 10 say the same of electricity costs. More than half also call political corruption in the state a major problem.\n \n\n   \n  Most voters who call the economy or health care the top issue in the state are backing Sherrill, while voters who are more focused on taxes or immigration largely support Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n    New York City\n \n\n   \n  New York City’s multi-candidate  mayoral race  was marked by some sharp demographic divides.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won with a coalition that included majority support among voters younger than 45, college graduates, first-time voters and renters. He also won most of the city’s Democratic voters.\n \n\n   \n  Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo won a majority of Jewish voters. He also outpaced Mamdani among older voters, those without a college degree and those born in the city but fell short of a majority among any of those groups. Independents in the city, meanwhile, were closely split between Mamdani and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  There were also big differences between the bases of support for Mamdani and Cuomo. Nearly 90% of Mamdani’s supporters say their vote is to support him, rather than to oppose his rivals. (Republican Curtis Sliwa’s voters also saw their ballot as a statement of support.) By contrast, Cuomo’s voters are closely split between voting to support him and voting to oppose the other candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani voters overwhelmingly called cost of living the top issue facing the city, while Cuomo voters were divided between cost of living and crime. And a plurality of Mamdani’s supporters say it was most important either that their candidate would bring needed change, while Cuomo’s supporters broadly say they were looking for the candidate with the right experience.\n \n\n   \n  Although most voters say they’re holding steady or getting ahead financially, nearly 60% call cost of living the city’s most important issue. And more than 7 in 10 say the cost of housing where they live is a major problem, compared to just about one-third who say crime is a major problem. About 4 in 10 call the candidates’ positions on Israel a major factor in their vote.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won a majority of that big swath of voters who said they were highly concerned with housing costs, while those highly concerned about the candidates’ positions on Israel split about evenly between him and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California\n \n\n   \n  Voters in California are weighing a measure with national implications: Proposition 50, a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven  redistricting in other states . Roughly 7 in 10 say it’s very important to them which party controls Congress.\n \n\n   \n  An overwhelming majority of voters say they’d generally prefer state congressional district lines to be drawn by a non-partisan commission than the party in power. But those voting “yes” on the measure also broadly see it as a response to GOP-led redistricting elsewhere: around 80% say they see it as a way to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than the best way of drawing congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, about half of California voters say that neither party is handling the redrawing of congressional district lines fairly, with the rest more likely to say that only the Democrats are taking a fair approach than that only the Republicans are.\n \n\n   \n  Around three-quarters of California voters say they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and about half say they view their vote as a way to oppose Trump. More than 6 in 10 say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far, and most say the governor should not cooperate with the Trump administration on its efforts. A majority also oppose the idea of the federal government sending the National Guard into major cities in California.\n \n\n   \n  More than 80% say that the cost of living in their area is unaffordable, and the economy far outpaces immigration, health care, crime or climate change as the top issue facing the state.\n \n\n   \n   The CNN Voter Poll conducted by SSRS was conducted from October 22nd -November 4th, and includes representative samples of voters in California, New Jersey and New York City. The Voter Poll combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts each in Virginia and New York City and from 29 precincts in New Jersey. Respondents could complete the poll in English or Spanish. The overall margin of sampling error for voters, accounting for design effects, is expected to be approximately plus or minus 2.0 percentage points in California, 2.1 percentage points in New Jersey, 2.2 percentage points in New York City, and 2.1 percentage points in Virginia. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/election-takeaways-new-york-new-jersey-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:32:00-05:00","title":"Takeaways from Tuesday’s elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Tuesday’s U.S. elections, Democrats achieved sweeping victories across multiple states, rejecting President Donald Trump’s administration and signaling a deepening ideological divide within the party.

Abigail Spanberger  turned in the strongest Democratic performance in the state’s recent history as she coasted to victory. And in New Jersey, another moderate, Rep.  Mikie Sherrill , busted apart the coalition Trump and her Republican rival, former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli, had put together to close the Garden State’s gap in recent elections.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, democratic socialist  Zohran Mamdani’s win  marked the second time this year he’d defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo — first in the Democratic primary, and then in the general election, with Cuomo running as an independent backed by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic wins by candidates with sharp ideological differences will do little to settle the party’s long-raging internal debate about its way forward, with a host of competitive midterm primaries just months away and the 2028 presidential primary already looming.\n \n\n   \n  But their campaigns had some things in common. Though their solutions were different, the candidates focused on the issue of affordability. And they were all fiercely critical of Trump’s performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just a message about Democrats; it’s a message about our entire country. I think Americans are appalled by what they are seeing coming out of this administration,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN from Mamdani’s victory party.\n \n\n   \n  In California,  voters approved  a redistricting ballot measure intended to boost Democrats’ chances in next year’s battle for control of the House. And in Pennsylvania, Democratic state Supreme Court justices won their retention votes, allowing Democrats to keep their majority on the high court in a perennial battleground state where legal challenges over voting rules are all but certain.\n \n\n   \n  Here are five initial takeaways from Tuesday’s elections:\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani defeats Cuomo — again\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani drew immense national attention over his progressive ideology and his courtship of voters who were eager for a fresh face. But in New York City, his relentless focus on driving down costs might have proven more persuasive — and voters were on course to give his forthcoming efforts a boost by also approving a series of ballot measures intended to reduce red tape on building affordable housing.\n \n\n   \n  If he delivers on his promises, it would turn New York City into a blueprint for cities across the country where the cost of living has soared. If Mamdani fails, he could be used as a warning against progressives more broadly as the 2028 presidential primary approaches.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, who was attempting a political comeback after resigning from the governor’s office in 2021, the outcome was an embarrassment. It was also a failure for Trump, who late in the race supported Cuomo rather than Republican Curtis Sliwa, saying Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time.”\n \n\n   \n    A big suburban swing\n \n\n   \n  The first big win for Democrats on Tuesday came in Virginia, where Spanberger, a former CIA officer who had won a competitive congressional district in 2018 and held it until retiring this year to focus on the governor’s race, pulled away from Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  One window into her dominance came in Loudoun County — a closely-watched mix of suburbs and exurbs in Northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  With most of the expected vote counted there at 9 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday, Spanberger had more than 64% of the vote there. That was 8 percentage points better than former Vice President Kamala Harris did in the 2024 presidential election, and 9 points better than the party’s losing 2021 gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe. Spanberger was nearly 5 points ahead of former Gov. Ralph Northam’s performance in Loudoun County in 2017 — a big Democratic win in Trump’s first term that presaged the party’s strong 2018 midterm performance.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger outperformed recent Democratic candidates across the map in Virginia, likely fueled in part by the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Thousands of current and former federal workers live throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s exit poll found that Spanberger won 61% of the vote of those who have a federal worker or federal contractor in their household, compared to 52% support from those who do not.\n \n\n   \n  Her margins were large enough to pull Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general who was rocked by the disclosure of text messages in which he suggested a former legislative colleague should be shot, across the finish line, even though he lagged Spanberger by about 5 points. Jones defeated Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n    A barrier falls in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  No matter the outcome, Virginia’s election was going to make history: The winner would become the first woman to serve as its governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that history, relaying to supporters that her husband had told their children that their mother would become the governor of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I can guarantee, those words have never been spoken in Virginia before,” she said. “It’s a big deal that the girls and young women I have met along the campaign trail now know with certainty they can achieve anything.”\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey reveals anti-Trump sentiment\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, candidate quality was a factor in the outcome, as Republicans grumbled for months about their nominee, Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey was a different story.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli had a strong statewide performance under his belt after his near-miss in the 2021 governor’s race. He also had his own brand — a “Jersey guy” appeal that he hoped would give him some separation from Trump, despite the president’s endorsement, Ciattarelli’s praise for his performance in office and Democrats’ relentless advertising campaign tying him to Trump in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, those realities made New Jersey the better barometer of anti-Trump sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  One key question was whether Ciattarelli could replicate Trump’s performance with Latino voters: They swung hard in the GOP’s favor nationally last November, with the president winning 46% support to Harris’ 51% with Latinos, CNN’s exit poll found. On Tuesday in New Jersey, the answer was no: Sherrill won 64% of Latino voters to Ciattarelli’s 32%, per CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n  She also won 91% of Black voters. And she won independents by a 7-point margin. Moderates backed Sherrill, 58% to 39%.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli won handily among the 34% of voters who said taxes was the most important issue facing New Jersey. But 32% said the economy — which Republicans had hoped would be a strength, since the state is currently controlled by Democrats — was the most important issue, and those voters backed Sherrill, 61% to 37%, according to CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n    Newsom’s big redistricting moment\n \n\n   \n  California voters gave Democrats’ hopes of winning a House majority in next year’s midterms a massive boost on Tuesday — and gave Gov. Gavin Newsom  a signature moment  on the national stage, demonstrating to Democratic voters that he can stand up to Trump ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s voters approved a ballot measure that would scrap the current congressional district boundaries drawn by an independent commission in favor of new maps that would hand Democrats five more favorable districts.\n \n\n   \n  The mid-decade redistricting is Newsom’s answer to Texas, which redrew its maps in an effort to hand the GOP five more winnable districts at Trump’s behest as the president searched for ways to retain the GOP’s narrow House majority next year.\n \n\n   \n  Amid a short but pitched advertising battle ahead of the vote, Newsom made himself the face of the redistricting effort. He raised $108 million for the effort, and appeared in advertisements backing it. He pitched it in a series of interviews and podcast appearances.\n \n\n   \n  “With Prop 50, The Election Rigging Response Act, we can stop Trump cold,” Newsom said in one spot, standing in front of an American flag. National audiences may be seeing him a lot more in the years to come.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/spanberger-sherrill-roommates-similar-paths-to-office","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-05:00","title":"Spanberger and Sherrill Make History as First Female Governors in Virginia and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, former roommates and U.S. representatives who ran as centrist Democrats in 2018, have made history by becoming the first female governors of Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.

They’re now making history in their states \n       \n  By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six years ago,  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  were roommates and freshmen members of Congress, part of a record-breaking wave of women who helped Democrats win back the US House.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the two made history once more. CNN projected that Spanberger will be Virginia’s first female governor and Sherrill will be the first Democratic woman elected as governor of New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Their wins come at a time when Democrats are navigating difficult questions over who the next leaders of the party should be and what messages will work to win over voters who shifted toward President Donald Trump last year.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill’s victories offer at least one path forward for Democrats. Both ran aggressively on affordability issues and promises to lower health care, housing and utility costs. It appears to have resonated with voters: Spanberger and Sherrill both surpassed the total number of votes their predecessors won in 2021 before votes were fully tallied in their states.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” Spanberger told supporters at her election night rally. “We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, a former CIA officer, and Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, both won Republican-held seats in 2018 by running as national security-minded centrists. In Congress, they – along with Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and former Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia – formed the Mod Squad, a more centrist version of the progressive Squad.\n \n\n   \n  Years after they ran and won their first races, the two newest members of the Democratic Governors Association will enter this next phase of their careers side-by-side as well. Spanberger described the feeling of running in one of this year’s few competitive races alongside her friend as “amusing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Being able to compare notes has been fun,” she told CNN recently. “But I think what I’m most excited about is just — I know what I’m about to say sounds cheesy, but I mean it sincerely — how hardworking she is … I think there will be some really interesting value in thinking through different issues or different challenges because we’re aligned in many places, but we get to the same place from different directions.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, moved in with each other after growing tired of living on Capitol Hill on their own. The pair ate dinner off Sherrill’s gold-rimmed wedding china and sat on a two-decade-old couch Spanberger brought out of storage,  they told the Washington Post last year .\n \n\n   \n  They’re both eldest of three girls. They both have multiple children – Spanberger has three kids, Sherrill has four. The Virginia governor-elect was born in New Jersey, while the incoming New Jersey governor grew up in northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since,”  Sherrill told CNN last month .\n \n\n   \n  During a campaign event this summer, Spanberger told reporters they were both eager to meet voters across their districts when they challenged longtime incumbent Republicans in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “I maintain my friendship with her, so I know a bit about what she’s been doing across the campaign trail, and she’s been traveling everywhere in New Jersey,” Spanberger said. “The common thread is that we’re relentlessly focused on the issues that people across our communities bring to us.”\n \n\n   \n  After their races were called, the two governors-elect also reflected on the historic nature of their wins. Sherrill mentioned “the little girls who come up to me and say they’re going to be a governor, or they’re going to be a president.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that her husband had told their three daughters minutes earlier that their mother would be the state’s next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “And I can guarantee that those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before,” she said. “The history Virginia is making tonight is yours.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/college-football-playoff-rankings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-05:00","title":"Ohio State tops first College Football Playoff rankings but nothing is settled","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The College Football Playoff rankings released in early November 2025 show Ohio State at the top, with Indiana, Texas A&M, and Alabama receiving first-round byes.

November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First the disclaimer: it’s early November. There is no need to overreact.\n \n\n   \n  Well, let’s be serious. The entire purpose of releasing the  College Football Playoff  rankings 33 days before it counts is to encourage fomenting, handwringing and angst.\n \n\n   \n  What else are we supposed to do? Let it play out, for heaven’s sake? How rational. How dull.\n \n\n   \n  There would be neither armchairs from which to quarterback nor watercoolers from which to debate if we simply opted to wait and see. Besides, this is college football, where  governors  insert themselves into the decision making. Melodrama reigns.\n \n\n   \n  Were the season to end tomorrow, the rankings released on Tuesday night combined with the rules - the five highest-ranked conference champions make the 12-team field via a straight seed model - would mean  Ohio State ,  Indiana , Texas A&M and Alabama would receive first-round byes. The first-round games would feature Memphis at Georgia, Virginia at Ole Miss, Notre Dame at BYU and Oregon at Texas Tech.\n \n\n   \n  So have at it. Screech your outrage, ACC schools disrespected by just one bid and pound your shoes on a desk somewhere, Notre Dame haters, especially those in the commonwealth of Kentucky and in the sunny setting of Miami.\n \n\n   \n  The Irish have two losses, Louisville has one and one of the two Notre Dame Ls came at the hands of Miami, which the Cardinals beat. (There has to be a transitive theory argument in there somewhere.) The Hurricanes, in the meantime, also have two losses and beat Notre Dame and they are a very distant 18th in the standings.\n \n\n   \n  Then exhale because there are, to paraphrase Robert Frost, still miles to go before we sleep on this college football season.\n \n\n   \n  The actual bracket will be created on December 7 and if this sport has taught us anything this season, things escalate quickly.\n \n\n   \n  It was, in fact, just one month ago to the day that Penn State made Jerry Neuheisel look like the second coming of Bear Bryant, losing to UCLA and beginning a downward spiral that  cost a coach his job , the school millions and has no signs of finding rock bottom just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Because, to borrow from another great poet - one Theodor Geisel - these first rankings ought to come with a dramatic reading of ‘Oh, the Places You’ll Go!’ It is not entirely about where you start, as where you might end up.\n \n\n   \n  From the next great QB to the next big bust, Arch Manning has found something of a sweet spot of normalcy, having steered Texas to wins against Oklahoma and Vanderbilt in the last month. With Georgia, Arkansas and Texas A&M left on the docket, the Longhorns can make their own case.\n \n\n   \n  Georgia Tech is similarly on the outside looking in, currently sitting at No. 17. But if the Yellow Jackets were to win out, that would include a season-ending win over Georgia and just one loss, which could overcome the ranking clunker of a loss to N.C. State.\n \n\n   \n  The inherent problem with rankings is whether you have four teams, 12 or 16, someone always has an argument that they’ve been overlooked. Just ask the folks who’ve made the college basketball committee which is currently pondering expanding its beautiful bracket to 76 teams. Whoever is 77th will be sure to be offended.\n \n\n   \n  The CFP selection committee this year has made a big deal about its adherence to new metrics to better evaluate strength of schedule which will, according to a release issued in August, “reward teams defeating high-quality opponents while minimizing the penalty for losing to such a team.’’\n \n\n   \n  They have not, however, come out and said exactly what those metrics look at, nor have they said how they’ll be weighted versus the eye test. In reality, they can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Analytics and metrics have offered all sorts of advances in sports. Kick the point after touchdown or go for two in football? Foul a player up three points or let it play out in basketball? Better to bunt or swing away in baseball? There’s a statistical answer for all of it.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, asked specifically about the fine hairs separating the top three undefeated teams in this first ranking, Mack Rhoades, the committee chair and athletic director at Baylor, sounded like a man torn between numbers and gut feelings.\n \n\n   \n  He explained that the committee had “robust” conversations about the trio but that ultimately they split the hair based on the fact that Ohio State “when we looked at the tape, and we looked at the metrics, we felt that Ohio State was a little better up front on the offensive line and we thought they were better defensively.’’\n \n\n   \n  Because no matter what the numbers say, eventually very real humans have to make the very hard decisions. And well, going back to the poets, to err is human.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Alexander Pope also suggested the follow up - to forgive divine.\n \n\n   \n  But then again, the Englishman’s football team probably wasn’t sitting 13th in a 12-team playoff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/starbucks-china-divestment-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:19:00-11:19","title":"Starbucks Sells China Stake to Chinese Investment Firm in Strategic Shift","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks, once a dominant force in China with a rapid expansion strategy and strong brand appeal, is now selling its controlling stake in China to Chinese investment firm Boyu Capital.

Its US owner is now giving up control \n       \n  By John Liu, Simone McCarthy, and Joyce Jiang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:19 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Nearly three decades ago, Starbucks opened its first outlet in China with much fanfare, involving a troupe performing a traditional  “golden lion” dance  and eager customers trying cappuccinos made with steaming espresso machines.\n \n\n   \n  The entry of the American brand helped spur the rise of a thriving coffee culture among the burgeoning middle class of a country that traditionally drank tea, and Starbucks soon became a symbol of Western influence in a more affluent China.\n \n\n   \n  At one point the Seattle-founded coffee giant was opening a  new store every 15 hours  in China as it rode the wave of the country’s economic boom –– making the market a cornerstone of the US company’s global strategy.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s all about to change, with  Starbucks announcing on Monday  that it will sell the controlling stake of its operations in the world’s second largest economy to a Chinese investment firm.\n \n\n   \n  Under the deal, Boyu Capital will hold up to a 60% interest in Starbucks retail operations in China of over 8,000 outlets, with the coffee chain retaining a minority 40% stake and continuing to license the Starbucks brand and intellectual property to the new entity.\n \n\n   \n  For Starbucks patrons at an upscale mall in Beijing’s central business district – the same complex where the company first opened its doors in China in 1999 – the news doesn’t come as a complete surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “When Starbucks first came to China, it positioned itself as an accessible luxury, something everyone could enjoy,” said Si Huazheng, a 28-year-old in the car sales industry who was working from his laptop at the shop on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “But now, with so many domestic coffee brands popping up, the landscape has changed,” Si added.\n \n\n   \n  Starbucks is beset by a myriad of challenges in China, including fierce domestic competition and a more cost-conscious consumer base, which also includes a cohort of young people who prefer to back homegrown brands.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of beverage chains have exploded onto the scene in recent years offering coffee at steep discounts.\n \n\n   \n  At the top of that list is Luckin Coffee, a Chinese brand that has overtaken Starbucks in both sales and store count, boasting three times as many outlets in the country and coffee priced as low as one-third of Starbucks’ offerings.\n \n\n   \n  Luckin rose to prominence within just a few years after its founding in 2017, appealing to the country’s younger generation, and now it’s also challenging Starbucks on its home turf,  opening its first outlets in New York City  in June.\n \n\n   \n    Crowded market\n \n\n   \n  The beverage market in China today is nothing like the one Starbucks entered 26 years ago, when China’s economy was just beginning to take off, ﻿lifting an  estimated  hundreds of millions of Chinese into the middle class.\n \n\n   \n  Back then, there was little mainstream coffee drinking culture to speak of, and the brand was one of a handful of American food and beverage chains vying to establish themselves in country after China’s opening-up in the early 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  Starbucks’ success was forged on the back of a growing demand for Western luxuries, as well as a strategy of adapting p﻿roducts for the market –– to appeal to customers beyond China’s top-tier cities.\n \n\n   \n  Seventy-year-old retiree Liu Zishang recalls when the outlet first opened its doors in Beijing and said it took some time for the Chinese people, like him, to get used to the taste of coffee.\n \n\n   \n  “Through my spending, I get to feel the culture of Starbucks, and that’s when I started thinking, ‘Hey, this is good,’” said Liu, who was relaxing at a Starbucks in Beijing on Tuesday morning, while waiting for his grandson to finish ice skating in the same mall complex.\n \n\n   \n  But he acknowledged challenges that the outlet is facing could be linked to the country’s sluggish consumption.\n \n\n   \n  “The economic situation in China is declining, and the number of wealthy people is shrinking.” Liu said. “With the pressure of buying homes, cars, and loan payments, it’s probably weighing on their spending.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s weak consumer demand, a result of the country’s years-long property downturn and high youth unemployment rate, has made the country’s 1.4 billion people less willing to spend.\n \n\n   \n  In fiscal 2025, Starbucks  reported  a 1% decline in same store sales in China, weighed down by 5% decrease in the average amount of money a customer spends per transaction.\n \n\n   \n  Starbucks has also come under intense competition from the surging popularity of tea drinks chains like  Mixue Bingcheng , ChaGee and HeyTea.\n \n\n   \n  Mixue, which has overtaken McDonald’s and Starbucks as the world’s largest food and beverage chain by number of stores, offers its signature drinks and various coffee options for between the price of 2 to 8 yuan (30 cents to $1.20). Starbucks’ new majority owner in China, Boyu Capital, has also backed Mixue in its initial public offering earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Rivals ChaGee and HeyTea, meanwhile, target fast changing taste buds of young Chinese consumers, with unique tea and drinks offerings like Jasmine green milk tea and grape-blended tea with Cheese foam.\n \n\n   \n  The US-founded coffeeshop does still have appeal for its atmosphere and perception as a “high-end brand,” according to Ca﻿rrie Chen, 28, who works in finance and frequents Starbucks three to four times a week.\n \n\n   \n  “If you meet clients or chat with friends at Starbucks, it shows that you value the occasion,” said Chen.\n \n\n   \n  But Chen, who was sipping on a hazelnut toffee latte while taking an online course at the shop, also said Starbucks gives the impression it is “playing it safe” with its flavors and offerings in the current market.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about Starbucks’ divestment in China, Chen said the period of Starbucks’ rapid growth in the country may have already passed, but a Chinese partner could potentially “elevate Starbucks to a higher stage.”\n \n\n   \n    Broader problems\n \n\n   \n  Starbucks’ decision to divest in China is the result of a languishing Chinese business strategy, as well as intense price competition and an interest from consumers in supporting domestic brands, said Jin Lu, a public affairs expert who has worked with international brands in China for decades.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe it is yet another quick-fix and only will help the company in the near term,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The new joint venture will face “tough battles” ahead, though the partnership would be able to bolster Starbucks’ competitiveness, said Dan Su, a Morningstar analyst.\n \n\n   \n  “Menu innovation and digital transformation are necessary in the coming quarters to reassert Starbucks’ position against competing coffee, specialty tea, and other local beverage chains,” Su wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.\n \n\n   \n  Many of Starbucks’ problems in China are identical to those it faces all over the world – particularly in its home market. In North America, the Seatle-based beverage company is getting squeezed by independent coffee shops and growing rivals like Blue Bottle. Some American customers are also shunning Starbucks for its relatively high prices, compared to McDonald’s and other less expensive chains like Dunkin’.\n \n\n   \n  Together, they underscore the struggles Starbucks has faced in recent years, following a series of strategy mishaps that resulted in a leadership shake-up and the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO last year. In a bid to deliver a quick turnaround, the new top executive  initiated a plan  to close hundreds of stores, or about 1% of its locations, in the United States and Canada.\n \n\n   \n  One year after taking the helm, Niccol’s restructuring plan – including menu pare-back as well as store closures and remodeling – has shown mixed results. Last week, Starbucks  reported  a 3% annual increase in revenue and 1% decline in sales for locations open at least a year for its fiscal year 2025 ending in September.\n \n\n   \n  The joint venture announced Monday for Starbucks’ China business followed a year-long search for a local partner, with Niccol believing a strategic partner could accelerate growth in its most important foreign market.\n \n\n   \n  “We see a path to grow from today’s 8,000 Starbucks coffeehouses to more than 20,000 over time,” he said in a  company blog post  about the Boyu Capital partnership.\n \n\n   \n  Starbucks expects the total value of its China retail business to exceed $13 billion, according to the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the divestment news is stirring up some excitement on the Chinese internet, with some netizens wondering if Starbucks may join competitors Luckin Coffee and others in offering more affordable drink options.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally, I drink Luckin because Starbucks is just too expensive,” one person wrote on social media Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  “One cup of Starbucks costs me enough to buy three or four cups from Luckin.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/shein-fast-fashion-sex-dolls-france-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00.000-05:00","title":"Ultra-fast fashion and 'childlike' sex dolls: Why Shein isn’t winning friends in France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shein, a Chinese fast-fashion e-commerce giant, is facing intense backlash in France as it launches its first physical store in Paris at BHV, a historic department store.

Why Shein isn’t winning friends in France \n       \n  By Joseph Ataman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:12 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the spiritual home of fashion, the newest kid on the block is most definitely not welcome.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese-founded e-commerce giant Shein is set to open its first brick-and-mortar store in the world in Paris Wednesday, amid a storm of outrage in France over the platform’s reputation for throwaway fashion and a headline-roiling  scandal  over the sale of “childlike” sex dolls.\n \n\n   \n  From Wednesday, Shein will set up shop in BHV, one of the French capital’s most famous department stores, before rolling out its clothing range in five of France’s well-known Galeries Lafayette malls elsewhere in the country. Galeries Lafayette and BHV both belong to the Société des Grands Magasins (SGM) group.\n \n\n   \n  “The city of Paris reaffirms that Shein is contrary to its values,” Paris Deputy Mayor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj told journalists outside BHV Tuesday. “We ask the Minister of the Economy to go further than just making threats and to ban the Shein platform in France.”\n \n\n   \n  Such is the strength of feeling around Shein’s touchdown in France that Galeries Lafayette published a statement in late October slamming SGM’s decision to force Shein – a brand “in contradiction with their offer and their values” – upon them.\n \n\n   \n  In retaliation, SGM Tuesday ordered five of the Galeries Lafayette malls to rebrand as BHV, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, dealing a crippling blow to a household name brand in France.\n \n\n   \n  “Our capital cannot become the showcase for disposable goods and exploitation,” Ian Brossat, a senator for Paris from the French Communist Party, said in a  statement  Monday. “This partnership goes against all the commitments taken by France and Paris to more firmly regulate the fashion industry.”\n \n\n   \n  This week, Frédéric Merlin, head of SGM, pushed back against criticism of the deal with Shein, pointing to its popularity with consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking of a brand that is regularly bought by 25 million French customers, who are today considered bad people because they buy from this platform?” he said in an interview Tuesday with RTL radio.\n \n\n   \n  But critics believe that Paris’ reputation for haute couture, bespoke elegance and exclusive design couldn’t be further from the disposable culture epitomized by Shein’s ultra-low-price, accessible-to-all clothing.\n \n\n   \n  Some see a double irony in Shein making landfall in Paris, home to the eponymous landmark climate agreement signed in 2016, given  wide concerns  over its environmental impact.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese platform has become the bogeyman figurehead of the  fast-fashion industry , accused of paying scant regard to sustainable manufacturing and the environmental costs of mass global shipping. Shein, however, says its model allows it to avoid waste and overproduction.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Paris has sought to make itself a leader on “green” issues, championing bicycle travel and low-carbon business practices, and making sustainability a key pillar of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n \n\n   \n    Evacuate the building\n \n\n   \n  In response to Shein’s arrival, 12 brands have already announced they will remove their products from BHV’s shelves, among them prominent French clothes makers like Figaret and Armor Lux, known for their rootedness in French design and manufacturing.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest name to distance itself from BHV is Disney, with Disneyland Paris abandoning plans to design BHV’s famous Christmas window displays this year, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, BHV director Karl-Stéphane Cottendin played down the significance of the brands’ departure from a flock of “more than 2,000 brands” in BHV’s stable. “Everyone is free to make their own decisions,” he said in an interview with BFMTV. “We have no problem at all with that.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition to Shein’s arrival in Paris was clear from the earliest announcement of its partnership with BHV. But the mall’s boss has looked to exploit the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  A storeys-high poster showing SMG president and BHV owner Frederic Merlin with Shein boss Donald Tang was hung on the BHV façade in Paris last week, emblazoned with the words: “The poster that we shouldn’t have made?”\n \n\n   \n  The taunting nature of the poster was only heightened by its location, flying literally in the face of Paris’ city hall – one of the most vocal opponents to Shein’s arrival – which sits across the street from BHV.\n \n\n   \n    Hard landing\n \n\n   \n  Shein’s touchdown in Paris was almost scuppered by a scandal that rocked France over the weekend. The French finance minister threated to ban the Chinese platform from the country after revelations that “childlike sex dolls” were being sold on the e-commerce site.\n \n\n   \n  France’s High Commissioner for Children Sarah El-Haïry slammed the availability of the products on Shein’s site. “No one has the right to buy pedo-criminal dolls. These are deliberate miniature copies of children that hold teddy bears, that wear children’s clothing,” she said Monday, branding the buyers as “potential predators.”\n \n\n   \n  Also on Monday, French authorities launched investigations into Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish for allegedly disseminating “violent, pornographic, or degrading messages accessible to a minor,” as well as further investigations into Shein and AliExpress for allegedly spreading “images or depictions of minors of a pornographic nature,” according to the Paris Prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Temu, AliExpress and Wish for comment on the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN Monday, Shein’s executive chairman Tang said that, while “every seller is responsible for their own listings,” the company had banned all sales of sex dolls  and upped its internal protections. Shein will cooperate with the official investigation, the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  SGM chief Merlin told RTL radio Tuesday that he had been preparing to cancel the partnership with Shein following news of the sex doll sales. Shein’s moves to ban them saved the launch, he said.\n \n\n   \n  BHV leaders doubled down on their welcome for Shein, with Cottendin telling journalists Monday: “I believe that what is happening, which we condemn, reminds of the necessity of a store, because in a physical store these types of situations would never have taken place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/americas/mexico-protest-mayor-murder-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:46:00-05:00","title":"Murder of outspoken anti-crime mayor spurs violent protests in Mexican state","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The murder of anti-crime mayor Carlos Manzo in Uruapan, Michoacán, during a Day of the Dead celebration sparked violent protests across the state, including attacks on government buildings in Morelia and Apatzingán.

Local authorities confirmed the arrest of eight people.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, authorities in the city of Apatzingán confirmed that people had set fire to the city hall saying in a Facebook post that the violence was carried out by “shock groups whose objectives are far from the true construction of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  The shocking murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, on Saturday was one of the episodes of violence that sparked these protests in the state. There was also latent anger over the murder of Bernardo Bravo Manríquez, the head of a local citrus growers association in Apatzingán, who was found dead in October just days after calling for tighter security for agriculture workers.\n \n\n   \n  The back-to-back killings of both men, who occupied different sectors of society, showed how violence has touched every part of Michoacán life, David Mora, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The protests are “an honest reaction of the citizens of Michoacán… who for many years have been living under a context of extreme insecurity and high violence,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s murder of Manzo  adds to the wave of violence  affecting the southwestern Mexican state, where in December 2006 then-President Felipe Calderón launched what he called a “war” on organized crime. Since then, despite changes in government at the state and federal levels, violence has persisted.\n \n\n   \n  Instability has forced residents of some towns in Michoacán and neighboring Jalisco to abandon their homes completely, creating numerous “ghost towns” in the rural areas between the two states.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators referenced both Manzo and Bravo at this week’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  “For my family, for you, for Mexico, for Carlos, for Bernardo, for all who have fallen, sons of bitches!” one man shouted in a video taken by Reuters  on Monday. Other clips from protests across Michoacán, show many wearing cowboy-style hats as a nod to the late mayor’s sartorial style.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters who spoke with Reuters railed against the extortion and violence common in Michoacán, where lemon and avocado farmers are often forced to pay exorbitant bribes to drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re tired as a people,” one protester said. \n \n\n   \n     A ‘plan for peace’ \n \n\n   \n  Manzo was attacked at an event for the Day of the Dead on Saturday shortly after finishing  a livestream  on social media. The suspected attacker, who was killed at the scene but has not been identified, is a teenager believed to be between the ages of 17 and 19, Michoacan’s attorney general said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The official added that authorities believe the crime was planned by an organized crime group, but did not offer further details.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo was a popular figure in local politics in Michoacán, who was elected on a tough-on-crime platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a typical video posted on social media  in May , Manzo addressed local police while wearing a bullet-proof vest and his signature cowboy hat, warning them against providing criminals with “leniency.”\n \n\n   \n  “Any criminal you encounter who is armed and resists arrest or attacks citizens, if you detect them during operations, you must take them down; there should be no leniency with them,” Manzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The late mayor was also a fierce critic of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party’s approach to the country’s security issues. Manzo often posted announcements of new arrests on his  Facebook page , along with pleas to Sheinbaum’s government for better security in the face of crime and extortion in his city.\n \n\n   \n  One recent post, which Manzo implored his followers to share widely, demanded that Sheinbaum “not leave Uruapan alone in the fight against federal crimes, which are the responsibility of the federation to address.” CNN reached out to Sheinbaum’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sheinbaum spent most of her morning press conference addressing Manzo’s death and her government’s “plan for peace and justice” in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment is to get to the truth and do justice in the case of the cowardly murder of Carlos Manzo,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum said her plan would take aim at the roots of crime through strategic investments in education, living wages for farm workers, and strengthening rural infrastructure. The plan also includes “strengthening the presence of federal forces in Michoacán,” according to a document released by the president’s office after the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  Mora does not see much new in Sheinbaum’s proposal, particularly around more federal troops in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doubling down on things that we’ve seen are not necessarily working in other states, in other parts of Mexico,” Mora said. “She’s sending more troops in, and that’s basically what they have been doing in Sinaloa for the past year.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the presence of troops in Sinaloa, home to Mexico’s  oldest and most  violent criminal organizations, has not reduced the crime and murder rate.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at the homicide numbers and other crimes,” Mora continued, “there’s not a direct connection between the presence of federal forces in the state and the lower numbers of murders and other crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Mora pointed out that violence is not new in Michoacán, either. Between January and September of this year, official data shows 1,024 intentional homicides in Michoacán, placing it as  the seventh highest Mexican state for homicides in 2025 .\n \n\n   \n  The figures are lower than those of 2024, although there are no details on how many are directly linked to organized crime. Civil society organizations believe the true figure to be much higher.\n \n\n   \n  “But this reaction,” Mora said, referring to the protests, “Organic and honest, fed up with the security situation in the state – is something new.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/ghazala-hashmi-virginia-lt-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"Ghazala Hashmi to win Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, CNN projects, becoming first Muslim woman elected statewide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ghazala Hashmi, a Democratic state senator from Richmond, has been projected to win the Virginia lieutenant governor's race, becoming the nation’s first Muslim woman elected to a statewide office and Virginia’s first Indian American in such a role.

10:02 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pennsylvania Democrats defended the  liberal majority on the state Supreme Court  Tuesday, CNN’s Decision Desk projects, blocking GOP efforts to flip the balance of power ahead of the next presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  Justices Kevin Dougherty, Christine Donohue and David Wecht were retained for new 10-year terms. They faced no opponents, only a yes-or-no vote on whether to extend their tenures on the state Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  If even two of the justices had been voted out, liberals could have lost their 5-2 majority on the state’s high court, giving Republicans a chance to flip the ideological balance in replacement elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That could have had significant implications for the court’s approach to potential election litigation around the 2028 presidential election after it played a key role in both 2020 and 2024, as well as the next round of congressional redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Both parties mounted aggressive campaigns around the retention vote, directing millions of dollars to the state while flooding voters’ screens and mailboxes.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 contender himself,  cut an ad  in support of the three Democratic justices, while the state’s wealthiest individual, conservative megadonor Jeff Yass, organized an extensive field and advertising campaign through his organizational network.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats put a heavy emphasis on abortion rights in their advertising, warning of  bans in other states  and casting the court’s liberal majority as “ our last line of defense .” Republican opponents, meanwhile, regularly slammed the “ partisan justices ” that they argued “ have not protected our rights .”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s vote also served as an early test for the rebuilding state Democratic Party under new chairman Eugene DePasquale, who has been working to reset his party’s fortunes after a disappointing 2024 election cycle, with a 2026 gubernatorial race and the next White House campaign around the corner.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the vote, DePasquale had described it as “the most pivotal judicial retention in our state’s history.”\n \n\n   \n  Justices Dougherty, Donohue and Wecht were first elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2015. Along with Chief Justice Debra Todd, first elected in 2007, and Justice Daniel McCaffery, elected in 2023, they form a five-member liberal majority on the seven-member court. Justices Kevin Brobson, elected in 2021, and Justice Sallie Mundy, elected in 2017, form the two-member conservative minority.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania is one of the most important battleground states in the country. It has alternated between the parties at the presidential level over the last four elections and drew more campaign ad money than any other state in the 2024 cycle — over $1 billion, according to data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/colombia-us-trump-payments-rubio","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"US is yet to follow through on Trump promise to halt ‘all payments’ to Colombia as Rubio stresses importance of relationship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump’s public declaration to halt all US payments to Colombia, no such cuts have been implemented as of November 4, 2025.

‘all payments’ to Colombia as Rubio stresses importance of relationship \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More than two weeks after President Donald Trump said he would   halt “all payments”  to Colombia, there has not been any interruption to the assistance, even after the administration sanctioned the country’s President Gustavo Petro accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no comprehensive ongoing interagency review of all the US assistance programs to Colombia being carried out, US officials said. They pointed to a strong country-to-country relationship, built on decades of investment and singled out Petro as the biggest impediment to shoring up the joint efforts to tackle illicit drug production and trafficking inside the country. Though a review is ongoing at the State Department, a senior department official said.\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s social media post deeming Petro a drug trafficker and calling for a cutting of all payments and subsidies to the country, there was an interagency meeting planned with all of the Cabinet heads to discuss US support to Columbia, US officials said. But that meeting was canceled for unknown reasons and has not been rescheduled.\n \n\n   \n  The axing of the inter-agency meeting meant that Trump’s national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been instrumental to the administration’s overall policy approach to the region – was again left as the most influential voice in the president’s ear in shaping the policy. Rubio’s staff began working with the Treasury Department to quickly put sanctions on Petro into place, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio, following Trump’s initial Truth Social post, publicly cited the “excellent” US-Colombia relationship, founded on strong partnership.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the status of the policy, a senior administration official highlighted to the country’s difficulty tackling drug trafficking under Petro’s leadership, and pointed to a review of US assistance at the presidential level.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite billions of US taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia’s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under President Petro’s failed policies. President Trump is carefully reviewing every program and only investing in projects that show clear value to protecting US citizens,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has both imposed sanctions on Petro and decertified Colombia as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking, citing the Colombian president’s “disastrous and ineffective counternarcotics policies,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement announcing the decertification in late October.\n \n\n   \n  As part of that decertification, Rubio approved a “significant cut to security assistance in Colombia,” a senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “That reduction is now being implemented, and there is an active and comprehensive review of FY25 funds that is underway,” they said, without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration’s issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “The politics of Colombia are not actually reflected by the current president,” the top US diplomat said as he prepared to head to Asia with Trump. “Our problem with the current president, in addition to his behavior, which has been erratic and counterproductive, is that in fact he is not cooperating on our counter-drug, and we felt that was best addressed at the individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubio’s remarks came as a relief to US officials who had been privately hoping that the administration would climb down and draw a distinction between penalizing the country and targeting the actions and bellicose rhetoric of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio went on to say that the targeting of Petro – whom he called a “hostile foreign leader” – is “separate” from any effort to punish the joint efforts at the working level between the two countries, which the US has invested in for decades.\n \n\n   \n  While the administration has pointed to both Colombia and Venezuela as driving the drug trade, their approach to tackling the problem in each country greatly differs because of contrasting diplomatic histories. Tough sanctions have been imposed on Venezuela by both Republican and Democratic administrations given a rupture in diplomatic relations after the country’s National Assembly declared Nicolás Maduro was not the country’s legitimate leader in 2019, which was a position the US backed.\n \n\n   \n  And, in 2024, the  US accused Maduro  of stealing the country’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US-Colombia relations remain intact despite tensions at the top. Trump administration officials have also drawn up plans for  strikes inside Venezuela , while there are no plans for the same kind of action inside Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials are keenly aware of the political calendar in South America’s largest country: Petro’s presidency will end next year as he is constitutionally barred from running for a second term in the 2026 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they’re going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s anger towards Petro comes after the Colombian leader has taken on the US president very personally in addition to harshly criticizing the administration’s drug war and its support for Israel.  US officials were stunned and angry when Petro joined pro-Palestinian protests in New York in September and called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump.” It prompted the US  to revoke Petro’s visa .\n \n\n   \n  But days later, back in Colombia, the left-wing leader doubled down.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Trump keeps being complicit in the genocide, as he is up to today, he deserves nothing but jail, and his army should not obey him,” Petro said in Bogota.\n \n\n   \n  Petro’s hostile stance towards Trump continued as the US drug boat strikes in the Caribbean have continued  at a steady pace  for the last two months. After one strike he accused the US of murdering a Colombian fisherman, fueling tensions and ultimately triggering Trump to declare that the US would halt payments to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that at least one US military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months  targeted Colombian nationals on a boat  that had left from Colombia, according to two people briefed by the Pentagon about the strikes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘failures and incompetence’ of Petro\n \n\n   \n  When the US rolled out sanctions against Petro and two of his family members in recent weeks, Rubio also officially decertified Colombia as a partner in combatting drug trafficking. But the State Department’s language announcing the decertification made clear that US support for the country’s institutions are expected to endure.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support for Colombian security forces, its justice sector, and departmental and municipal officials, and we will continue to partner with them in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking,” the State Department announcement said. “Today’s decision is not a reflection on these institutions but rather the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior administration official pointed to the sanctioning of Petro and his family as a Trump decision after the Colombian president failed to strengthen efforts to tackle the drug problem.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision to impose sanctions on Petro and his family was ultimately made at the Presidential level, as is every action. President Trump made it clear that Colombia is ‘failing demonstrably’ to uphold its drug control responsibilities, and Petro has since doubled down in defense of his failed policies,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Some US foreign assistance to the country had already stopped after the destruction of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) early in Trump’s second term. However, the US has continued to provide funding from the State and Defense departments, including on counternarcotics. The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to  data  from the US Department of State.\n \n\n   \n  While US officials believe that the strategy to target Petro instead of the whole of Colombia’s security institutions is settled for the time being, they warn that things could always quickly change.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking a day after Rubio last month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump believes that both Venezuela and Colombia “have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long.” Graham added, during his CBS interview, that Trump said there were plans to brief members of Congress after his trip to Asia “about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.”\n \n\n   \n    Unintended consequences\n \n\n   \n  The US has been working to establish the close relationship it has with Colombia since the late 1990s. The Clinton administration launched Plan Colombia in 2000, which was a $1.3 billion program primarily to support the military and security forces’ fight against growing and trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  But before that period in 1997 the US had cut off assistance to Colombia and decertified it as partner in combatting drug trafficking. Many reflected that the action did not produce the intended results.\n \n\n   \n  “US officials concluded that we actually did more damage to ourselves by cutting off assistance to Colombia than actually punish Ernesto Samper,” said Juan Gonzalez, a former NSC official focused on the Western Hemisphere during the Biden administration who is currently a fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute.\n \n\n   \n  The US support to the Colombian police was robust before that cutoff: helping pay for judicialized wiretaps, training police and vetting them. Gonzalez said that the cutoff in assistance during that period of time limited the US Department of Justice’s ability build cases against the cartels inside of Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that today’s continued funding to Colombia’s security and defense forces – which includes ongoing intelligence sharing between the two nations – is critical to achieve the administration’s own goals for fighting drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Colombia, said the US support on defense is “really, really significant.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re talking about two militaries that are deeply integrated and cooperating, and they work more closely together, I think, than any other country that the US works with that’s not in NATO,” she told CNN. “We’re talking about sort of an institutional relationship, sharing of intelligence, sharing of capabilities, day to day collaboration on logistics, operations.”\n \n\n   \n  “If that were to go by the wayside,” Dickinson said, “the capability of the Colombian security forces would be debilitated significantly” at a time when the country is facing major security challenges.\n \n\n   \n  And if intelligence sharing were to be cut, it would leave the US “flying blind,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “85% of all actionable intelligence that the US uses to interdict drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia,” Dickinson said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not sharing humint (human intelligence), electronic intel on shipments, routes, organizations, schedules, methods – you’re cutting off what’s needed to do the stated thing you want to do – stop the flow,” a former US diplomat who worked on the issue told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former US diplomat who worked on the issue said cutting the security funding would be “cutting one’s nose to spite one’s face.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/asia/typhoon-kalmaegi-deaths-philippines-cebu-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00-05:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi kills at least 58 in the Philippines, heads toward Vietnam","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, killed at least 58 people in the Philippines, including six military personnel from a helicopter crash in Agusan del Sur, and caused widespread flooding, power outages, and evacuations across the Visayas and Mindanao regions.

least 58 people were dead after Typhoon Kalmaegi left a trail of destruction in the central Philippines and continued to batter parts of Palawan island on Wednesday as it headed toward the South China Sea.\n \n\n   \n  Among the fatalities were six military personnel whose  helicopter crashed  in Agusan del Sur on the island of Mindanao during a humanitarian mission.\n \n\n   \n  Scenes of devastation emerged in the province of Cebu, a major tourist hub, as floodwaters receded, revealing destroyed homes, overturned vehicles, and widespread debris. The disaster agency reported 13 people missing.\n \n\n   \n  The devastation from Kalmaegi, locally named Tino, comes just over a month after a magnitude  6.9 earthquake  struck northern Cebu, killing dozens and displacing thousands.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi, which has weakened after making landfall early Tuesday, is forecast to regain strength while over the South China Sea, state weather PAGASA said in its latest bulletin.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200,000 people were evacuated across the Visayas region, including parts of southern Luzon and northern Mindanao, ahead of a storm that submerged homes and caused widespread flooding and power outages.\n \n\n   \n  Packing winds of 120 kph and gusts of up to 165 kph, Kalmaegi, the 20th storm to hit the Philippines this year, is heading toward Vietnam where preparations are underway ahead of its expected landfall on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  In September,  Super Typhoon Ragasa  swept across northern Luzon, forcing schools and government offices to shut down as it brought fierce winds and torrential rain.\n \n\n   \n  Floods in Cebu City had subsided late on Tuesday but power was still out in many places and telecommunications services were intermittent, a Reuters journalist in Cebu said.\n \n\n   \n  Photos and videos from the Philippine Red Cross showed rescue workers wading through knee-deep floodwaters in Cebu City, using boats to reach stranded residents. In Liloan town, on the northern outskirts of the city, homes were submerged, with only rooftops and top floors visible.\n \n\n   \n  Similar scenes from other parts of Cebu City, with vehicles and streets under water, circulated on social media.\n \n\n   \n  State weather agency PAGASA said the combination of Kalmaegi and a shear line had brought heavy rains and strong winds across the Visayas and nearby areas.\n \n\n   \n  More than 180 flights to and from the affected areas were canceled on Tuesday, while those at sea were advised to head to the nearest safe harbor immediately and to stay in port.\n \n\n   \n  PAGASA had earlier warned of a high risk of “life-threatening and damaging storm surges” that could reach more than 3 meters (9.84 ft) high along coastal and low-lying communities in the central Philippines, including parts of Mindanao.\n \n\n   \n  The Vietnamese government also said on Tuesday that it was preparing for the worst-case scenario as it braced for the impact of Kalmaegi.\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon is forecast to make landfall on Thursday night in Vietnam’s central regions, which have already suffered heavy floods that killed at least 40 people and left six others missing over the past week.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a very strong typhoon, which continues to strengthen after entering the East Sea,” the government said in a statement, referring to the South China Sea.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi comes as the Philippines, which is hit by an average of 20 tropical storms each year, recovers from a run of disasters including earthquakes and severe weather events in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Super Typhoon Ragasa swept across northern Luzon, forcing government work and classes to shut down as it brought fierce winds and torrential rain.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger-wins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-05:00","title":"Democrat Abigail Spanberger is elected Virginia’s first female governor, CNN’s Decision Desk projects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger, a former U.S. congresswoman and CIA officer, has been projected to win Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial election, becoming the state’s first female governor.

Winsome Earle-Sears  after running a campaign focused on affordability and addressing  local concerns about the impact of federal job cuts and the government shutdown  on a state with more than 300,000 US government employees. Spanberger also frequently tied Earle-Sears to President Donald Trump, labeling the Republican as a Trump acolyte  even though the president didn’t endorse her .\n \n\n   \n  Her victory will flip control from Republican Gov.

She was first elected to Virginia’s 7th Congressional District after  beating former Rep. Dave Brat , who shocked onetime House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary, and served three terms before leaving the House this year.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger came out to huge cheers from her supporters at her election night event Tuesday night after CNN projected the Democrat would win Virginia’s governor race.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” she said. “We sent a message to every corner of the commonwealth, a message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country.

Her law enforcement background led her to receive the coveted endorsement of Virginia’s Police Benevolent Association, even though the same group endorsed the Republican ticket four years ago. The Virginia PBA this year endorsed Republicans for lieutenant governor and attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  She remained a  disciplined messenger , focusing on economic issues while hitting Earle-Sears on social issues such as abortion access and same-sex marriage. Her ads aimed to portray Earle-Sears as a strident, inflexible conservative and often used versions of the same clip of Earle-Sears telling an unruly crowd, “I am speaking!”\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears tried to recreate  Youngkin’s winning playbook  from four years ago against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, emphasizing deregulatory initiatives that would expand Virginia’s workforce. But she faced doubts from members of her own party throughout the contest about her campaign strategy and was running in a year when a Republican leads the White House. Historically, the party that doesn’t control Washington most often prevails in Virginia’s gubernatorial election.\n \n\n   \n  An immigrant from Jamaica who served in the Marines, Earle-Sears holds socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage.

cave on shutdown \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Some of the most prominent liberals in Congress are seething at an emerging deal to end the 35-day government funding stalemate without a clear win for Democrats, showcasing a massive splinter within the party that will soon be on full display.\n \n\n   \n  The divide among Democrats inside the Capitol over strategy offers a gloomy portrait of how a possible deal could land in the broader party — likely spurring ugly infighting at a critical moment as Democrats are seeking to define their future ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  There is still no official agreement within a group of Senate centrists that have been privately meeting to discuss a shutdown exit ramp. But multiple sources involved in discussions told CNN that a deal could be reached as soon as this week to pass a temporary stopgap bill to reopen the government alongside several full-year spending bills — with a promise of a future vote to extend billions in enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly a dozen Senate Democrats have privately signaled that they are willing to support a stopgap funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on health care, two Democratic sources familiar with the discussions told CNN Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations are still ongoing on exactly what kind of stopgap funding bill the Senate would take up and how it would pass the House, the sources familiar said, but that level of party support in the Senate would be more than enough for Congress to end the funding standoff that has ground Washington to a halt for more than a month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a reflection of the mounting frustration of many Democratic senators who can’t stomach any more shutdown pain, after this week’s partial cut-off in food aid, with the shutdown set to break the 35-day record on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Still, it won’t appease the scores of liberal senators now warning that the party will lose its leverage, and alienate voters, if it accepts such an offer.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Democrats cave on this, I think it would be a betrayal to millions and millions of working families who want them to stand up and protect their health care benefits,” a furious Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent told reporters on Tuesday when asked what message the centrist-led talks would send to voters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re suckers to believe that a party that is opposed to extending the subsidies now is all of a sudden going to be supportive of that a month from now,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut put it plainly, referring to the billions of dollars in enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire next month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear whether these liberal Democrats will attempt to pressure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to scuttle the dealmaking by the centrists or whether he would have any interest in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats huddled for nearly three hours Tuesday on the path forward, but remained uncharacteristically tight-lipped as they left. Schumer was also mum on whether he endorses the emerging plan, telling reporters: “We discussed all of the options.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaving Tuesday’s marathon meeting, retiring Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan called it “really one of the most productive caucus meetings I’ve been in.” He stressed there were no “whip counts” and instead, “everybody had a chance to really talk about ideas and issues.”\n \n\n   \n  And among the centrist Democrats, few are willing to speak publicly about where talks stand with Republicans – but many acknowledged the progress made in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the lunch on Tuesday, senators were briefed on the state of the negotiations and about the “opportunities to work together,” according to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said after the lunch meeting that the pace “has definitely picked up” but declined to get into specifics of the talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think when there’s a deal and I get something on health care, I’ll be ready to vote,” Slotkin said, but wouldn’t say whether an ACA subsidies vote is sufficient.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters that Democrats were still talking to Republicans and acknowledged the massive gulf between the two parties on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously we’re in different universes on how we’re trying to address this issue of rising costs for people,” Kelly said when asked whether a future vote on ACA subsidies could end the stalemate. “We want to bring down their health care costs, or at least make sure it’s what it was last year. My Republican colleagues and the White House seem not to care about that.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “But, you know, this thing can’t go on forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine similarly signaled willingness to engage with Republicans on future health care talks — as long as the bill included protections for thousands of federal workers in his own district.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to have a path to fixing the ACA, but all the I’s and T’s don’t have to be dotted and crossed,” Kaine said, stressing that his priority in a funding deal was blocking President Donald Trump from freely firing workers and canceling federal projects, rather than a guaranteed extension of the Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Stop the mischief, no more firings, no more furloughs, no more cancellation of projects,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she wanted to establish a working group to lay out a framework to address the rising cost of health care but didn’t want to state what she would or wouldn’t accept in order to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate in the press,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some Democrats were adamant they would not relent without a clear agreement from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “A promise ain’t good enough for me,” Sen Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/snap-benefits-trump-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:40:00Z","title":"White House says it will partially fund SNAP benefits after Trump threatens to withhold them until shutdown ends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2025 government shutdown, the White House agreed to partially fund SNAP (food stamp) benefits despite President Donald Trump’s public threat to withhold them until the shutdown ended.

partially fund critical food aid during the government shutdown, despite President Donald Trump’s threat just hours earlier that he would withhold the federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken with Trump and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can,” Leavitt said of the program, which is more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump sparked widespread confusion earlier Tuesday when he appeared to abruptly reverse course on the  administration’s funding plan,  writing on Truth Social that SNAP “will be given only when those Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!”\n \n\n   \n  That move would have left millions of people without the monthly federal assistance they rely on to purchase food and sparked a fresh legal showdown. More than two dozen states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses sued in separate cases last week to force the administration to keep at least some of the aid flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye Perryman, the CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization involved in the coalition’s lawsuit that also sought continuation of the SNAP benefits,  wrote on X  in response to Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The administration is tapping into a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to support partial benefits into November. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, issued guidance earlier Tuesday to states for distributing the partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans  receive SNAP benefits , which amount to roughly $350 per household per month on average when paid out in full.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA last month said it could not pay November’s benefits, citing concerns over whether it could legally use the contingency fund or move money from other accounts. But the courts ruled that the government must tap into the contingency fund to pay partial benefits and could shift other money to enable it to fully pay the more than $8 billion in benefits, as well as other costs. And Trump himself previously indicated he had instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it could legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” he wrote Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The administration ultimately opted to use the contingency fund to pay out partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n    Varying benefit amounts\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone will receive half their benefit amount this month, according to the USDA guidance issued to states on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Those who receive the maximum monthly allotment – which in most of the country is $994 for a family of four – will receive half that amount. And one and two person households who receive the minimum monthly benefit will get $12, instead of the usual $24.\n \n\n   \n  But those in between will likely see less than half of their usual allotment, with the amount depending on their household size and income, according to Stacy Dean, who ran the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  States will have to recalculate these recipients’ benefit amount based on the reduced maximum allotment tables that USDA issued in its guidance, which is a faster way to get the payments out the door than to cut all recipients’ assistance in half. (States already base SNAP benefits on the agency’s maximum allotment tables.)\n \n\n   \n    Push to provide full benefits\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Rhode Island, meanwhile, scheduled a Thursday hearing to consider a fresh request for an order requiring the Trump administration to provide full food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell will be the latest episode in a dramatic showdown over the benefits that is playing out in two federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  After the government notified McConnell of its plans on Monday that it would provide only partial SNAP benefits, the coalition that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing USDA’s choice did not comport with the requirements of his order last week.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs are asking the judge to issue a new order that would tap into unused tariff funds meant for child nutrition programs to provide SNAP benefits for November. As part of that bid, they seized on Trump’s social media post in their lawsuit challenging the decision not to fully fund SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to threatening defiance of the Court’s order, the post makes plain what Plaintiffs explained in their motion to enforce: Defendants are withholding SNAP benefits from individuals and families who need vital food assistance for partisan political gain,” attorneys for the coalition wrote in court papers.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA told the court Monday that it would not utilize the tariff revenue because it would endanger the nation’s free and reduced-price school meals program, which serves about 29 million children a day. (The agency has transferred $750 million in tariff revenue to the WIC food assistance program for pregnant women, new moms and young children.)\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s hearing is set for 3:30 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/nyc-mayor-zohran-mamdani-wins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:36:00-05:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani will win New York City mayoral election, CNN’s Decision Desk projects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist and three-term state assemblyman, has been projected to win the New York City mayoral election, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:36 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist whose focus on working-class issues and personal magnetism attracted a diverse coalition of volunteers and supporters to propel a once-underdog campaign, will win New York City’s general election race for mayor, CNN’s Decision Desk projects.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani beat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for a second time, shattering the political scion’s hopes of a comeback after his loss to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Also running in the general election was Republican Curtis Sliwa, who refused to end his campaign despite pressure from Cuomo and his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win marks a victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party at a time when national Democrats are divided over how to counter President Donald Trump. The president is himself a native New Yorker who has falsely derided Mamdani as a “communist” and suggested he’d “take over” the city if he is elected.\n \n\n   \n  The results are likely to echo far beyond New York City, elevating both Mamdani’s profile and platform, including his proposals to freeze the rent for New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments, make public buses free to ride and provide universal childcare by taxing the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win completes a meteoric rise a year after the state assemblyman launched his bid for mayor, promising to make the most expensive city in the country affordable for its working class.\n \n\n   \n    Who is Zohran Mamdani?\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who entered the mayor’s race as one of several apparent also-rans to what appeared to be Cuomo’s race to lose.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Uganda and first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Mamdani moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming an assemblyman, Mamdani was a housing counselor and self-described C-list rapper who went by the name “Mr. Cardamom.” His short-lived music career was sometimes front and center in his opponent’s attack ads.\n \n\n   \n  The music video for “Nani,” a rap song where Mamdani pays homage to his grandma and New York City’s South Asian culture, also shows him shirtless, donning only an apron, looking directly at the camera while he rocks side to side. The image was plastered across anti-Mamdani campaign ads to poke fun at his past music career and his lack of governmental experience.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Epstein, a campaign aide, noted that Mamdani’s rapping career helped him indirectly in his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “An incredible asset for anybody seeking to run for office is bravery in the face of embarrassment and being able to push through the natural inclination many of us have not to kind of introduce themselves to strangers or do things in a kind of silly way in front of them,” Epstein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani made a steady climb in the mayor’s race by producing a constant stream of social media videos, including interviews with voters who had supported Trump in 2024 due to the high cost of living. He ran a groundbreaking digital campaign in which he spoke in multiple languages and connected with supporters with a message anchored to affordability.  During the campaign, Mamdani, who natively speaks Urdu, released campaign videos in Bangla, Spanish, and Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  One of his most memorable viral videos tackled what the candidate referred to as “halal-flation.” He set out to interview street meat vendors about the high cost of running a street food business in New York City. With a mouthful of rice and halal meat, Mamdani detailed how an arcane permit system in the city is in part to blame for the prices of what should be cheap street food.\n \n\n   \n  “This was one of the coldest nights of the year, bitterly cold,” Epstein recalled recently. “We were downtown by Zuccotti Park near Wall Street and Zohran just asking people on the street, ‘Would you rather pay $10 or $8 for halal?’ People were pushing through trying to get home, you know, it was rejection over and over and over and over again, but it never fazed him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was cutting into Cuomo’s lead in public polling by the June primary. The city’s traditional power brokers, including the real estate and business sectors concerned with Mamdani’s democratic socialist identity, banded together in support of Cuomo and donated millions of dollars to anti-Mamdani super PACs. Business leaders argued Mamdani would drive wealthy New Yorkers out and discourage businesses from operating in the nation’s financial capital.\n \n\n   \n  Their push ultimately helped Mamdani cast his campaign as a fight between working-class people and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  Still, his primary victory shocked much of the political world.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think the line is so much between progressives and moderates. It’s between fighters and fakers,” said city comptroller Brad Lander, who ran against Mamdani but allied with him under the primary’s ranked-choice voting system. “What Zohran is showing is that it’s worth putting up big bold ideas for change, standing up and fighting for them, and that’s pretty hopeful. Yes, he’s a democratic socialist, but he had a bold vision for the future of the city and that excited people.”\n \n\n   \n    The general election campaign\n \n\n   \n  After taking a vacation in Uganda to celebrate his wedding, Mamdani returned to a city mourning the deaths of New York police officer Didarul Islam and three others in a Midtown Manhattan shooting. He was confronted with his years of tweets criticizing the police, including references to law enforcement as racist and wicked and calling for them to be defunded.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he would tell reporters after meeting with Islam’s family, part of an overall shift away from anti-police rhetoric that culminated in recent weeks with his commitment to retain the current police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  He also reached out to New York’s Jewish community, roiled by his criticisms of Israel’s government and questions about democratic socialism. Mamdani is an outspoken advocate for  Palestinian rights, a supporter of the movement to boycott and divest from Israel and a fierce critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel and was in line to cast an early vote. She declined to say who she chose.\n \n\n   \n    The last days of the campaign\n \n\n   \n  In the closing days of the campaign, Mamdani referred to the race as a choice between “oligarchy and democracy.”  His omnipresence on the campaign trail was on display during the last days of the race and in the lead-up to the last weekend of early voting in the city.\n \n\n   \n  As more than half a million New Yorkers turned out to cast their votes early, Mamdani was everywhere: He was in church in the morning, calling into radio shows midday, stopping into ethnic supermarkets in the outer boroughs, popping up on influencer live streams, joining a Union Square freestyle rap battle and capping off his Saturday with a whirlwind tour of the city’s nightclub scene.\n \n\n   \n  Paying homage to the city that never sleeps, Mamdani appeared to hardly do so either, stopping at six nightclubs in Brooklyn just to do it all over again on the last Sunday of early voting. He attended a church service with his parents, met campaign volunteers before stopping on the sidelines of the New York City Marathon, went to Queens for a meet-up with Gov. Kathy Hochul to cheer on the Buffalo Bills, and popped up in the nosebleeds of Madison Square Garden for a New York Knicks game.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo also campaigned across the city. Notably, he tried to cut into Mamdani’s core support of South Asian and Muslim voters by highlighting Mamdani’s opposition to criminal penalties for prostitution. He also laughed when a radio host suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11 attack, drawing allegations from Mamdani and others that he was playing to Islamophobia. Cuomo denied he was doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams ended his independent bid and endorsed Cuomo. But Cuomo was unable to push Sliwa, the Republican nominee, out of the race, denying anti-Mamdani voters the chance to consolidate behind one opponent. Sliwa repeatedly and colorfully vowed he would die before making way for Cuomo, arguing he owed it to his supporters to keep running.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, Tuesday’s results are likely a coda to a long and eventful political career. He was governor of New York for nearly 11 years before resigning in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment, allegations he has denied, and amid criticism of how his administration handled Covid-19 cases in nursing homes. Running for mayor, Cuomo leaned into his executive experience, often pointing out Mamdani’s short career in politics and relative lack of work history.\n \n\n   \n  He relaunched his mayoral bid as an independent after losing to Mamdani in June. He remained focused on public safety, promising to hire additional police officers and build more housing. Cuomo, who has a longstanding relationship with Trump, also sought to portray himself as the better candidate to fend off the president’s attacks on New York City.\n \n\n   \n    A history-making mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will be inaugurated on January 1, 2026. He inherits a deeply complex city home to 8.5 million people, a large bureaucracy, a municipal workforce of roughly 300,000 and a city budget of $115 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will make history as New York City’s first Muslim mayor, the first South Asian to hold the office and one of the youngest mayors elected in modern times. He recently married Rama Duwaji, an artist of Syrian descent who was born in Texas and moved to New York City to complete a master’s degree in illustration. Duwaji skipped traditional campaigning alongside her husband on the trail and while it remains unclear whether she will have any role in his administration, at 28, she will be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani’s identity as both an immigrant and a South Asian New Yorker was central to his campaign, his connection to that community began to take shape long before he launched his run for City Hall. He first made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has a strong connection to the cab driver community in New York City, which is largely made up of immigrants, including thousands of South Asians who were among his fiercest supporters. In the last days of the campaign, Mamdani made a stop at LaGuardia Airport’s taxi stand at midnight, catching cabbies at shift change.\n \n\n   \n  “Without the night shift, there is no morning,” Mamdani told them.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:13:00.000Z","title":"Foreign climbers and Nepali guides among 7 killed in avalanche on Nepal mountain","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal killed at least seven people, including five foreign climbers and two Nepali guides.

Mahato previously said five Nepali guides and porters were able to make their own way back to base camp, located at 4,900 meters (16,070 feet).\n \n\n   \n  Authorities had said three people had died on the mountain before updating the figure on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Weather has been deteriorating since last week in Nepal, with snowstorms reported on the mountains, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams launched an hours-long operation to reach the climbers but the weather conditions, high altitude and difficult terrain complicated their efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a problem of oxygen also,” Mahato told CNN. “Only trained people who live in hilly, mountain area can conduct rescue operations. That’s why we are coordinating with local climbers and guides. The weather is a challenge too, it’s constantly changing.”\n \n\n   \n  The weather cleared enough for a helicopter to land with a search and rescue team on Tuesday,  AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  Among those injured was French climber Isabelle Solange Thaon, 54, who told AP from her hospital bed in the capital Kathmandu that she lost her husband, Christian Manfred, in the avalanche.\n \n\n   \n  “We were lucky because we were on the left,” Thaon said, adding that they lept over the rocks and swam in the snow until help arrived to pull them out, according to the news agency.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Christian died… because rocks hit his head,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 tallest mountains, including Mount Everest.\n \n\n   \n  Mountaineering expedition companies describe Mount Yalung Ri, located in eastern Nepal’s Rolwaling Valley, as a peak suitable for beginners with no previous experience or for those acclimatizing for higher summits of the Himalayas, which can tower above 8,000 meters.\n \n\n   \n  Spring is the most popular climbing season, when weather is more favorable on those tall peaks. However, hundreds of foreign climbers come to climb smaller peaks during the autumn months between the rainy monsoon months and winter, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n  Mahato said that while the avalanche occurred “suddenly,” authorities had warned climbers in the region about the rain and imminent monsoon.\n \n\n   \n  “But they had started their climb before the monsoon occurred,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate incident, the bodies of two Italian climbers were recovered on Tuesday during search and rescue operations on the 6,887-meter (22,595-foot) Mount Panbari, in Nepal’s western Manaslu region.\n \n\n   \n  Three Italian climbers had been reported missing on the mountain after they lost contact on October 29 following heavy snowfall, the district’s deputy superintendent of police, Gorkha Raj Kumar Shrestha, told CNN. One of the climbers had been rescued at base camp on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies of the other two, identified as Stefano Farronato, 51, and Alessandro Caputo, 28, were found buried in the snow at camp one on Tuesday, Shrestha said.\n \n\n   \n  Man-made climate change has made weather patterns less predictable, including in the Himalayas.\n \n\n   \n  Last month  hundreds of trekkers had to be rescued  from the northern Chinese side of Everest after unusually heavy snow and rainfall pummelled the Himalayas.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/nj-governor-mikie-sherrill-wins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:25:00-04:00","title":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill will win New Jersey governor’s race, CNN projects","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill wins the New Jersey governor’s race, becoming the first female Democratic governor in the state’s history and maintaining Democratic control after a year of political shifts tied to President Donald Trump’s first term.

\n   \n  Democratic Rep.  Mikie Sherrill  will win the race for governor in New Jersey, CNN’s Decision Desk projects, maintaining Democratic control of the seat one year after the state showed signs of shifting toward President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, who will be the first female Democratic governor in the state’s history, defeated Republican nominee  Jack Ciattarelli , a former state assemblyman and Trump ally making his third run for governor. She is set to follow the term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, marking the first time a party has held the governor’s office in New Jersey for more than two full consecutive terms in the last 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory likely will be viewed as a repudiation of Trump’s first year in office and demonstrates the Democratic Party’s staying power in New Jersey even as it rebuilds on the national level.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill put opposition to Trump and his agenda at the center of her campaign messaging, often linking Ciattarelli to the Republican president. She hewed to moderate policies and prioritized cost-of-living concerns, including rolling out plans to address  skyrocketing utility costs  in the state.\n \n\n   \n  Her win comes a year after Trump made significant gains in the state in the 2024 election. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 points to former Vice President Kamala Harris but reduced his margin of defeat by 10 points compared with 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, a 53-year-old attorney and mother of four, was first elected to Congress in 2018 as part of a blue wave in Trump’s first term in office. A former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill featured her military experience in her campaign advertisements, saying in one TV spot, “I know the world feels like it is on fire right now, but I was trained in the Navy that in a crisis, you run to the fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli, meanwhile, sought to tie Sherrill to the outgoing Democratic administration in Trenton, which he blamed for high energy costs, and to progressive Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. Ciattarelli, a former critic of Trump, embraced the president throughout much of his campaign,  saying in one debate  that Trump’s second-term performance deserved an “A” grade.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill held a slight edge in public polling over Ciattarelli for most of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch, the candidates traded increasingly personal and heated attacks.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli  amplified a story  about Sherrill not walking at her graduation from the Naval Academy as punishment connected to a massive cheating scandal, prompting the New Jersey Democrat to defend her military service. Sherrill’s unredacted military records were also mistakenly released by a branch of the National Archives, prompting calls for investigations from her Democratic allies.\n \n\n   \n  In their final debate, Sherrill attempted to blame Ciattarelli for “tens of thousands” of opioid deaths in New Jersey, arguing that his medical publishing company produced materials misleading people about the risks of opioid abuse. Ciattarelli’s campaign strongly pushed back on the claim, at one point threatening to sue Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  Outside Democratic and Republican groups poured millions of dollars into the race, making it the most expensive gubernatorial contest in New Jersey history.

And then all of a sudden California says, ‘Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.’ And then now other states are jumping in.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom and other Democrats backing the measure have stressed that Proposition 50 reaffirms the state’s general support for independent redistricting, despite the current attempt to gerrymander the state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"19:59:00-05:00","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 67","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military, under the Trump administration, has conducted 16 strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans targeting suspected drug-smuggling vessels, resulting in 67 deaths and 17 boats destroyed.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted another strike against an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, killing two people, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has killed 67 people in 16 strikes that have destroyed 17 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-remains-gaza-hamas-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:28:00Z","title":"Hostage remains handed over Tuesday are those of dual US-Israeli citizen Itay Chen, Israel says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 4, 2025, Israel confirmed the receipt of the remains of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen and former Armored Corps staff sergeant, as part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal.

His remains were taken into Gaza after he was killed, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was the second of three sons, a former Boy Scout and an avid basketball player, his father Ruby Chen previously told CNN. Friends described him “as the center of attention wherever he went, always cheerful and full of jokes,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\n \n\n   \n  The office of the Israeli prime minister said the government “shares in the deep sorrow of the Chen family and of all the families of the fallen hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer comes after Hamas handed over the bodies of three deceased hostages on Sunday. US President Donald Trump confirmed one of them was Omer Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national killed in the initial Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Last Thursday, Hamas released the remains of two other hostages, identified as Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25.\n \n\n   \n  The solidity of the Trump-brokered ceasefire had previously been tested   after Hamas said it handed over the remains of three deceased individuals on October 28, but Israeli authorities were unable to identify them as belonging to any of the hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was resorting to “pathetic attempts to deceive us, the United States, and the world” and instructed the military to carry out “immediate, powerful strikes” in Gaza. Those strikes killed at least 104 Palestinians, including dozens of children, in what was the deadliest day since the beginning of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, however, the releases of the remains of hostages have proceeded as planned, and the ceasefire has largely held. In an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Trump said the ceasefire he helped broker is “not fragile” and was “very solid,” warning that “Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Israel has been rocked by a  scandal  surrounding Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, the military’s top lawyer tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the armed forces. She has been placed under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in Israel’s notorious Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024. In May of that year, CNN spoke to three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse at the prison. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/harvard-university-explosion-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:47:00-05:00","title":"Two Arrested in Connection with Explosion at Harvard Medical School, FBI Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two men, Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza, were arrested in connection with a weekend explosion at Harvard Medical School’s Goldenson building, where they reportedly lit Roman candle fireworks and detonated a large commercial firework in a wooden locker.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tips from the public led to the arrests Tuesday of two men who authorities say are responsible for a weekend explosion inside a Harvard Medical research lab — an act that one official called “selfish” and “shortsighted.”\n \n\n   \n  Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, both of Massachusetts,  were arrested  and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive a building belonging to an institution that receives federal financial assistance, according to a criminal complaint. It’s unclear whether the two have attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  It’s too early to speculate on the motive, as the investigation is ongoing, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  But a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN the two men filmed the explosion and later showed it to friends. The official added so far, the two men did not appear to be driven by political ideology.\n \n\n   \n  The men were arrested Tuesday morning at their homes, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge at the FBI’s Boston division. Members of the public had called authorities to identify them after police released surveillance camera images, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  The incident came after a tense year for Harvard students, teachers and staff who were thrust into the national spotlight amid the White House’s push to reshape higher education. Officials from Harvard and the White House have been in  discussions for months  about a high-dollar deal to restore all federal funding to the university and end its ongoing lawsuits against the administration.\n \n\n   \n    How the explosion unfolded\n \n\n   \n  An officer responded to the Goldenson building just before 3 a.m. ET Saturday and saw two people fleeing after a fire alarm was activated, according to Harvard police.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage circulated by police showed two masked people, one of them wearing what appeared to be a gray ski mask and the other a long face mask and black hoodie.\n \n\n   \n  The video, according to court documents, shows two people “lighting what appear to be roman candle fireworks,” around 2:24 a.m. The two then climbed over the fence and ended up near a construction area surrounding the building.\n \n\n   \n  A little over 10 minutes later, the two “climbed scaffolding erected beside the Goldenson Building and accessed the building’s roof,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:45 a.m., Harvard police received the fire alarm alert.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, the two made a stop on the fifth floor “before exiting the building through a first-floor emergency exit leading into a courtyard,” and then fled on foot in opposite directions, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  They also tried “to conceal or dispose of articles of clothing” that they had worn in the Goldenson Building, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  When authorities arrived, they found what is believed to be a large commercial firework that had been detonated inside a wooden locker, court documents allege.\n \n\n   \n  Docks called the incident “selfish” and “shortsighted.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s equally disturbing, these two men allegedly boasted about what they did to their friends,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  A  message sent  to the community from the Harvard Medical School Sunday afternoon said there was no structural damage to the building.\n \n\n   \n  “The small section of the fourth-floor hallway where the explosion took place has been cleared and is fully operational,” the message said. “There was no structural damage to the building, and all labs and equipment remain intact.”\n \n\n   \n  The Sunday message also said the building “will be fully open and accessible to all who work in the building.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/europe/russia-nuclear-burevestnik-poseidon-awards-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:01:00Z","title":"Putin hails developers of nuclear-powered Burevestnik missile, in latest signal to the West","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded developers of the Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon underwater torpedo at a Kremlin ceremony, calling both systems 'historic' and emphasizing their long-range capabilities and ability to evade missile defenses.

\nUpdated: \n        6:01 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has given state awards to the developers of the  Burevestnik  cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater torpedo, the latest signal in what analysts have cast as efforts by the Kremlin to discourage the West from supporting Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  At an awards ceremony in the Kremlin on Tuesday, Putin claimed the two nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons were of “historic significance” for Russia and “for the entire 21st century.”\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of flight range, the Burevestnik … has surpassed all known missile systems in the world,” Putin said in a speech, praising the state of Russia’s defense technology.\n \n\n   \n  Putin also said that Russia has begun serial production of the  Oreshnik , another nuclear-capable missile. Russia used the hypersonic Oreshnik in a strike on the Ukrainian region of Dnipro in November 2024 – the first time in history an intermediate-range ballistic missile has been used in battle.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony comes amid growing tension between Moscow and Washington, after US President Donald Trump – frustrated by Putin’s prevarications over ending the war in Ukraine – last month imposed  sanctions  on two Russian oil giants and cancelled a proposed  summit  with the Russian leader in  Hungary .\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s sanctions, Putin announced on October 26 that Russia had successfully tested the Burevestnik cruise missile. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin – wearing military garb – was shown meeting with Russia’s chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, who told the president that the Burevestnik flew 8,700 miles (14,000 kilometers) over 15 hours.\n \n\n   \n  On October 28, Putin claimed the Poseidon – another “invincible” Russian weapon with a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) – had been successfully tested.\n \n\n   \n  Neither weapon is new. Putin unveiled both weapons in 2018, and even announced a successful test of the Burevestnik in  2023 .\n \n\n   \n  But analysts say Russia is using previously announced missile technology to send new nuclear threats to the West, and the US in particular.\n \n\n   \n  “The repeated emphasis on the long range of the weapon and ability to overcome any missile defense system also indicates that the intended target would be the United States, not a regional adversary that Russia could strike with much cheaper shorter-range systems,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a report published Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The report noted the Trump administration’s plan to build a  “Golden Dome”  missile defense system to shield the US from foreign attacks. Although Putin did not explicitly reference the Golden Dome in his October 26 announcement of the Burevestnik test, he has repeatedly stressed the missile’s ability to evade missile defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Putin is using this test to create fear in the United States to discourage US decisionmakers from pursuing policies that threaten Russian interests,” the CSIS report said.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony in the Kremlin comes days after Trump  ordered  the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests. The US president said he gave the order “because of other countries’ testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  In his speech Tuesday, Putin claimed that Russia “is not threatening anyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia, like all other nuclear powers, is developing nuclear potential and its strategic potential. Everything we have been talking about now is work that was announced long ago,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/reaction-trump-cheney-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump, a longtime Cheney critic, keeps quiet on former vice president’s death","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the death of former Vice President Dick Cheney, President Donald Trump and the White House have remained largely silent, with no public statements, social media posts, or attendance at a funeral.

 Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While condolences for  former Vice President Dick Cheney  have poured in from both sides of the aisle,  President Donald Trump  has not addressed his death on Tuesday nor shared anything about it among his many posts on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Neither has Vice President JD Vance. The White House offered a muted reaction, including a perfunctory response from press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who told reporters at Tuesday’s press briefing that Trump was “aware” of Cheney’s death and noted that flags have been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  The reaction was in keeping with Trump’s long-standing disdain for the former vice president, which he voiced long before he ever campaigned and won on dismantling the GOP establishment at the crux of Cheney’s ascent to power.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I don’t like him now,” Trump said in a 2011  video  taped from his Trump Tower desk.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a hardline conservative,  endorsed  Trump’s 2016 run for president, but crossed the aisle in 2024 to endorse Kamala Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump-Cheney relationship deteriorated significantly after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The former vice president sharply  criticized  Trump as a “coward” and a threat to the republic in an ad supporting his daughter, then-Rep. Liz Cheney, in her 2022 reelection campaign, which she lost in the primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the attack.\n \n\n   \n  In  endorsing  Harris, Dick Cheney said in a statement that citizens “have a duty to put country above partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Tuesday did not respond to inquiries as to whether Trump planned to speak at Cheney’s funeral or if he had spoken with members of the Cheney family.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president is aware of the former vice president’s passing, and as you saw, flags have been lowered to half-staff in accordance with statutory law,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  White House flags were lowered hours after Cheney’s death was announced on Tuesday morning, but the moment was not accompanied by a presidential proclamation.\n \n\n   \n  Federal laws govern flying American flags at half-staff. According to the  Department of Veterans Affairs , flags at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels must fly at half-staff for 30 days after the death of a president or former president, and 10 days for a vice president, Supreme Court chief justice or speaker of the House. For former vice presidents, flags must fly at half-staff between the day of death and interment.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump took office on January 20, the White House flag was flying at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter, who died on December 29, 2024. Trump, who once called the Democrat a “nice man” but “terrible president,”  signed  a presidential proclamation within hours of his swearing-in, requiring the flag to be raised to full-staff on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  But flying the flag at half-staff for other officials is at the president’s discretion. Trump has extended the honor three times during his second term: to assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, to the victims of a school shooting at a Minneapolis church in August, and Pope Francis in April.\n \n\n   \n  Trump reflected on his relationship with Cheney briefly during a town hall with Tucker Carlson days before the 2024 election – weeks after Cheney endorsed Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised a little bit with Dick Cheney. I didn’t know him at all,” Trump said, adding that they had spoken after Trump  pardoned  ex-Cheney aide Scooter Libby in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He added: “I was a little surprised because I actually thought that Dick Cheney would go with me over his daughter and he didn’t. And you know what? I understand it. It’s your daughter and you go.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/airspace-controller-shortages","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00Z","title":"DOT May Close Parts of U.S. Airspace Due to Air Traffic Controller Shortages During Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Transportation faces significant operational challenges due to a shortage of air traffic controllers and TSA workers, who are required to work without pay.

certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it because we don’t have the air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  Controllers received a partial paycheck early in the shutdown, and last week missed one entirely. On Thursday, Duffy said, controllers will be sent another paystub that reads $0. He said many controllers cannot go without two paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers, like Transportation Security Administration workers, are essential employees and are required to work during federal government shutdowns despite not being paid. This past week, TSA and Federal Aviation Administration employees not showing up for work caused massive security wait times in Houston and delays at airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t just go find money and pay air traffic controllers,” Duffy said. “That’s not the way our constitution works and our government works.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the DOT hired 2,000 controllers to try and address a decades-long shortage, but Duffy said the shutdown “will have an impact.”\n \n\n   \n  “These young people have a choice to make: do they want to go into a profession where they can have a shutdown and they cannot be paid? That’s affected our pipeline,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy also reaffirmed if the airspace wasn’t safe, the DOT would “shut it down.” He said some controllers may work two positions versus one because of the callouts, which is allowed and safe, but does pose a greater risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We delay flights, we cancel or tell airlines to cancel flights if we don’t have enough controllers to effectively and safely manage our skies, Duffy said. “With this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system. There is more risk in the system.”\n \n\n   \n  While  most aviation experts  agree it is safe to fly during the shutdown, the union representing air traffic controllers, which has pushed hard for the government to reopen, says each day it stays closed, the less safe the system gets.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on CNN News Central Monday. “We’re supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, ‘how do I pay my rent?’”\n \n\n   \n    TSA also sees staffing shortages\n \n\n   \n  TSA workers under the Department of Homeland Security are also going without pay and some of them are not showing up for work.\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport warned travelers of up to three-hour waits for security screening this week. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport warned of long lines last month caused by the shortage of workers.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, Delta Air Lines, whose largest hub is Atlanta, said it is utilizing a “years-long partnership” with TSA to assist workers near screening checkpoints and “free up” certified TSA screeners to process passengers.\n \n\n   \n  “Delta Air Lines implores Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government so that our air traffic controllers, TSA and CBP officers charged with the safety and efficiency of our national airspace can collect the paychecks they deserve,” a Delta spokesperson said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00-05:00","title":"The US government remains shut down: Here's how long the current shutdown has been going on and a look at recent shutdowns since 1981","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government remains in a full shutdown as of November 4, 2025, due to the failure to pass 12 essential appropriations bills.

Here’s how long the current shutdown has been going on:\n \n\n   \n  The last time the government shut down — which started on December 22, 2018, and went until January 25, 2019 — it lasted 35 days. It cost the United States an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n    Here are all the government shutdowns since 1981\n \n\n   \n  US agencies were first instructed in the early 1980s to stop normal operations during government funding lapses, and resume operations when Congress appropriated more money.   The first federal government shutdown happened in 1976, according to CNN research.\n \n\n   \n  While government shutdowns have become less common in recent decades — there have been six since 1990 — an increasingly partisan Washington has left Congress unable to resolve sticking points on spending for longer periods of time.\n \n\n   \n  With Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing one of the  narrowest House majorities in history,  and the GOP lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate  filibuster , the path to avoiding a shutdown was murky in the 11th hour as negotiations stalled.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Tami Luhby  has more on which government services are expected to halt , and which are likely continuing, during this shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    The last government shutdown\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown that began in December 2018 was a partial shutdown, where Congress had approved annual funding for certain agencies, allowing them to continue operations while other federal departments went dark. During that time, an estimated 800,000 people were employed at the shuttered federal agencies, and about 300,000 of those were furloughed, meaning they were not paid and asked not to report to work, according to the CBO.\n \n\n   \n  The rest were considered exempt from furlough, meaning they needed to report to work but could not receive pay. Both furloughed and exempted employees received backpay when their agencies reopened after the funding agreement was passed.\n \n\n   \n  The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the US government. That means this is a full government shutdown.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/obesity-drugs-trump-pharmaceutical-companies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration nears deals with pharmaceutical companies to offer obesity drugs for $149 a month","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is nearing agreements with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to offer their obesity drugs—including Wegovy, Zepbound, Mounjaro, and Ozempic—at a reduced monthly price of $149, significantly lower than their current list prices of $1,000 to $1,350.

The list price of the drugs range from roughly $1,000 to $1,350, though the price consumers pay depends on their insurance and on discounts.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump is expected to announce the deals as soon as Thursday, though the people familiar with the negotiations cautioned that they are not finalized and that officials are still working through key policy details.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that “discussion about deals that have not been officially announced by the administration should be regarded as speculation.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday declined to confirm the planned announcement, but said a deal that cuts the cost of the obesity drugs was “something that the administration has been engaged and looking into.”\n \n\n   \n  The negotiations over Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s obesity drugs represent perhaps the highest-profile element of a broader White House push to cut drug prices by striking individual deals with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n \n\n   \n  The “Most Favored Nation” initiative has so far resulted in agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and other companies to sell certain products directly to consumers at a reduced price — often in exchange for relief from the threat of targeted tariffs.  Eli Lilly  and  Novo Nordisk  already provide their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to consumers who pay cash.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has fixated in particular on striking a deal for GLP-1 medications that have exploded in popularity in recent years for helping with weight loss and a range of chronic conditions. The president has referred to them in both public and private as the “fat-loss drug.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150,” Trump said of the GLP-1 drugs during a mid-October event highlighting a separate drug price deal, prompting US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz to jump in and emphasize that the negotiations were still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Endpoints News first  reported  that deals were approaching the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly which of the companies’ drugs will be sold for $149 and whether there will be restrictions on consumers’ access to them. The deals are related to a pilot program that CMS is in the final stages of developing aimed at capping the cost of the obesity drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  The expected deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk follow a yearslong debate on both sides of the aisle over whether Medicare and Medicaid should cover the pricey drugs. The Biden administration last year officially proposed expanding coverage of them, though the plan was not finalized before Trump took office. The Trump administration said in April that it was  halting  the proposal but left the door open to consider future policy options for covering the drugs.\n \n\n   \n  Also, notably, Ozempic and Wegovy were selected in January for second round of  Medicare drug price negotiations , which is expected to result in savings for the program and, possibly, for enrollees depending on their drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vehemently opposed efforts to make the medications more accessible, telling Fox News  ahead of last November’s election  that Novo Nordisk — which makes Ozempic — was “counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.” But since joining the administration, he has struck a far more accommodating tone, expressing openness to patients using them if prior efforts to improve their health have failed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/judges-could-inspect-justice-department-operations","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:02:00Z","title":"Judges Want to Peek Under the Hood at the Justice Department, Setting Up Another Showdown with Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal judges are conducting a sweeping investigation into the Justice Department’s internal decision-making processes, particularly concerning high-profile prosecutions of political figures like James Comey and Letitia James, and the case of migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

want to peek under the hood at the Justice Department, setting up another showdown with Trump \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:02 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is facing several court orders that land it in a position it often seeks to avoid: Revealing the private statements of its top political leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Judges’ attempts to confidentially review executive branch records and hold hearings where Justice Department attorneys could take the stand are bearing down in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  In one case, regarding the migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Justice Department is fighting to keep Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche from having to testify about prosecutorial decision-making in a hearing next month.\n \n\n   \n  And this week, federal Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will look closer at Eastern District of Virginia US Attorney Lindsey Halligan’s work with a grand jury before the recent indictment of Trump political opponents James Comey and Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  The examples in court reflect how trust has been lost by the Justice Department this year while President Donald Trump and his top allies and appointees have repeatedly attacked the courts and challenged even temporary orders with emergency appeals.\n \n\n   \n  If officials are forced to testify and the Justice Department hands over internal communications, the proceedings may expose the Justice Department’s inner workings in a way that could have implications for multiple ongoing, high-profile and intensely challenged criminal cases.\n \n\n   \n  “What a mess,” said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams about the latest turns in the criminal cases.\n \n\n   \n  “The government always plays with fire whenever it takes an aggressive action that might end up in court one day,” he added. “When that happens, they really do risk having secrets and strategy that they’d rather not have in plain view.”\n \n\n   \n  An order from Currie on Tuesday also puts more scrutiny on Halligan’s handling of Comey’s indictment. The judge said she wanted to review more complete statements than the Justice Department already has provided from the grand jury proceedings in Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a US attorney to single-handedly secure indictments before a grand jury – which Halligan did against both Comey and James days after Trump appointed her to the top prosecutor job. But it’s also somewhat unusual for a federal judge to demand looking at internal records privately, called “in camera.” Typically, prosecutors can summarize their positions for courts without judges needing to double-check or dig further.\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments from both defense teams and the Justice Department on November 13 about Halligan’s role in the cases.\n \n\n   \n  The defense teams hope to have the criminal cases dismissed, arguing that Halligan doesn’t have the authority because the Eastern District of Virginia hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed US attorney for longer than the 120 days interim appointees are allowed, and that the former Trump personal attorney and White House staffer hadn’t come from another job within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said in a court order on Monday she “finds it necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.” And in an atypical follow-up on Tuesday, Currie said the Justice Department, in initially providing records to the judge, didn’t include transcripts that captured remarks Halligan made before and after a witness testified to the grand jury in the Comey case.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also wanted to see the transcript of an initial attempt to secure an indictment, where the grand jury rejected one charge against Comey. The ex-FBI director was ultimately charged with two counts: making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n    Tension in Tennessee \n \n\n   \n  In the criminal case against the mistakenly deported then criminally charged Abrego Garcia, federal Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. in Nashville ordered prosecutors to send their internal communications to him. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys contend he has been unfairly prosecuted for political reasons.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing where the No. 2 leader of the Justice Department may have to testify is now scheduled for early December. The judge wants to privately review communications between Blanche’s office in Washington, DC, and the Tennessee-based federal prosecutors’ office, which charged Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also told the Justice Department to send to the court under seal other records it might have related to the federal government’s decision to prosecute him rather than deport him this spring. He was returned to the US after being wrongfully deported to a Salvadoran prison and then was charged with human smuggling linked to a traffic stop years ago. He is fighting the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department submitted some documents under seal last week. But Crenshaw in recent days said they needed “more time to finish collecting and producing documents.”\n \n\n   \n  Crenshaw said that the Justice Department said it had no documents “for entire categories of information requested by the court,” but then said “the Government certainly has additional responsive documents” on its decision to prosecute Abrego Garcia over deport.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government shall continue to solicit responsive documents” and keep sending them to the judge, Crenshaw has ordered.\n \n\n   \n  But the matter isn’t totally resolved. The judge’s efforts to weigh whether Abrego Garcia was unfairly prosecuted will continue in a larger standoff slated for next month in Crenshaw’s courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  Abrego Garcia’s attorneys seek to question under oath Justice Department officials, including a former prosecutor on his criminal case in Tennessee who had resigned, and three attorneys from the Deputy Attorney General’s office, including Blanche himself.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors on the case have said Blanche’s and his deputies’ testimony would be unnecessary, despite Blanche speaking on national TV about the decision to charge Abrego Garcia and return him to the US from El Salvador. They also argue official decision-making should be protected from being disclosed in court because of executive branch confidentiality.\n \n\n   \n  “Given that undisputed evidence shows that there is no link between the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and the decision to prosecute, there is no basis for subpoenas seeking to compel testimony from high-ranking officials in that office, including the Deputy Attorney General himself,” prosecutors wrote to the court on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the case say, however, the former acting US Attorney in Nashville, Homeland Security investigators and a state trooper who stopped Abrego Garcia for speeding on the interstate highway in 2022 could testify.\n \n\n   \n  The department has also indicated it has wanted to deport Abrego Garcia imminently, which could end the criminal proceedings, and Abrego Garcia’s attorneys are advocating to have his charges dismissed if Blanche won’t testify.\n \n\n   \n  “The very officials whose testimony is required to meet that burden” to show in court the case should stay alive, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys wrote this week, “are resolutely unwilling to show up. For anyone interested in good government, that is profoundly troubling.”\n \n\n   \n  The depth Crenshaw ultimately decides to probe into top Justice Department decision-making could factor into the Comey and James cases, too.\n \n\n   \n  Both of those defendants are fighting their charges, and asking judges to dismiss their cases because they say Trump unfairly pushed for their indictments.\n \n\n   \n  “Objective evidence,” Comey’s team wrote to the court, noting dozens of angry social media posts the president has made about Comey, “establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey’s public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite. Such a vindictive prosecution serves no legitimate government interest and contradicts fundamental constitutional values.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department this week argued that years of  Trump commenting on social media  that he wanted to see Comey indicted didn’t mean the Justice Department was unfairly targeting the former FBI Director with criminal charges now.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday afternoon, federal prosecutors also told the court it didn’t immediately plan to hand over documents to defense lawyers related to the decision to charge James with mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors say, according to the filing, that James shouldn’t have more access to their internal records unless there are further court proceedings.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/federal-immigration-enforcement-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00Z","title":"Judge hears testimony about crowded cells and overflowing toilets at Chicago-area immigration site","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. District Judge heard testimony from detained individuals at the Broadview immigration detention center in Chicago, where they described severe conditions including overcrowding (up to 150 people in a cell), no beds, water that tasted like sewer, overflowing toilets, and lack of basic supplies.

EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A judge heard testimony Tuesday about overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer” at a  Chicago-area building  that serves as a key detention spot for people rounded up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  People who were held at the building in Broadview, just outside Chicago, offered rare public  accounts about the conditions  there as U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman considers ordering changes at a site that has become a flashpoint for protests and confrontations with federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want anyone else to live what I lived through,” said Felipe Agustin Zamacona, 47, an Amazon driver and Mexican immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Zamacona said there were 150 people in a holding cell. Desperate to lie down to sleep, he said he once took the spot of another man who got up to use the toilet.\n \n\n   \n  And the water? Zamacona said he tried to drink from a sink but it “tasted like sewer.”\n \n\n   \n  A lawsuit filed last week accuses the government of denying proper access to food, water and medical care, and coercing people to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and  faced deportation , the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.”\n \n\n   \n  Before testimony began, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said the allegations were “disgusting.”\n \n\n   \n  “To have to sleep on a floor next to an overflowing toilet — that’s obviously unconstitutional,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.”\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  The building has been managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for decades. But amid the Chicago-area crackdown, it has been used to process people for detention or deportation.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led the Chicago immigration operation, said criticism was unfounded.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’re doing a great job out there,” he told The Associated Press during  an interview  this week.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying with the help of a translator, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. Like Zamacona, he said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just really bad. … It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara testified from Honduras, separated from two children who remain in the U.S. She said she was held at Broadview for five days in October and recalled using a garbage bag to clear a clogged toilet.\n \n\n   \n  “They gave us nothing that had to do with cleaning. Absolutely nothing,” Guevara said.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness,  Ruben Torres Maldonado , said he slept on the concrete floor and would fill water bottles to use as pillows.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said he could make a decision Wednesday on the request for a restraining order.\n \n\n   \n   For months  advocates have raised concerns about conditions at Broadview, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.\n \n\n   \n  The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/sandwich-thrower-case-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00Z","title":"It Smelled of Onions and Mustard: Border Patrol Officer Hit by Sandwich Says as Trial Begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a federal trial in Washington, DC, Sean Dunn is accused of misdemeanor assault for throwing a Subway sandwich at Border Patrol officer Greg Lairmore in July 2025.

EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “He did it. He threw the sandwich.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s how the defense counsel for Sean Dunn, the man who threw a sub-style sandwich at a Border Patrol officer in Washington, DC, this summer began the federal trial against him Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The United States government, Dunn’s attorney Julia Gatto told the jury, “turned that moment, a thrown sandwich, into a criminal case. A federal criminal case charging a federal criminal offense.”\n \n\n   \n  The case serves as a certain symbol in the backlash the Trump administration’s deployment of federal troops in DC this summer faced from residents. The sandwich-throwing incident also became a moment of resistance in the city, with spray-painted posters popping up around the capital in the wake of the alleged assault.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the Border Patrol officer testified about his experience.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Lairmore told the jury that Dunn “became really irritated and started yelling obscenities” at him and other officers that night before throwing “a subway style sandwich at me that struck me in the chest.”\n \n\n   \n  “It smelled of onions and mustard,” Lairmore said of the sandwich, which “exploded all over my chest.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can you tell if it’s a turkey sandwich?’\n \n\n   \n  Another attorney for Dunn, Sabrina Shroff, pressed Lairmore on that response, showing a photo of the sandwich on the ground, still wrapped in the Subway paper.\n \n\n   \n  “Can you tell if it’s a turkey sandwich?” Sabrina pressed, emphasizing that the sandwich remained wrapped. “Lettuce? Tomatoes?”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore said he could not tell from the picture, but claimed he had mustard stains on his uniform and pieces of the sandwich hanging from his radio equipment that night.\n \n\n   \n  “From the photo it looks bent and out of shape,” the officer said of the sandwich.\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore also said he had received gag gifts related to the sandwich incident from some of his colleagues, including a plush sandwich and a patch that said “felony footlong.”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore chuckled when he described the gifts. Of the stuffed toy sandwich, he said, “I put it on top of my shelf in the office.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the incident and after leaving the Subway restaurant, Dunn soon became “red-faced and enraged,” Lairmore testified, “calling me and my colleagues all kinds of names. Saying we were fascist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond. That’s his constitutional right to express his opinion,” Lairmore, a division chief who has been with Customs and Border Protection for 23 years, said.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, body-worn camera footage taken from the night of Dunn’s arrest was played for the jury, including a portion where Dunn told an officer: “I was trying to draw them away from where they were. I succeeded.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘You can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad’\n \n\n   \n  As neither party disputes the basic facts of the case, jurors will need to determine whether the sandwich-throwing is enough to convict Dunn on the misdemeanor assault charge.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I understand you may all have views of the federal law enforcement presence in DC,” Assistant US Attorney John Parron told the jury during opening statements Tuesday. “And that’s fine, we’re not trying to convince you otherwise. But respectfully, that’s not what this case is about. This case is about the fact that you can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad.”\n \n\n   \n  “When we have disputes, we settle them verbally,” Parron added, concluding that Dunn threw the sandwich and “forcibly assaulted him.”\n \n\n   \n  Gatto argued that the throwing of the sandwich served “as an exclamation mark at the end of a verbal outburst,” from Dunn, who was upset by the surge of federal officers in DC and the Trump administrations’ deportation efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “He is not a fan. He thinks recent immigration enforcement is racist,” Gatto said, adding that Dunn saw the local federal takeover of DC law enforcement as “fascism.”\n \n\n   \n  Of the charge her client faces, Gatto said, “bodily injury, that’s the standard.”\n \n\n   \n  “They will not come close to convincing you beyond a reasonable doubt the conduct was forcible,” Gatto concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The trial, which presiding Judge Carl Nichols called the “simplest case” in the history of the world, will continue Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A DC jury recently acquitted a different resident who was also charged with assault for allegedly moving her knee up toward an officer while being restrained after filming officers as they made immigration-related arrests.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated to include additional testimony. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/entertainment/david-harbour-lily-allen-millie-bobby-brown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:56:00Z","title":"David Harbour talks ‘pain, slip ups and mistakes’ amid split from Lily Allen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Harbour, best known for his role in 'Stranger Things', discusses in a recent interview with Esquire Spain how personal pain, mistakes, and emotional challenges are essential components of growth and wisdom.

    \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  David Harbour has some things to say about his life.\n \n\n   \n  In a recently published interview with  Esquire Spain , the “Stranger Things” actor was asked whether he would change anything – about his life, professionally or personally.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s such a hard question – the question of regret, or something,” Harbour told the publication. “I would change either everything or nothing.”\n \n\n   \n  The 50-year-old framed it all a part of one’s “path.”\n \n\n   \n  “You either accept your path completely and realise that even the pain and the slip-ups and the mistakes are all part of the journey, and that there’s truth and growth, wisdom and deeper empathy and connection in all that,” he said. “It’s kind of like a house of cards, the minute you try to change one thing you kind of have to change it all.”\n \n\n   \n  His thoughts are being dissected in light of his much-publicized split with  singer and songwriter Lily Allen .\n \n\n   \n  The couple wed in Las Vegas in 2020 and are now estranged. Allen’s latest album, last month’s “West End Girl,” was inspired in part by their relationship and its demise, she told Vogue.\n \n\n   \n  “There are things that are on the record that I experienced within my marriage, but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel,”  Allen said. \n \n\n   \n  The album has been making waves for its candid recounting of certain aspects of her marriage, including instances of emotional infidelity and some  other gritty details .\n \n\n   \n  Harbour has also been in the headlines  because of a report  that his “Stranger Things” costar, Millie Bobby Brown, filed a claim of harassment against him before they started filming the final season of their hit series.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has not confirmed that such a claim was made and has reached out to representatives for both stars for comment.\n \n\n   \n  While Harbour didn’t directly address any potential issues with either Allen or Brown in the Esquire interview, he did muse that “if you’ve never been through anything, what do you really have to offer?”\n \n\n   \n  “If I were to change anything, I’d change everything, and just make my life happy and silly and like, whatever, and then I wouldn’t be an artist anymore,” he said. “And that would suck.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/world/2-french-nationals-freed-from-iranian-prison-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:13:00Z","title":"Two French Nationals Freed from Iranian Prison After More Than 3 Years in Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two French nationals, Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, were arrested in Iran in May 2022 on spying charges related to alleged cooperation with French intelligence and Israel.

bipartisan talks pick up steam \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Ted  Barrett, Adam Cancryn, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:44 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With Congress now tied for its longest-ever shutdown, a small group of fed-up lawmakers in Washington are furiously trying to end the standoff as soon as this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those members insist there’s real momentum this time. Yet the potential off-ramp doesn’t appear to deliver Democrats any real win on their biggest demand of the shutdown: health care.\n \n\n   \n  Talks over reopening the government are focused on putting together a funding package and giving Democrats a stand-alone vote to extend expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to sources familiar with the high-stakes negotiations. The deal would also include a pathway to move ahead with three bills to fund major agencies of the federal government through next September.\n \n\n   \n  But given that there is no guarantee that an extension of ACA subsidies will pass the Senate – much less the House — it’s unclear whether enough Democrats will accept that proposal to reopen the government, the sources said. So it is bound to prompt sharp division among Democrats about whether a vote is enough after the damaging consequences of the shutdown standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Susan Collins, the Senate’s top GOP spending leader, has been involved in a flurry of conversations in recent days to end the impasse by funding both parties’ priorities in bipartisan year-long funding bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I do believe that we are finally making progress. It’s too soon to declare that this nightmare of a shutdown is over, but I’m very cautiously hopeful that it will be resolved by the end of this week,” the Maine Republican told.\n \n\n   \n  There’s still a long way to go. Party leaders are still not talking. On Tuesday, the Senate failed its 14th vote on the GOP’s stopgap plan to reopen the government. And neither side expects tangible progress on Election Day with key races from New Jersey to California on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune is not yet certain the end is in sight. He said Monday he is “optimistic” but not necessarily “confident” bipartisan senators will reach a deal to fund the government by week’s end.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on sort of my gut of how things operate, I think we’re getting close to an off ramp,” Thune said, but he cautioned: “This is unlike any other government shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune also acknowledged Monday that the Senate will likely have to draft a new stopgap bill — replacing the House’s version that goes through November 21 — in order to buy Congress more time to pass those full-year spending bills. Democrats see this as an opening to support something other than the same GOP funding plan, and to have input on the new version. (One person involved in the discussions said the likely end date for the new bill would be January, though spending leaders like Collins want Congress to aim for around Christmas instead.)\n \n\n   \n  That semblance of movement comes as shutdown damage is quickly racking up. Already on day 35 of the shutdown,  food banks nationwide are swamped  with new families, furloughed workers are  applying for unemployment benefits  and air traffic is  snarling across the country .\n \n\n   \n  Collins and others involved in the talks have been mostly secretive about exactly who and what is involved. Leadership in both parties had for days largely downplayed the talks, though they are being kept up to speed by those involved, according to one person involved in the talks. For the first time, Collins said Democrats are now contributing to these appropriations talks, but there’s still a huge problem — it doesn’t solve the looming health care cliff next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if that’ll work or not. … This has nothing to do with health care, and that’s what my Democratic colleagues have harped on,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats will soon be faced with a key question: What will they accept from Republicans after their month-long push to extend expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies? Thune has publicly offered Democrats an up-or-down vote on those subsidies — but Democrats have said it is not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about her view, Sen. Elizabeth Warren stressed that Republicans need to sit down and negotiate and signaled that her party would not cave just because the shutdown effects were getting more painful.\n \n\n   \n  “He thinks he can use hungry children as a bargaining chip against Democrats, saying, in effect, that it’s only Democrats who care whether or not kids go hungry,” the Massachusetts Democrat said. “Well, it is Democrats who care, and it’s Americans who care. Republicans should come to the table and negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal Democratic debate comes at a delicate time for the party, with internal cracks already beginning to show over the momentum of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s mayoral election this week, which has bolstered progressives while ringing alarm bells for its more establishment wing.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered an  even starker  warning to Democrats in an op-ed over the weekend, warning the party not to cave to  President Donald Trump  on the shutdown: “This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Running out the clock’\n \n\n   \n  There’s one notable Republican absent in the discussions: Trump, who returned from a week abroad to find little had changed on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have largely steered clear of major visible involvement in the day-to-day dynamics of the shutdown, consulting frequently with Republican congressional leaders but letting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Thune dictate much of the party’s direction. Trump aides have sought instead to demonstrate that the administration is still pushing ahead on major priorities and policy announcements.\n \n\n   \n  Yet behind the scenes, officials have grown increasingly antsy as the shutdown drags on far longer than any of them expected.  Polling shows  Americans still placing significant blame on Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, complicating a messaging war that the White House initially anticipated it would decisively win.\n \n\n   \n  The health care rate hikes that Democrats initially shut down the government over more than a month ago are also now starting to hit consumers, further amplifying the issue at a moment in which voters are already unhappy with the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, officials have had running debates over the administration’s health care platform, consulting with GOP lawmakers and outside policy experts in preparation for post-shutdown talks with Democrats over the restoration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But those conversations have only progressed so far, stymied by the White House’s own hardline position against any negotiations during that shutdown. That stance, people involved in the discussions said, has made it difficult for the administration to counter Democrats’ attacks on health care, beyond offering vague assurances that officials are developing a health plan — a well-worn promise the GOP has failed to deliver on for nearly a decade.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s created a range of critical unknowns that under the current stalemate will go unanswered until the shutdown is over. Among them: what policies could win bipartisan support, the level of appetite on Capitol Hill for negotiating a broader health reform package, and what the health care landscape will look like whenever the shutdown is finally over.\n \n\n   \n  “We can come up with the policy in 30 seconds,” said one of the people involved in the discussions. “It’s just a question of what politically is going to be acceptable to the Republicans and what Democrats are going to think is enough of a fig leaf to move it forward.”\n \n\n   \n  “People see that there’s an issue that has to be fixed,” added GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “The speaker and Thune have both said this is something they want to address. The willingness is there,” Garbarino told CNN last week. “But the fact that nobody’s talking to each other right now, because they haven’t opened the government, it’s kind of running out the clock.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/dinosaur-hadrosaur-tail-injuries-sex","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00Z","title":"Mating injuries may lead scientists to identify dinosaurs’ sex","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research published in iScience proposes that healing injuries on the tail vertebrae of hadrosaurs—specifically at the base of the tail—may indicate mating behavior, with males mounting females during reproduction.

Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paleontologists have long wrestled with how to differentiate between male and female dinosaurs based on their fossils.\n \n\n   \n  But new research may bring scientists closer to identifying the sex of one group of  dinosaur.\n \n\n   \n  Hadrosaurs, also known as duck-billed dinosaurs, were common during the Late Cretaceous Period (100.5 to 66 million years ago), and the bones of these herbivores have been found across multiple continents.\n \n\n   \n  Some hadrosaur fossils show evidence of healing from traumatic bone injuries, all in the same location: on their vertebrae past the base of the tail.\n \n\n   \n  No soft tissues preserving evidence of dinosaur reproductive organs have been found in the fossil record, and differences observed in fossils are often thought to be due to species or age, rather than sex. Additionally, evidence of dinosaurs containing fossilized eggs has been hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  The authors of a  new study  published Tuesday in the journal iScience believe the injuries occurred during mating — and they could be used to indicate which fossils belong to female hadrosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be a game changer since it will enable other questions to be answered about differences between male and female dinosaurs,” said lead study author Dr. Filippo Bertozzo, a researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences’ Operational Directorate Earth and History of Life.\n \n\n   \n    Identifying a pattern in fossils\n \n\n   \n  Canadian paleontologist Darren H. Tanke first noticed the injuries on hadrosaur vertebrae on bones he discovered in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park throughout the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  Tanke’s original hypothesis was that they were caused by male hadrosaurs mounting females during the mating process, but he based his claims largely on fossils found in Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo noticed the same injury while studying a fossil belonging to the hadrosaur species Olorotitan arharensis, during a research trip to Russia in 2019. He was working on his PhD about disease in duckbilled dinosaurs while at Queen’s University Belfast. Bertozzo invited Tanke to join him in conducting new research.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to support behavioral claims, you need to have an extensive dataset able to possibly cover bias from fossilization, preservation, and collection,” Bertozzo said. “Also, the dinosaur biomechanical simulations weren’t as developed as those of today, and Darren couldn’t test his hypothesis.”\n \n\n   \n  Together, the researchers and their collaborators analyzed nearly 500 tail vertebrae across different hadrosaur species kept at museums in North America, Europe and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries and deformities they discovered on the middle part of the tail across different specimens were strikingly similar.\n \n\n   \n  “At the base of the tail, between the sacrum and the mid-point of the tail, the neural spines (the elongated bars atop the vertebra, what we call the “spinous process” in human anatomy) are broken on their tip, sometimes along the main body of the spine,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The tips were either tilted, swollen, inclined or even missing — meaning the injury caused the tip to break off and become reabsorbed by the body, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries were visible on several vertebrae for each specimen, suggesting the damage was spread along the main line of the tail, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The team carried out multiple simulations to see if the injuries could have been sustained through other activities during the dinosaurs’ daily lives, like accidentally stepping on each other’s tails, muscular strain during motion, fighting, being hunted, feeding or walking. But none of the scenarios would have consistently produced the injuries seen on the fossils, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the authors think the males may have mounted the females , who were lying on their sides, and pressed down on the females’ tails during mating, accidentally breaking the neural spines.\n \n\n   \n  “The mating hypothesis is the one that, at the moment, best explains our observations and data,” Bertozzo said. “The best evidence is the fact that we find this condition in many different species in different localities and times, suggesting it wasn’t something species-specific, but rather an event that would be conservative across all of them, happening to all of them, that is mating.”\n \n\n   \n  The injuries also didn’t appear to be fatal because signs of healing, and even evidence of a second injury, were visible.\n \n\n   \n  “Aggressively pursuing a female during reproduction might sound evolutionary disadvantageous for the continuation of the species but we already witness similar occurrences in many modern species, such as in sea lions, turtles, and some species of birds,” said study coauthor Gareth Arnott, professor in the school of biological sciences at Queen’s University Belfast, in a statement. “Reproductive competition is one of the most complicated topics in animal biology, especially for extinct species.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Albert Prieto-Márquez, a researcher in the dinosaur ecosystems research group at the Autonomous University of Barcelona’s Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology, believes the consistent injury pattern of healed middle tail fractures is most likely a genuine signal, rather than coincidence. He was not involved in the study, and applauds the creative insight of the researchers, but believes more evidence is needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, we can’t identify male and female dinosaurs just by looking at tail injuries,” he said. “To be sure, we’d need to find the same pattern in specimens that we know are female, for example with eggs or medullary bone preserved.”\n \n\n   \n  Medullary bone is temporary tissue that forms inside a cavity in long bones of birds and dinosaurs to provide calcium for eggshells, and was previously used in research to  identify a pregnant Tyrannosaurus rex  in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  For example, in chickens, medullary bone forms one to two weeks before the first egg is laid, and is reabsorbed about three weeks after the last egg is laid, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  If the same pattern occurred in dinosaurs, any containing this evidence would have died within a time range of about five weeks during the reproduction period, the authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Telling female from male\n \n\n   \n  If the hypothesis can be proven, it could open up a whole new way to understand complete hadrosaur fossils that bear such injuries, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  “This might bring a cascade of implications, such as testing whether skull crests vary between sexes, or identify anatomical features that were previously assigned to new species,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But more data is required. Although the team compiled a large dataset, they are eager to study fossils from China and South America to continue their comparisons. They also want to use more powerful computer simulations to include tail movements and muscle volumes across different injury scenarios, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo is also curious to see if the injuries are present in other types of dinosaurs, like long-necked sauropods. He was surprised not to find similar lesions in iguanodons, which were ancestors of hadrosaurs and are also very common in the fossil record.\n \n\n   \n  “The story is just at the beginning, and I hope ours is only one of the initial steps to better understand this aspect of the life of dinosaurs,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Determining male from female dinosaurs based on bones requires a high burden of proof, something that has historically been difficult, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who did not participate in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The authors have laid out their case and I think they provide a compelling argument, but as with so many aspects of dinosaur behavior, we just weren’t around tens of millions of years ago to observe them as real animals, so there will always be some degree of doubt, some degree of uncertainty in these interpretations,” he said. “We often just can’t tell the boys from the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the Hokkaido University Museum in Japan, found the study to be one of the most imaginative he’s seen in recent dinosaur paleobiology and believes the modeling in the study rules out other possible causes. While Kobayashi has  discovered new species of hadrosaurs , he was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, while Kobayashi finds the hypothesis intriguing, he regards it as a bold starting point rather than conclusive evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “This study opens a fascinating window into the private lives of dinosaurs,” he wrote in an email. “Even if not all the conclusions hold, it shows that bones can preserve traces of behavior we never thought we’d see. It’s exciting to think that even the scars of these ancient creatures can reveal moments of their most intimate lives, quite literally, the ‘love life’ of dinosaurs written in their bones.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/uk/england-train-stabbing-driver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:09:00-05:00","title":"‘Heroic’ actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a stabbing attack on a high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train traveling from Peterborough to London, a 32-year-old suspect, Anthony Williams, was arrested just 11 minutes after the first emergency call at 7:39 p.m. on November 4, 2025.

actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There were just 11 minutes between the moment British police received an emergency call about a  stabbing on a train  heading to London and the moment the suspect was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Eleven victims were hospitalized in the attack, including one railway worker who is in critical but stable condition, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have said the casualties would have been far worse if not for the actions of the “heroic” railway worker who tried to stop the attacker on the train and the driver who arranged for the train to be diverted to a nearby station.\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train, which was taking passengers from northern England to the British capital on Saturday evening, had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. The first emergency call to Cambridgeshire police was at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time. By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train worker, who was critically injured after confronting the attacker, has been named as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for LNER for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “In a moment of crisis, Sam did not hesitate as he stepped forward to protect those around him,” LNER managing director David Horne said. “His actions were incredibly brave, and we are so proud of him, and of all our colleagues who acted with such courage that evening.”\n \n\n   \n  His family added in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday paid tribute to him saying he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Three other casualties remain stable in the hospital, BTP said in an update on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, served in the Royal Navy for 17 years, according to LNER.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related. Mahmood said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning.

administration advancing UN resolution for Gaza security force, source says \n       \n  By Eugenia Yosef, Tal Shalev, Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration is working on a United Nations Security Council resolution to deploy a multinational force to Gaza to uphold the US-brokered ceasefire deal, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The details of a temporary security force in charge of demilitarizing Gaza and training a new Palestinian police force are under discussion as part of the work on the resolution, according to the source. US troops would not be part of the force on the ground in Gaza, instead operating in a coordination role outside of the territory.\n \n\n   \n  Early drafts of the resolution have been shared with other members of the Security Council, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Setting up an international stabilization force (ISF) is a key part of Trump’s  20-point  Gaza ceasefire plan, but many of the nations considering taking part have made clear that they would only join under the mandate of a UN resolution.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said while visiting Israel  last month  that some of the potential participants would only join the force if it had “some sort of international mandate,” adding that this could take the form of a UN resolution or an “international agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  Once established, the ISF would operate under a unified command in close coordination with Israel and Egypt, the source told CNN. The US has established a coordination center in southern Israel to manage the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan, including the planned reconstruction effort and the entry of humanitarian aid. According to US Central Command, nearly 40 different nations and international organizations have representation at the coordination center.\n \n\n   \n  The ISF, working together with a trained Palestinian police force, will stabilize the security situation in Gaza and ensure the demilitarization of the enclave, according to the draft resolution. That includes the destruction of military infrastructure used by Hamas, a step that risks putting the new force in direct conflict with the militant organization, which has worked to re-establish its authority since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The  US-brokered ceasefire plan  also calls for the international force to carry out the disarmament of Hamas, but countries have been reluctant to agree to such a task.\n \n\n   \n  Several Muslim-majority nations that are  considering participation in the ISF  met in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the mission. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who attended the meeting, told a news conference that the countries will decide whether to participate in the mission depending on the definition of the force and the UN mandate.\n \n\n   \n  “We are ready to shoulder the burden for peace. We are ready to make any sacrifice. But… it’s crucial that the documents and framework that emerge are of a quality we can clearly support. Therefore, our diplomatic contacts and efforts on this matter continue,” Fidan told a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what role Turkey will play in the force but Israel has made it clear that it will not tolerate the presence of Turkish troops in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Israel was reluctant to agree to a UN mandate for the international force but backed down under US pressure, according to a senior Israeli official. Even so, Israel was involved in drafting the resolution and is still trying to influence its wording, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “At the moment, there aren’t any major issues for us — the question is whether it will stay that way,” the official said. The current working draft does not include any reporting requirement to the Security Council, and Israel wants it to stay that way.\n \n\n   \n  “Some countries will try to increase the Security Council’s involvement as much as possible, and Israel will seek to prevent that,” the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Under the draft resolution, the ISF would operate until the end of 2027, at which point it would require renewal for its mandate in consultation with Israel, Egypt and members of the Security Council.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said that ideally an international force would have begun operating the moment the ceasefire went into effect in early October. The agreement calls for the “immediate” deployment of the force.\n \n\n   \n  “These matters of composition, lack of clarity around the specifics of the disarmament mandate, and the uncertainties around what interaction and coordination will inevitably entail with the (Israel Defense Forces), undoubtedly raise challenges for launching,” Kurtzer-Ellenbogen told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:55:00Z","title":"NASA May Be Quietly Gutting an Iconic Campus with What It Calls Strategic Closures, Workers Fear","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is facing widespread concern over the sudden closure of 13 buildings, including about 100 laboratories and key facilities like the GEMAC chamber, during a federal government shutdown.

quietly gutting an iconic campus with what it calls strategic closures, workers fear \n       \n  By Ella Nilsen, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:55 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alarm is growing among federal workers at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland — the nerve center for groundbreaking missions like the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes — as more than a dozen buildings on the campus are being emptied and padlocked during the federal shutdown, with very little notice to employees, said four sources who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. NASA leadership has pushed back against those concerns.\n \n\n   \n  In one instance, furloughed employees were given just days to temporarily return to work and help empty entire buildings of highly specialized equipment, according to sources and internal emails obtained by CNN. In the communications, NASA managers wrote that equipment not moved in time — including one-of-a-kind hardware — could be thrown away or donated.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a NASA spokesperson said the building closures are part of a “strategic consolidation” plan mapped out by Goddard leaders that should not impact ongoing projects.\n \n\n   \n  But some of the sources CNN spoke with say they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to quietly gut the Maryland Goddard campus while the government remains unfunded — a claim the spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s April budget proposal would have slashed the center’s funding and workforce, including  reducing Goddard’s science staff by 42% . Funding bills passed by congressional lawmakers since then have largely excluded the President’s proposed science cuts.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting rid of Goddard removes the entire nation’s capability to build, develop and analyze data from space science satellites,” one Goddard engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One document reviewed by CNN, which was compiled by more than a dozen Goddard workers concerned about the steps taken at the campus, states that 13 buildings are being shuttered, including about 100 laboratories. The roughly 1,270-acre campus  includes  more than 30 large buildings and dozens of smaller structures.\n \n\n   \n  Uncertainty around the closures has left workers perplexed and concerned that management is moving forward with plans to enact sweeping cuts before Congress passes a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  In their statement, the NASA spokesperson said that the agency is “planning for multiple FY26 scenarios” — including the president’s budget request — “but it is important to note that NASA has and will continue to comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A devastating loss’\n \n\n   \n  The changes described by sources have the space agency’s engineers concerned they could permanently lose access to equipment and facilities that are crucial to keeping current and future projects on track.\n \n\n   \n  The closures could impact  the  2027  launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope, a powerful successor to the Hubble and James Webb telescopes that could revolutionize scientists’ understanding of the cosmos and the beginnings of the universe, two sources told CNN. Roman is a “super Hubble” that can take full sky surveys in space and is meant to study potentially habitable planets and dark matter.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN the closures could also affect NASA’s Dragonfly program, which aims to send a car-size helicopter to study Saturn’s largest moon for signs of habitability and is scheduled to launch in 2028. Both Roman and Dragonfly received continued funding and support even in the President’s budget request.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond those two more imminent projects, sources told CNN the sudden changes at Goddard this month could severely hurt space science and exploration in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Stopping development of what’s in the pipeline now, you’re cutting off the next three decades of missions to explore the universe, to learn more about the planets and to learn more about the Earth,” the Goddard engineer said. “It’s a really devastating loss to think about for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, the NASA spokesperson said that “Dragonfly and Roman will remain operational as their excepted work continues throughout the shutdown,” noting leadership does not expect projects to be delayed by the Goddard Greenbelt campus changes.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Taking a Maserati to the junkyard’\n \n\n   \n  Goddard and NASA leadership had already been working through a master plan —  hashed out years ago  — to revamp the Goddard campus, aiming to cut costs and eventually modernize some of the center’s aging infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  However, several of the buildings currently being emptied are not scheduled to be closed until the early 2030s, according to documents and first-hand accounts from sources. And workers say they haven’t seen signs of new laboratories being constructed or renovated, as is spelled out in the master plan.\n \n\n   \n  The NASA spokesperson said in their statement that “Goddard leadership proposed and was approved to initiate a consolidation of buildings at the Greenbelt and Wallops campuses” earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The new plan was hashed out in response to an exodus of employees who  took deferred resignations . About 841 Goddard employees took such offers this year, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Buildings vacated were approximately 40% unoccupied on average,” the spokesperson’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  One building that has been shuttered, however, houses Goddard’s ElectroMagnetic Anechoic Chamber, or GEMAC, a one-of-a-kind radio-proof room that is essential for testing spacecraft antennas before they are launched.\n \n\n   \n  Components for NASA’s Davinci mission, slated to conduct an unprecedented study of Venus after launch in the early  2030s, were set to be tested in the GEMAC, a source noted.\n \n\n   \n  And closing the facility would have far broader implications, impacting untold numbers of current and future projects because the unique design of the GEMAC allows for the testing of large pieces of communications equipment that would not fit in other, similar facilities, the source noted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like taking a Maserati to the junkyard to get crushed because your driver’s license expired,” another source said. “The GEMAC is fully operational and could go on for many more years to support in-house, out of house, and the industry (like it has for several decades).”\n \n\n   \n  A NASA spokesperson said the GEMAC was in poor condition and would remain closed. The Davinci spacecraft could be tested in alternative facilities, the spokesperson said, and no other projects were slated to move through GEMAC for testing in the next 15 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN, however, that they were concerned GEMAC was the only facility of its kind with an expansive doorway suitable for accommodating large pieces of hardware — and decommissioning the facility would have a long-term impact on NASA’s spacecraft testing capabilities.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sabotage’\n \n\n   \n  Another building that is being emptied on Goddard’s campus includes labs for teams that have been working on the Roman telescope’s propulsion subsystem, one of the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of future missions, once this lab goes away, we won’t be able to do anything like it again,” one Goddard employee said.\n \n\n   \n  That employee questioned whether the cost of moving equipment from one building to another, possibly misplacing or throwing away equipment in the process, was actually saving Goddard and the federal government money.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t understand why our management would want to internally sabotage our capabilities,” the source said. “They haven’t communicated any rationale other than they’re trying to save money, but the things they’re doing don’t actually seem to save money.”\n \n\n   \n  Infrastructure and equipment slated to be given away or disposed of at Goddard cannot be easily replaced, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    Alleged ADA violations\n \n\n   \n  Some of the workers who spoke to CNN also raised concerns that shuttering offices and ordering furloughed workers to return to the office to pack boxes may violate the Antideficiency Act, or ADA.\n \n\n   \n  The ADA is a federal law that impacts how shutdowns should be carried out and stipulates that “employees cannot ‘volunteer’ their services to agencies — i.e., provide services without payment — except in very limited circumstances,” such as being “necessary to protect human life and government property,” according to a government  definition .\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NASA spokesperson said “two exceptions were approved to mainta﻿in our schedule for facility movements throughout the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Those exceptions mostly involved moving technical equipment, not office spaces, the spokesperson said, and “over 100 office space moves have been put on hold until the government reopens.” The statement also denies that any of the building closures or return-to-work directives related to the changes violate federal laws.\n \n\n   \n  Still, employees have also been left wondering why the moves needed to take place when so many employees remained furloughed and unaware of how sensitive hardware was being handled. It’s also unclear whether employees who were asked to help with the moves will ever be compensated for returning to work to move boxes.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this shutdown that is not like every other shutdown,” said Charles Tiefer, a former acting general counsel for the US House of Representatives and a professor emeritus at the University of Baltimore School of Law.

It also highlights the continued push by some leaders in the Trump administration to gouge the bureau of experienced investigators who had worked on past cases tied to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The agents the FBI tried to remove had ties to the probes into Trump’s efforts to  overturn the 2020 presidential election , specifically the investigation known as Arctic Frost, which focused on the fake electors scheme where Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In the past few days, Pirro went directly to FBI leadership after learning these agents were being fired, and told them she had an interest in at least some of the agents continuing to work on an investigation out of her prosecutors’ office. That intervention prompted the bureau to reverse the firings, three sources told CNN this week.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel has suggested to Republicans in Congress that he plans to remove anyone involved in the Arctic Frost probe.\n \n\n   \n  At least two other agents removed in the last week were tied to the Arctic Frost probe and their firings were not reversed.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Pirro did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused former special counsel Jack Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain  phone records  of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement issued Tuesday, the FBI Agents Association, a membership-based advocacy organization that represents current and retired agents, condemned FBI leadership for wanting to fire the agents who had been associated with the Arctic Frost investigation, and abandoning due process in making personnel decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “The actions yesterday — in which FBI Special Agents were terminated and then reinstated shortly after, and then only to be fired again today — highlight the chaos that occurs when long-standing policies and processes are ignored,” the association said. “An Agent simply being assigned to an investigation and conducting it appropriately within the law should never be grounds for termination.

\nUpdated: \n        3:06 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People looking to lose weight and lower their blood sugar may someday be able to get a single injection that turns their cells into tiny factories churning out a protein that is essentially the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the ambition of two biotech startups, New York-based RenBio and Fractyl Health in Massachusetts. Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.\n \n\n   \n  With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.\n \n\n   \n  Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.\n \n\n   \n  In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to  a recent Gallup report . Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.\n \n\n   \n  But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A  recent study  found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.\n \n\n   \n  The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl is presenting  the latest results  from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a  preprint paper , meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.\n \n\n   \n    Turning muscle cells into GLP-1 factories\n \n\n   \n  RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.\n \n\n   \n  DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.\n \n\n   \n  “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.\n \n\n   \n  Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.\n \n\n   \n  “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.\n \n\n   \n  In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.\n \n\n   \n    Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1\n \n\n   \n  Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which  can lead to cancer .\n \n\n   \n  The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.\n \n\n   \n  “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.\n \n\n   \n  “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.\n \n\n   \n  “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in Europe to start human trials.\n \n\n   \n  “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.\n \n\n   \n  By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.\n \n\n   \n  That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.\n \n\n   \n  It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.\n \n\n   \n  In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.\n \n\n   \n  Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.\n \n\n   \n  When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight.

Bush, dies \n       \n  By Stephen Collinson, Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:07 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dick Cheney, America’s most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.\n \n\n   \n  “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n \n\n   \n  The 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player.\n \n\n   \n  Bush described Cheney in a statement Tuesday as a “decent, honorable man.” “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position,” Bush said.\n \n\n   \n  In his final years, Cheney, still a hardline conservative, nevertheless became largely ostracized from his party over his intense  criticism of President Donald Trump  whom he branded a “coward”   and the greatest-ever threat to the republic.\n \n\n   \n  In an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president’s club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a  heart transplant in 2012  that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  While caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush’s inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was in the White House, with the president out of town on the crisp, clear morning of September 11, 2001. In the split second of horror when a second hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center in New York, he said he became a changed man, determined to avenge the al Qaeda-orchestrated attacks and to enforce US power throughout the Middle East with a neo-conservative doctrine of regime change and pre-emptive war.\n \n\n   \n  “At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN’s John King in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.\n \n\n   \n  Contemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “ The Decider .”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple former presidents paid tribute to Cheney on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton and Joe Biden highlighting the former vice president’s “public service.”\n \n\n   \n    A changed man\n \n\n   \n  From a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.\n \n\n   \n  The September 11 attacks unleashed the US war in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, which was harboring al Qaeda, though the terror group’s leader Osama bin Laden escaped. Soon, Cheney was agitating for widening the US assault to Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, whose forces he had helped to eject from Kuwait in the first Gulf War as President George H.W. Bush’s Pentagon chief.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s aggressive warnings about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney’s most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”\n \n\n   \n  The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable.   Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.\n \n\n   \n    No regrets\n \n\n   \n  Cheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  To the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 3,000 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.\n \n\n   \n  “I would do it again in a minute,”  Cheney said , when confronted by a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 that  concluded  enhanced interrogation methods as brutal and ineffective and responsible for damaging US standing in the eyes of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Of the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘He’s a coward’\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president’s first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.\n \n\n   \n  The former vice president’s daughter, then-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, sacrificed a promising career in the GOP to oppose Trump after his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. In an  ad for his daughter’s unsuccessful campaign  to fight off a pro-Trump candidate’s primary challenge in 2022, Dick Cheney – who was, by then, rarely seen in public – looked directly into the camera from under a wide brimmed cowboy hat and delivered an extraordinary direct message.\n \n\n   \n  “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\n \n\n   \n    Early days out West\n \n\n   \n  Richard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was  accepted  to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission,  he was kicked out .\n \n\n   \n  He returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn’t interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told  The New Yorker . “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney went back to school and earned a bachelor’s and master’s in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n    A veteran Washington power broker\n \n\n   \n  Cheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  He was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon.\n \n\n   \n  The pair formed an extraordinary backroom alliance in the Bush administration throughout the war on terror and the Iraq war – much to the frustration of more moderate members of the administration including then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice – who took over from Powell in the second term.\n \n\n   \n  While Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming’s sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a  very conservative voting record .\n \n\n   \n  In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq’s troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.\n \n\n   \n  During Clinton’s presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.\n \n\n   \n  It wouldn’t be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate’s search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.\n \n\n   \n  “During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bush’s presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration’s energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush’s first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  He was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary’s sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to  The Washington Post . “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.\n \n\n   \n  His relationship with Bush was complicated in later years, including by Bush’s refusal to pardon Cheney’s chief of staff Scooter Libby, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 after a probe into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative. Libby was eventually pardoned by Trump in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally  shot a hunting partner  in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.\n \n\n   \n    Health issues\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney at the time said that he’d be the “the first to step down” if he learned he’d be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated. Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama’s inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.\n \n\n   \n  A year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.\n \n\n   \n    Life after the White House\n \n\n   \n  After leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.\n \n\n   \n  Years later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership’s response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheney   on the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  In a remarkable moment,  Democrats lined up  to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  hugged Cheney . The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.\n \n\n   \n  It was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to  endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat and Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign. He said he would vote for Harris because of the “duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.” Cheney emphasized his disdain for Trump at the time and warned that he “can never be trusted with power again,” though Trump would go on to win the presidency a couple of months later.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jamie Gangel and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:09:00-05:00","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old man from Peterborough, Anthony Williams, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and possession of a bladed article following a mass stabbing on a high-speed LNER train between Doncaster and London, which occurred just after leaving Peterborough station.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, Catherine Nicholls, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over a  mass stabbing attack  on a British train on Saturday evening that targeted passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London.\n \n\n   \n  The attack left eleven people hospitalized with injuries, one of whom is still fighting for his life in the hospital after confronting the attacker, according British Transport Police (BTP).\n \n\n   \n  The man charged, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday. While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  He is further charged with one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article in connection to the mass stabbing in Cambridgeshire, according to BTP.\n \n\n   \n  The man is also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with a separate incident that happened earlier on Saturday at Pontoon Dock Station in London.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday evening, four people remain in hospital, one of whom is in critical but stable condition, BTP said. The critically injured man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” police said earlier.\n \n\n   \n  LNER named him as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for the train company for more than two decades as a customer experience host.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” BTP said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood paid tribute to the worker, saying that he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  Zitouni’s family said in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims who was hospitalized is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/fbi-investigation-michigan-terrorist-plot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00-05:00","title":"How phone calls, sessions at gun ranges and secret meetings in parks led the FBI to charge suspects in alleged terrorist plot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A coordinated FBI investigation uncovered a suspected ISIS-linked terrorist plot in Michigan, where Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud were arrested after months of surveillance.

      \nUpdated: \n        12:49 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a  terrorist attack  in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.\n \n\n   \n  But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.\n \n\n   \n  Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about how the investigation unfolded:\n \n\n   \n    A cryptic reference to Paris prompts suspicion\n \n\n   \n  According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.\n \n\n   \n  In June, agents allegedly tracked the man’s phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali’s home there, where he stayed for two nights.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.\n \n\n   \n  During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  A review of co-conspirator 1’s cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1’s phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari’ and ALI’s phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.’”\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.’”\n \n\n   \n  “Knowing Athari, it’s (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in  November 2015 . More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.\n \n\n   \n  After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n    Talk turned to action with purchase of firearms, complaint alleges\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.\n \n\n   \n  On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.\n \n\n   \n    FBI tailed trio as they allegedly scouted locations\n \n\n   \n  Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.\n \n\n   \n  “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.\n \n\n   \n  Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”\n \n\n   \n    References to ‘pumpkin’ trigger arrest on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n  In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”\n \n\n   \n  “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents  speculated  whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city’s large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Court process begins with hearing\n \n\n   \n  Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holly Yan, Jeff Winter and Leigh Waldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/michigan-terror-plot-arrests-key-questions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00.000-05:00","title":"5 Key Questions About How Arrests in Michigan Terror Plot Went Down","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"FBI Director Kash Patel publicly announced the arrest of two young men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, in Michigan, following a suspected ISIS-inspired Halloween attack plot.

Lopez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:37 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At 7:32 a.m. on Friday,  FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X  that his agency “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan.”\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about a cryptic reference to “pumpkin day,” online chats about an ISIS-inspired attack, and activity at a shooting range.\n \n\n   \n  The more details Patel promised ultimately arrived Monday in the form of a 73-page criminal complaint accusing Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud of  plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US .\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details. CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n  CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller on Monday addressed five key questions related to the case.\n \n\n   \n   How atypical was the process here? The FBI director announces arrests on X, and three days later the details are released in the form of a criminal complaint. \n \n\n   \n  It’s not typical to announce a case before charges are filed. But there were a number of considerations here. When it seemed like the alleged attack was becoming   imminent, the FBI decided to move in on the suspects early. The social media post from the FBI director was likely his way of being transparent in a case where multiple high-profile FBI raids in a tight-knit community were definitely going to   leak out. He has said before he is the most transparent FBI director in the agency’s   history. His forward lean on these things is deliberate.\n \n\n   \n   What kind of complications can arise going forward when the FBI director goes public with the case so early? \n \n\n   \n  Just the kind we saw. The early announcement left the public with more questions than answers and allowed for a lot of speculation. They may have tried to compensate for that by the enormous amount of detail that they included in the 73-page public document released Monday  charging two men in the alleged plot. \n \n\n   \n   What did we learn from the criminal complaint that makes a case for prosecutors? \n \n\n   \n  We learned, according to the FBI, just how close we may have come to a horrific terrorist attack. The complaint tells us that these individuals have been using encrypted apps and chat groups to communicate for months. Talking about potential attacks, martyring themselves for ISIS. What the date of the attack should be, looking at potential targets. According to the complaint, the youngest member of the group, a 16-year-old boy, was the one who was pushing the hardest not to wait any longer, to do the attack on Halloween. We also learned from the complaint that they purchased multiple AR-15 rifles and a shotgun and equipped them with laser-pointed sights and flashlights to be able to pick out targets in the dark. They went to target practice in groups multiple times, according to the complaint. The lead agent in the FBI investigation believes that two trips they made just days before the arrest to look at a strip of nightclubs and bars were likely a reconnaissance mission, the complaint alleges, and the agent believed the targets under consideration were LGBTQ+ nightclubs.\n \n\n   \n   What did we not learn from the complaint that may be beneficial to the defense? \n \n\n   \n  We did not learn full details about the role of a “confidential human source” referred to in the complaint. This was likely an FBI informant, but there were also references to an FBI “undercover employee” who may have also been an agent. For the FBI, having two people on the inside providing information would give them a real advantage. From the defense standpoint, there is always the “agent provocateur” defense, that people not predisposed to this may have been entrapped into the plot. Well, that defense has been raised in many, many cases since 9/11. It has done much better on the courthouse steps in the lawyer’s press conferences than it has fared in court in front of a jury.\n \n\n   \n   What are next steps for investigators? \n \n\n   \n  There are two people charged in the federal complaint, and both are adults. So one question is, where is the 16-year-old who was such a high-profile driver of this   alleged plot? Is he cooperating? Is he charged in a separate document that is sealed because of his age? Or is he facing state charges in Michigan that may be coming later? Beyond that, the complaint describes other people involved in the conspiracy who have also not been charged. I think we can expect more arrests. This didn’t come together the way these things usually do. The FBI had to move quickly at the end of last week to prevent what they believed was then an imminent plot. So they will go over the evidence they gathered in the search warrants, what they find in the computers and on the phones, and what they learned by questioning these suspects after they were arrested in the early morning hours of Halloween. There’s definitely more to come.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/big-questions-election-day-2025","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:37:00-05:00","title":"5 Big Questions About Election Day 2025","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Election Day 2025, Americans voted in key races including New Jersey and Virginia governorships, the New York City mayoral race, a redistricting ballot in California, and state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania.

But the plots and subplots are still important. And there will be plenty to learn from the results.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the  most significant contests  of Election Day 2025: races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, the New York City mayor’s race, a much-watched redistricting ballot measure in California, and key state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  Below are some of my big questions today.\n \n\n   \n    1. Can Democrats show real momentum?\n \n\n   \n  The 2026 midterm elections pose a conundrum.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, President Donald Trump and many of his actions are quite unpopular. (A CNN poll this week showed his disapproval rating  hitting an all-time numerical high of 63% , in fact.) And presidents in that position usually lose big in midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, the Democratic brand is in the tank. And that’s called into question whether the party would be able to take full advantage of Trump’s problems. Its lead on the so-called generic ballot, for instance,  hasn’t been that convincing .\n \n\n   \n  The verdict this year has been strong for Democrats. They’ve  routinely overperformed by wide margins  in special elections and other races. But Tuesday’s elections should provide the best clues to date.\n \n\n   \n  The big question is whether Democrats continue to benefit from the kind of turnout advantage they’ve seen in those special elections, now that we’re getting into higher-turnout races.\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll this week provided some encouraging signs for Democrats on that front.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, 67% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said they were “extremely” motivated to vote in the midterms, compared with just 46% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the gap between voters who said they intended to vote to support the president (21%) and to oppose him (41%) was bigger than at any point since 2006. George W. Bush and the GOP got drubbed in those midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats definitely want to win the New Jersey and Virginia governor’s races. But that’s more of a baseline than anything.\n \n\n   \n  What they’d really love to see is their side turning out in huge numbers to send a message — and Republicans continuing to suffer the turnout problems they usually do when Trump isn’t on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n    2. Can Mamdani get close to 50?\n \n\n   \n  It would be a shock if the New York City mayor’s race resulted in anything other than a win for state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. He’s led by double digits in most polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the forces trying to stop the 34-year-old democratic socialist are still throwing everything at the wall.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, they’ve tossed a Hail Mary if there ever was one: Trump effectively endorsing his former nemesis, ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Cuomo actually leaning in on it. Trump on Monday night  urged supporters to back Cuomo  over Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani critics have been suggesting Sliwa drop out of the race for a long time, arguing he’s splitting the anti-Mamdani vote.\n \n\n   \n  The 50% mark is something of an artificial guidepost — even if Mamdani gets in the high 40s, it suggests Cuomo never really had a chance.  Polling  shows not all Sliwa supporters would have reverted to Cuomo in a two-man race.\n \n\n   \n    3. Do voters send a message about violent rhetoric?\n \n\n   \n  Even if it’s a good night for Democrats, that could come with a major and potentially significant exception: the Virginia attorney general’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Most polls there show a competitive race between Republican incumbent Jason Miyares and Democratic former state Delegate Jay Jones. And the reason is clear: Jones’ recently unearthed  violent text messages , in which he suggested a political opponent’s children should die.\n \n\n   \n  The polls signal there could be a sizeable gap between this race and the top of the ticket. A recent  Washington Post-Schar School poll  showed Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger leading the governor’s race by 12 points, but Jones in a tie with Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  If that gap shows up in the results — and especially if Jones loses — it would send a strong message about voters’ tolerance for violent rhetoric in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and a number of other high-profile examples of political violence.\n \n\n   \n    4. Are there any shutdown impacts?\n \n\n   \n  The federal government shutdown is poised to become the longest in history on Wednesday, when it is set to enter its 36th day.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s been a relatively minor subplot in these races. And that includes in Virginia, which is home to many federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, we shouldn’t necessarily expect any major clues about how the shutdown is playing, politically.\n \n\n   \n  But the results  could still impact the shutdown moving forward .\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats underperform, for instance, they might start to fear they are overplaying their hands politically. And if they win big, they might feel emboldened to keep pushing the envelope and holding out for an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies they’ve been demanding.\n \n\n   \n  Polling shows Americans are more likely to blame the shutdown on Republicans than on Democrats, which has instilled Democrats with confidence in their strategy. Tuesday will test whether they feel like pressing forward.\n \n\n   \n    5. How do Newsom and Shapiro emerge?\n \n\n   \n  California’s Proposition 50 and the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court retention elections won’t get the attention of the more preeminent contests.\n \n\n   \n  But they’re worth watching for a number of reasons. And a big one is how they reflect on a pair of ambitious Democratic governors who are thought to be 2028 presidential contenders.\n \n\n   \n  In California, Proposition 50 is looking like a significant triumph for Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Basically, Newsom launched the ballot initiative in response to Texas Republicans’ politically brazen effort to draw five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. Newsom wanted to offset that with new districts that favor Democrats in California.\n \n\n   \n  But he needed voters’ consent to do it. And that looked  potentially dicey , given he was effectively asking for permission to gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  It looks like the bet paid off, given Republicans seem to have thrown in the towel on trying to defeat the measure. The situation also helped put Newsom center stage nationally in the process. If Prop 50 can rack up a huge margin of victory, all the better for him.\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, Shapiro has  invested significant political capital  in trying to get voters to grant new 10-year terms to a trio of Democratic state Supreme Court justices. Such “retention” votes almost always succeed, but Republicans have fought hard to defeat the justices.  Trump even weighed in  this week.\n \n\n   \n  There’s probably more downside than anything in this for Shapiro, given how unusual it would be for justices to lose the retention votes. But again, the margins are worth watching.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/food/dennys-private-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:18:00-05:00","title":"Denny’s Is Being Taken Private, Pizza Hut May Be for Sale","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Denny’s, a long-standing diner chain, has agreed to be taken private by TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Yadav Enterprises in a $322 million deal, ending its public trading on Nasdaq.

Chang’s, and Yadav Enterprises, a major Denny’s franchisee, in a $322 million deal (excluding its substantial debt load).\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s board approved the deal. If accepted by shareholders, Denny’s stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq, ending a nearly six-decade run on the public stock market.\n \n\n   \n  Shares jumped 50% in early trading Tuesday. Prior to Tuesday, the stock had lost about a third of its value this year.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s had reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, but decided that this transaction “maximizes value and has determined it is fair to and in the best interests of stockholders and represents the best path forward for the company,” CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s recent  struggles began during the pandemic . One of its main selling points was being open 24/7. However, that requirement temporarily ended during the height of pandemic. Since 2021, about a quarter of its roughly 1,600 restaurants have not returned to those around-the-clock hours, so Denny’s eased up on the requirement for a franchise to do so.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also facing competition for cash-strapped customers from rapidly growing chains like First Watch,  fast food competitors  or people opting to eat at home in a bid to save money.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s also  announced 180 closures  over the last two years, with the chain attempting a turnaround plan that involves remodels and new menu items to jumpstart traffic.\n \n\n   \n  Sales at locations open at least a year declined 2.9% in the most recent quarter and it only completed 10 remodels, Denny’s also  reported  late Monday.\n \n\n   \n    Pizza Hut for sale?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Yum! Brands announced it launched a “formal review of strategic options” for Pizza Hut, including a possible sale for the chain that was once owned by PepsiCo.\n \n\n   \n  “The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum!

sharks to eat their livers in drone footage recorded in Mexico \n       \n  By Jack Guy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:57 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Scientists working in Mexico have recorded multiple incidents in which a group of orcas hunt young great white sharks and eat their energy-rich livers.\n \n\n   \n  While orca pods in  South Africa ,  Australia  and California have been recorded engaging in similar behavior, this is the first time that it has been documented in Mexico, according to a study published in the journal  Frontiers in Marine Science  on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  In one incident, recorded in August 2020 using various cameras as well as a drone that captured aerial footage, a group of five female killer whales were recorded working together to attack a young white shark and remove its liver, before sharing it between them.\n \n\n   \n  A few minutes later, the group attacks another young white shark, successfully removing the liver.\n \n\n   \n  Another recording dates to August 2022, when a mixed group of orcas were recorded attacking a young white shark in the same location, then eating the liver.\n \n\n   \n  The study noted that in two of the three recorded predation events the orcas immobilized the shark by flipping it onto its back and deftly avoided bites that could thwart the attack.\n \n\n   \n  By turning the shark over they may induce “tonic immobility,” which makes the shark easier to manipulate, it added.\n \n\n   \n  “Prey handling and inducing tonic immobility may be more easily achieved in smaller white sharks compared with larger individuals, thereby also reducing risk of bite injury,” the study said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our evidence undoubtedly shows consistency in the repeated assaults and strikes, indicating efficient maneuvering ability by the killer whales in attempting to turn the shark upside down, likely to induce tonic immobility and allow uninterrupted access to the organs for consumption,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Study author Erick Higuera, a wildlife cinematographer and marine biologist at Conexiones Terramar, a nonprofit organization, told CNN that he was surprised that the orcas hunted white sharks in the same area in different years.\n \n\n   \n  This may suggest that juvenile white sharks are becoming a regular seasonal prey target for orcas, which could “represent a significant additional pressure” on white shark populations, according to the paper.\n \n\n   \n  “This provides more information on the ecology of orcas in the Gulf of California, which can be used for the conservation and preservation of both white sharks and orcas,” said Higuera.\n \n\n   \n  Alison Towner, a marine biologist from Rhodes University, South Africa, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the evidence presented by the study was “strong.”\n \n\n   \n  “Drone footage is invaluable here – we first captured and published drone footage of orcas killing white sharks in South Africa, and it changed what we understood about these interactions,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “This new footage from Mexico lets us compare behaviour across different orca groups and shark populations.”\n \n\n   \n  Towner highlighted that, while the behavior has been shown not to be an isolated occurrence, it is not widespread across all orca populations.\n \n\n   \n  “It appears to be specific to certain orca groups that have learned this technique, and the impact depends on how frequently the behaviour occurs in a given region,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Once the technique exists in a group, it becomes part of their hunting culture,” said Towner, who underlined the targeting of the shark livers, which are rich in nutrients and large relative to the animal’s size.\n \n\n   \n  “For orcas that know how to safely handle a shark, the nutritional reward is very high.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

  \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  The world has failed to meet its main climate change target of limiting the rise in global temperatures  to 1.5 degrees Celsius , and will likely breach this threshold in the next decade, the United Nations’ Environment Programme said on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The annual Emissions Gap report said because of countries’ slow action to reduce planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions, it was now clear that the world would exceed the core target of the 2015 Paris Agreement — at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be difficult to reverse – requiring faster and bigger additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to minimize overshoot,” UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  Lead report author Anne Olhoff said deep emissions cuts now could delay when the overshoot happens, “but we can no longer totally avoid it.”\n \n\n   \n  The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Yet governments’ latest pledges to cut emissions in future, if met, would see the world face 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming, UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s around 0.3 degrees Celsius less warming than the UN’s projection a year ago — indicating that new climate pollution-cutting plans announced this year by countries including top CO2 emitter China have failed to substantially close the gap.\n \n\n   \n  China pledged in September to cut emissions by 7-10% from their peak by 2035.  Analysts  note the country tends to set modest targets and exceed them.\n \n\n   \n  The findings add pressure to the UN’s COP30 climate summit this month, where countries will debate how to kick-start and finance faster action to rein in global warming.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris Agreement temperature goals were based on scientific assessments of how each increment of global warming fuels worse heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. For example, 2 degrees of warming would more than double the share of the population exposed to extreme heat, compared with 1.5 degrees . Warming of 1.5 degrees would destroy at least 70% of coral reefs, versus 99% at 2 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Current policies — the ones countries already have in place — would lead to even more warming, of around 2.8 degrees, UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  The world has made some progress. A decade ago, when the Paris Agreement was signed, the planet was on course for around a 4 degree temperature rise.\n \n\n   \n  But heat-trapping carbon emissions continue to rise, as countries burn coal, oil and gas to power their economies.\n \n\n   \n  Global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 2.3% in 2024, UNEP said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-04:00","title":"Suspects Charged in Alleged Terror Plot Cited ISIS and May Have Tried to Replicate Paris Terror Attack on US Soil, FBI Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two young men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, face federal terrorism charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired attack in the U.S. on Halloween, potentially modeled on the 2015 Paris attacks.

terror attack on US soil, FBI says \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, Leigh Waldman, Jeff Winter, Holly Yan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:47 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two men face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US – possibly on the scale of the  2015 Paris terror attacks  that killed at least 130 people, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI raid on Halloween morning stunned neighbors in Dearborn, the  second-safest city in Michigan  and home to the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to a criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “Our newly unsealed complaint reveals a major ISIS-linked terror plot,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi  posted on X .\n \n\n   \n  “According to the complaint, subjects had multiple AR-15 rifles, tactical gear, and a detailed plan to carry out an attack on American soil,” she said, thanking officials for averting an attack “before innocent lives were lost.”\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n    Suspects bought AR-15-style rifles and over 1,600 rounds of ammo, agent says \n \n\n   \n  Ali and an unidentified juvenile were “planning to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the designated foreign terrorist organization ISIS,” an FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint, citing communications on an encrypted app.\n \n\n   \n  Further investigation revealed Mahmoud and others were co-conspirators in the plot, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n  Ali purchased a shotgun, an AR-15-style rifle and multiple accessories, including “a forced reset trigger that allows a shooter to increase the rate of fire in a semiautomatic weapon,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also bought an AR-15-style rifle and more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used in AR-15 style rifles he and Ali had purchased, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n    A suspect mentions doing the ‘same thing as France’ on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In addition to meeting in person, Ali, Mahmoud, the juvenile and co-conspirators chatted online, sharing “extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks similar to what they planned,” the FBI agent wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Ali and the juvenile “discussed when to conduct their attack, which they appeared to set for Halloween,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The pair allegedly said they were going to do the “same thing as France,” the complaint says. And a conversation with a co-conspirator included mention of someone potentially going “to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  The agent took this to be a reference to the multifaceted terror rampage in France, which  killed at least 130 people in 2015 . ISIS claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n \n\n   \n  ISIS also claimed responsibility for a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was popular with the LGBTQ community,  killed 49 people .\n \n\n   \n  Ali, Mahmoud and the juvenile traveled to clubs in Ferndale, Michigan, the FBI complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  “All three of these clubs are located on Woodward Avenue near East Nine Mile,” the agent wrote. “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of the neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents Ali, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN before the criminal complaint was released.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who said he is representing another suspect arrested in the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin” day reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN prior to the release of the criminal complaint. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/major-general-tomer-yerushalmi-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:28:00.000-05:00","title":"A leaked video, a frantic search, and the top military lawyer: What to know about the scandal rocking Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked video showing alleged sexual abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman military prison in July 2024 triggered a national scandal in Israel.

By Tal Shalev, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:28 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a week ago, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the  Israeli  military’s top lawyer, tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the nation’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a  notorious Israeli military prison .\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding target of Israel’s right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi’s rapid fall has quickly emerged as a national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The affair dates back to July 2024, when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation and subsequent arrest of the soldiers fueled an intense political backlash, with some right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition even joining protests and riots outside the Sde Teiman facility and the military court where the soldiers were taken.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024, but it wasn’t the first report to raise concerns about conditions at the base. In May 2024, CNN spoke to  three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse  at Sde Teiman. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.\n \n\n   \n  But that did little to dull the vitriol targeting the military’s top lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Tomer-Yerushalmi was suspended from her role as military advocate-general, as Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav‑Miara announced a criminal investigation into the leak. Two days later, Tomer-Yerushalmi submitted her resignation letter, acknowledging that she approved the release of the video and taking “full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from within the unit.”\n \n\n   \n  She wrote in her letter that an “incitement campaign” against her had reached its peak following the decision to investigate soldiers at Sde Teiman. “This campaign continues to this very day and causes deep and serious harm to the IDF, to its image, and to the resilience of IDF soldiers and their commanders,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “There are things that cannot be done even against the worst of the detainees,” she wrote. “Officers of the (legal) unit have faced repeated personal attacks, harsh insults, and even real threats. All of this because they stood guard over the rule of law in the IDF – together with the commanders and alongside them.”\n \n\n   \n  For Israel’s right-wing political echelon, the resignation and investigation weren’t enough. Hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi stepped down, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he would take “all necessary sanctions against her,” including stripping her of her rank. Katz, who issued no fewer than seven statements against the chief military attorney in less than a week, accused her of involvement in a “blood libel” against the soldiers, even though the veracity of the video has not been questioned, and five soldiers were indicted in February 2025 for the abuse of the detainee. They have denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Worst PR disaster’ for Israel\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu called the leak “an enormous reputational blow,” describing it on Sunday as “the worst PR disaster in Israel’s history.”\n \n\n   \n  National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir dubbed the lawyer’s conduct “criminal behavior under a legal guise” and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the leak.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Tomer-Yerushalmi went missing.\n \n\n   \n  For several hours on Sunday, the Israeli military and police were unable to locate the woman who had, until just days earlier, been the top lawyer for the country’s armed forces. The IDF said in a statement that it would “employ all means available” to locate her “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  After an extensive search, she was found on a beach north of Tel Aviv.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday evening, police arrested Tomer-Yerushalmi on suspicion of multiple offenses: fraud and breach of trust, abuse of official power, obstruction of justice, and disclosure of information by a public official.\n \n\n   \n  She has not been formally charged yet or entered a plea. Her next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. A lawyer representing Tomer-Yerushalmi declined to comment on the case.\n \n\n   \n  Tomer-Yerushalmi is also suspected of allegedly misleading the High Court of Justice, and senior military and justice officials, about the leak of the footage and even submitting a false affidavit to the court. Alongside Tomer-Yerushalmi, other senior legal officials in the military prosecutor’s office are also implicated in the leak and its alleged cover-up. According to the police, there are five suspects in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Palestinian detainee at the center of the alleged abuse has been returned to Gaza as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, raising questions about the prospects of an effective prosecution of the soldiers accused in the case since the alleged victim is not available to testify.\n \n\n   \n  The affair has become a part of a larger attack on Israel’s judiciary from Netanyahu’s coalition.   Justice Minister Yariv Levin is attempting to bar Baharav-Miara – also a  frequent target  of the right wing – from probing the leak, suggesting the attorney general’s own involvement in the case should also be examined. “Anyone involved in conflicts of interest will not be part of the investigation,” Levin insisted in a statement last week.\n \n\n   \n  “The lies that have been built here over the years, while trampling on the rights of entire populations and severely harming the security of the state and IDF soldiers, are gradually falling apart,” said Levin. “One group that has gotten used to treating the country as its own is being replaced.”\n \n\n   \n  Baharav-Miara’s office responded in a letter, saying Levin was trying to “unlawfully interfere” with the investigative process, which “impedes its progress.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/uk/david-beckham-knighted-king-charles-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:24:00-05:00","title":"David Beckham Knighted by King Charles at Windsor Castle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Beckham has been knighted by King Charles III at a ceremony held at Windsor Castle, marking a significant personal and public milestone.

summit without even being there \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration does not intend to send a high-level delegation to the  COP30 climate summit  — or possibly any delegation at all. But that doesn’t mean the country’s influence won’t be felt at the talks.\n \n\n   \n  As nations prepare to gather in Belém, Brazil, for the negotiations, which begin on Thursday with the leaders summit, the US is set to play the part of the elephant in the room. Even operating from afar, the US could have the power to blow up a deal in Belém. The Trump administration has recently taken aggressive stances to try to influence other countries’ climate policies, mainly by threatening hostile trade measures.\n \n\n   \n  The US   has estranged itself   from official international climate negotiation processes while simultaneously exerting pressure on trading partners to water down or reject climate commitments. This paradox could have an impact on COP30, experts tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It is not known whether the US will simply ignore COP or try to intervene to secure preferred outcomes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has publicly criticized the COP process and stated it does not plan to participate. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The US will not send any high-level representatives to COP30, Rogers said. “The President is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  This practice of linking trade and climate so closely is an innovation of the Trump administration, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University who worked on US climate negotiations with China for the Obama administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of US leadership, she said that China, which is the world’s top emitter, may seek to assume more of a prominent, steering role at the talks. The European Union is also likely to take a strong role, though internal rifts have emerged within the EU regarding how aggressively to cut its own emissions.\n \n\n   \n    Weakening resolve\n \n\n   \n  Other countries have not followed the US out of the Paris Agreement, but the abrupt shifts in policy in Washington have affected the global mood. An administration that now heavily favors fossil fuels over renewables has reduced the incentives for other countries to submit ambitious plans for cutting emissions through 2035, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  These plans were supposed to be delivered by virtually every country in the world in the run up to COP30. However, only about 60 countries delivered theirs to the UN on time, and the actions they outline fall far short of achieving the temperature targets contained in the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s an undeniable fact, which is that with the US withdrawal for a second time, it’s definitely seeming to undermine ambition,” Gallagher said. “I think it’s just getting harder to make the case that global ambition is going to rise without pretty substantial engagement from the United States,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And now, instead of constructive engagement or simply disengagement, America has demonstrated a trend toward behavior that undermines aggressive climate goals. This was the case last month at a  meeting of the International Maritime Organization  (IMO), which regulates pollution from the international shipping fleet, where US diplomats acted in concert with major oil-producing nations to scuttle what would have been the world’s first carbon tax.\n \n\n   \n  The long-heralded proposal would have imposed a tax on carbon pollution from global shipping to encourage a switch to cleaner-burning fuels. Officials in Washington — including President Donald Trump who  released a scathing Truth Social post  — were involved in turning up the pressure on diplomats at that meeting. The US threatened to retaliate via trade measures against countries who voted in favor. Neither Gallagher nor other experts expect similarly disruptive behavior from the US during COP30, but they couldn’t rule it out, either.\n \n\n   \n  However, Kaveh Guilanpour of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, for one, thinks any US intervention would be less effective at COP30 than it was at the shipping meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “The rest of the world continues to be committed to the Paris Agreement. Countries realize that it is ultimately in their long-term interest that the Paris Agreement succeeds,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation [with the global carbon tax] is very different from that of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “There was a very specific normative proposal under the IMO that the US pushed back against. Negotiations under the Paris Agreement, on the other hand, are largely over. It is now about implementing promises already made.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite those differences, the IMO episode is an example of the US prioritizing its own trade interests over global interests to cut planet-warming pollution. Gallagher said it’s possible that the Trump administration will again seek to disrupt negotiations, from the sidelines of COP30. Only this time, the point of contention would likely be climate finance :  Funding climate adaptation and renewable energy in the developing world is a big topic at COP30.\n \n\n   \n  America’s options for swaying the negotiations themselves, however, are ironically limited, she said, because of the Paris withdrawal and lack of attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s very little that the Trump administration could do in Brazil,” Gallagher said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/africa/sudan-un-secretary-general-guterres-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:36:00-05:00","title":"UN Secretary-General Warns That War in Sudan Is 'Spiraling Out of Control'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, warned in November 2025 that the war in Sudan is spiraling out of control after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city of El Fasher in the Darfur region.

It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:19 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “We have no inflation,” President Donald Trump said in his  “60 Minutes” interview  Sunday evening. “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n  And with  those two false claims , Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  Whether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.\n \n\n   \n  Inflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Grocery prices aren’t down, either – they’re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Denying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.\n \n\n   \n  A new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.\n \n\n   \n  Biden  polled miserably on the economy , too.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,” Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”  a claim that CNN later deemed false .\n \n\n   \n  Biden conceded that inflation is “the bane of our existence,” but downplayed it by saying it’s “mostly in food, and in gasoline.”\n \n\n   \n  That dismissiveness probably hurt the Democrats in last year’s election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising – just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren’t exactly swayed by the Biden administration’s frequent statements that the  economy was on fire .\n \n\n   \n  “Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world and trending lower,” Biden  said  during his 2024 State of the Union address. “It takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters didn’t buy it. Biden’s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tactics aren’t exactly  Biden’s . In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting “ greedflation ” and “shrinkflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is just straight-up doling out untruths – and  blaming Biden .\n \n\n   \n  But either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don’t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters’ lived experiences – especially when they’re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.\n \n\n   \n    Acknowledging reality\n \n\n   \n  Interestingly, Trump identified Biden’s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.\n \n\n   \n  The consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problems  quickly became Trump’s . But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN’s poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans aren’t just kvetching about high prices; they’re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they’re changing their behavior.  Chipotle, Coke, Crocs  and other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.\n \n\n   \n  Despite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans’ frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.  Loan defaults  and delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America’s most vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n    Inflation’s snowball effect\n \n\n   \n  The problem with inflation is that it’s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes – even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.\n \n\n   \n  Zooming out further, Moody’s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne﻿ed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don’t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are not interested in that story,” Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. “Their prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are, and that is why a large part of the public, if you sample people, inflation is still very much making people unhappy.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell noted it will take time – and growing paychecks – for the effect of higher prices to wear off.\n \n\n   \n  “It will feel better over time, but that will take time,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the lesson for Trump may have been best stated by Democratic political strategist David Plouffe.\n \n\n   \n  In “Original Sin,” the book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson into Biden’s late-term cognitive decline, Plouffe said the fatal mistake by Democrats  was to deny the reality voters were witnessing.\n \n\n   \n  “Never again can we as a party suggest to people that what they’re seeing is not true,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/baseball-salary-cap-2027","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"After Dodgers’ win, a salary cap is looming large over baseball.

Here’s why that might be a bad idea \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It may be easy to look at the Los Angeles Dodgers’ record-setting payroll and back-to-back World Series titles and think that baseball desperately   needs a salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  After all, the Dodgers’ total payroll of $350 million is roughly double the league’s average and $84 million more than the previous record for a series champ, which was set by the Dodgers themselves just one year earlier.   \n \n\n   \n  And there are indications team owners will be pushing for a cap in labor negotiations a year from now when the labor deal between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the labor union representing nearly 8,000 players in the majors and minors.\n \n\n   \n  “No one argues that the Kansas City Chiefs are ruining football by dominating the sport because the Chiefs didn’t buy their way to a championship, and it’s perceived that the Dodgers did,” said Victor Matheson, economics professor and expert in the business of sports at the College of the Holy Cross. “And, of course, it’s perceived that the Dodgers did so because they (spend) about $100 million more on batters and pitchers in their lineup than the (runner-up Toronto Blue) Jays did.”\n \n\n   \n  But the facts don’t back up the idea that money is everything in baseball, or that a salary cap would solve the Dodgers’ dominance. Because despite the Dodgers’ recent success and deep pockets, there is greater competition within the sport than it appears.\n \n\n   \n    Dollars don’t equal wins\n \n\n   \n  Had the Blue Jays pulled off the victory over the Dodgers on Saturday, it would have given baseball its 10th different champion in the last 12 years, a period during which the NFL, with its salary cap, has had only six different teams win the Super Bowl, and the NBA, with its cap, had eight champions.\n \n\n   \n  But in baseball, only about 10% of the difference between good teams and bad teams is due to the size of their payroll, said Matheson.\n \n\n   \n  “But there are so many things that you can’t control, like injuries and like, ‘Is that great player going to perform well at a key moment?’” Matheson said.\n \n\n   \n  Some other estimates, such as one from Andrew Zimbalist, economics professor emeritus at Smith College and a leading expert on the business of sports, put the impact of payroll higher, but still only about 25% of the difference between winning and losing.\n \n\n   \n  The team with the second-largest payroll in the sport, the New York Mets, were beat to the postseason by the small-market Cincinnati Reds, who were 19th on the payroll list.   \n \n\n   \n  The team with the best regular season record was not the deep-pocketed Dodgers but the Milwaukee Brewers, with a payroll of about a third of the Dodgers’ and No. 18 of the 30 MLB teams.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the Brewers were eventually swept by the Dodgers in the playoffs. But anything can happen in baseball’s postseason format, even when one team is considered vastly superior to another.\n \n\n   \n  “Largely what happens in the postseason is a product of randomness,” said Zimbalist. “It’s a product of which team is peaking at the right moment, which team gets better breaks, better luck at the right moment.”\n \n\n   \n  A pair of stellar plays in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series by two of the Dodgers’ lower-paid players — Miguel Rojas, who hit the game-tying home run, and Andy Pages, who made an extremely difficult catch to prevent the Blue Jays from scoring the winning run — were all that stood in the way of Toronto winning a title.\n \n\n   \n    The possibility of a lost season\n \n\n   \n  Efforts to bring about a salary cap to MLB might lead to something quite serious: a lost season — or more.\n \n\n   \n  The MLBPA has made opposition to a salary cap the hill to die on and has refused to agree to any deal that includes one. And the union doesn’t appear willing to change that stance.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate through the media, but I will tell you this: The issues that we see in the system we know can be addressed without (a salary cap),” union executive director Tony Clark said in a press conference on October 24.\n \n\n   \n  But the talk in the sport for well over a year is that the owners are more united than in the past in wanting a salary cap and are ready to go to extremes to get one.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers’ win could very well increase the chance of a work stoppage that wipes out much, if not all, of the 2027 season, said Zimbalist.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, yes, (the Dodgers’ win) will raise the stakes a little bit, and make the compromise a little bit harder to achieve,” he said. “Some owners have told me they think that it’ll take a year and a half of a lockout before the players accept the salary cap.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/middleeast/motaz-azaizas-gaza-war-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:11:00-05:00","title":"Motaz Azaiza’s photos from Gaza showed the heartbreak of war.

Now in the US, he’s looking for a way forward \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:11 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Motaz Azaiza has witnessed the horrors of war. Now he’s trying to restore his faith in humanity. For 107 days, he was a photojournalist on the front lines of a warzone in his own familiar neighborhoods, documenting the carnage wrought by relentless Israeli airstrikes in such raw and unedited detail that it was impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  Since mainstream news organizations were unable to film inside Gaza, Azaiza, like other Palestinian journalists in the strip, recorded the early days of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two years, more than 68,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials in the enclave, and with over 90% of the residential buildings destroyed, most of the population has been internally displaced.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza knows that he’s lucky to be alive. “My life is worth more now than if I was dead,” he told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of Gazans got killed. Nobody mentions their names.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 21 months since Azaiza escaped with his immediate family to Qatar; he’s now living in New York. He’s been working with aid groups to help the people of Gaza, and says he has helped raise $60 million and saved numerous lives. He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/victor-conte-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:15:00-05:00","title":"Victor Conte, Who Sold Undetectable Steroids to Elite Athletes in Baseball and Track, Has Died at 75","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Victor Conte, a former sports nutrition entrepreneur, died at 75.

steroids to elite athletes in baseball and track, has died at 75 \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:15 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Victor Conte, the architect of a scheme to provide undetectable performance-enhancing drugs to professional athletes including baseball stars Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi and Olympic track champion Marion Jones decades ago, has died. He was 75.\n \n\n   \n  Conte died Monday, SNAC System, a sports nutrition company he founded, said in a social media post. It did not disclose his cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  The federal government’s investigation into another company Conte founded, the  Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative , yielded convictions of Jones, elite sprint cyclist Tammy Thomas, and former NFL defensive lineman Dana Stubblefield along with coaches, distributors, a trainer, a chemist and a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Conte, who served four months in federal prison for dealing steroids, talked openly about his famous former clients. He went on television to say he had seen three-time Olympic medalist Jones inject herself with human growth hormone, but always stopped short of implicating Bonds, the San Francisco Giants slugger.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation led to the book “Game of Shadows.” A week after the book was published in 2006, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig hired former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to investigate steroids.\n \n\n   \n    The Steroids Era\n \n\n   \n  Conte said he sold steroids known as “the cream” and “the clear” and advised on their use to dozens of elite athletes, including Giambi, a five-time major league All-Star, the Mitchell report said.\n \n\n   \n  “The illegal use of performance-enhancing substances poses a serious threat to the integrity of the game,” the Mitchell report said. “Widespread use by players of such substances unfairly disadvantages the honest athletes who refuse to use them and raises questions about the validity of baseball records.”\n \n\n   \n  Mitchell said the problems didn’t develop overnight. Mitchell said everyone involved in baseball in the prior two decades — including commissioners, club officials, the players’ association and players — shared some responsibility for what he called “the Steroids Era.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal investigation into BALCO began with a tax agent digging through the company’s trash.\n \n\n   \n  Conte wound up pleading guilty to two of the 42 charges against him in 2005 before trial. Six of the 11 convicted people were ensnared for lying to grand jurors, federal investigators or the court.\n \n\n   \n  Bonds’ personal trainer Greg Anderson, pleaded guilty to steroid distribution charges stemming from his BALCO connections. Anderson was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home confinement.\n \n\n   \n  Bonds was charged with lying to a grand jury about receiving performance-enhancing drugs and went on trial in 2011. Prosecutors dropped the case four years later when the government decided not to appeal an overturned obstruction of justice conviction to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  A seven-time National League MVP and 14-time All-Star outfielder, Bonds ended his career after the 2007 season with 762 homers, surpassing the record of 755 that Hank Aaron set from 1954-76.

SNAC System didn’t respond to a message sent through the company’s website.\n \n\n   \n    Defiant about his role\n \n\n   \n  After serving his sentence in a minimum security prison he described as “like a men’s retreat,” Conte got back in business in 2007 by resuscitating a nutritional supplements business he had launched two decades earlier called Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning or SNAC System. He located it in the same building that once housed BALCO in Burlingame, California.\n \n\n   \n  Conte remained defiant about his central role in doling out designer steroids to elite athletes.

Masoud Popalzai, Catherine Nicholls and Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:51 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A powerful earthquake has rattled northern Afghanistan, killing at least 27 people and injuring 956 more, according to Dr. Sharafat Zaman Amar, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health. The tremor also damaged one of the country’s most beautiful mosques.\n \n\n   \n  Families were jolted awake in the early hours of Monday when the 6.3-magnitude quake struck near Mazar-i-Sharif, one of the most populated cities in the north of the country, at a shallow depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles), the  United States Geological Survey  said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search and rescue operation is underway, with a child seen pulled alive from the rubble in the north of the country in video released by the Ministry of Defense on Monday morning. The girl was taken to hospital in a critical condition, a spokesperson for the 209 Al-Fath Army Corp told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mazar-i-Sharif’s iconic Blue Mosque was damaged in the quake, footage on social media geolocated by CNN revealed, with its base littered with rubble - early evidence of the destruction captured in the shadows before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  The site is one of Afghanistan’s architectural treasures and a major point of pilgrimage, believed by some to be the resting place of Hazrat Ali, the fourth Caliph of Islam and the son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in at least nine provinces, including Kabul, lost power after electricity lines from Uzbekistan – a major supplier of power to Afghanistan – were severed.\n \n\n   \n  The state-run energy company DABS also reported cut lines from Tajikistan to Kunduz province, plunging the area into total blackout. Teams are “working urgently to restore both routes,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Government officials put the death toll at 20. In an update early Tuesday, the World Health Organization said more than 860 people were injured in northern provinces of Balkh and Samangan — rising from more than 600 overnight. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority suggested casualties could rise further as “search and rescue operations are still ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Authority for Disaster Preparedness said the quake struck at around 1 a.m. local time, impacting parts of the north, east and west, with the epicenter located in Samangan.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations (UN) confirmed it has teams on the ground “to assess needs and deliver urgent aid.”\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments from a UN flyover on Monday found “fewer signs of damage than at first feared.”\n \n\n   \n  “We went over the main populated areas where the most settlements are in the earthquake affected area,” said Richard Trenchard, the UN’s acting Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, we saw very little widespread devastation… compared to the devastating scenes we saw in Kunar,” he said, referring the 6.0-magnitude quake that stuck eastern Afghanistan in August, killing at least 2,200 people.\n \n\n   \n  Afghanistan has endured a series of earthquake in recent years that have caused thousands of deaths and the USGS models estimate the shaking from Monday’s quake could result in hundreds of fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The impoverished country’s ability to respond to natural disasters has been further impeded by a shortage in international aid following the Taliban’s successful takeover in the wake of the  chaotic withdrawal of US-led forces  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to properties was reported in the affected areas, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority said, with accounts of broken windows and structural damage to homes.\n \n\n   \n  One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif told CNN that her family “woke up terrified” after the quake struck, saying that her children ran “down the stairs screaming” when it occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “I had never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life,” said Rahima, a former school teacher, 50, adding that it broke some of her windows and damaged the plaster on some of her walls.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that my house is made of concrete in the city,” she told CNN. “I don’t know if houses made of mud have survived this earthquake in the outskirts of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The quake also blocked the Tashqurghan passage, a critical route from the capital of Kabul towards neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but rescue teams have since cleared the route, the Ministry of Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  In Tashqurghan district, rubble and debris can be seen strewn across roads as bodies are carried away following the quake, according to footage from state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA). In another clip from RTA, people can be seen carefully making their way through the debris, scanning the ground with flashlights, with wrecked vehicles nearby.\n \n\n   \n  At least three hospitals in the quake zone were overwhelmed by the sudden influx of injured people, and “urgently” need “additional medical supplies, and emergency personnel to sustain life-saving services,” according to the World Health Organization.\n \n\n   \n  The earthquake was felt in regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, three countries that border northern Afghanistan, USGS reported.\n \n\n   \n  The region was hit by at least five aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.2 magnitude in the hours after the initial quake, according to USGS.\n \n\n   \n  India offered support following the earthquake, according to a post from foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on X. He wrote, “Indian relief material for the earthquake impacted communities is being handed over today. Further supplies of medicines to reach soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children, which has also deployed a team to the area, said while the scale of the destruction will take time to clarify, the impact on children’s mental health was immediate.\n \n\n   \n  “This is tragically the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit Afghanistan. As temperatures fall, thousands of children in the earthquake-devastated east of the country are facing the winter with only tents for protection from the rain and snow,” said Samira Sayed Rahman, the organization’s programme development and advocacy director for Afghanistan. “Now, families in the north are also experiencing fear and uncertainty after this latest powerful quake.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2023, another  6.3-magnitude earthquake  took place in western Afghanistan, killing more than 2,000.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/uk/stabbings-uk-knife-crime-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Are There So Many Stabbings in Britain?

Why are there so many stabbings in Britain? \n       \n  By Catherine Nicholls, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:33 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  gruesome train stabbing  that left nine people with life-threatening injuries over the weekend has put the spotlight back on the United Kingdom’s widespread knife-crime problem.\n \n\n   \n  A 32-year-old British man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder in connection with the attack, which took place on a train traveling through central England to London on Saturday evening. He has not yet entered a plea.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians condemned the attack, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling the House of Commons on Monday that knife crime “claims far too many lives in our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Successive governments have vowed to tackle knife crime but it remains a significant issue in a country where access to firearms and other weapons is tightly controlled.\n \n\n   \n  A total of 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded in England and Wales in the 12 months up until June 2025, excluding the region of Greater Manchester, according to the UK’s Office of National Statistics (data is recorded differently in Manchester). Of these offenses, 196 were homicides, the ONS said.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the overall number of recorded knife crime offenses in the year leading up to June 2025 fell 5% when compared with the year before.\n \n\n   \n    How common are lethal stabbings in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  While the issue of knife crime is a “serious social concern,” it “should not be a source of moral hysteria,” Iain Overton, executive director of the non-governmental organization Action on Armed Violence told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  In the year leading up to March 2024, 570 homicides took place in England and Wales,  according to ONS , with 262 homicides committed using a knife or other sharp instrument. The most commonly used instrument in these homicides was a kitchen knife, ONS said. Shooting killed only 22 of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  A total of 64 teenagers aged between 13 and 19 were killed in this time frame, ONS said, with 83% of these victims being killed by a knife or sharp instrument.\n \n\n   \n  Because not all knife crime offenses are reported to police, hospital data can also help in understanding the extent of the issue.\n \n\n   \n  From April 2024 to 2025, there were 3,494 instances in which patients were admitted to hospital in England for assault by sharp object, according to NHS England data. Nearly 90% of patients treated were male, with 16% of patients aged 18 or under.\n \n\n   \n  Scotland and Northern Ireland record crime separately to England and Wales. A total of 28 homicides were committed by sharp instrument in Scotland from 2023 to 2024, and four in Northern Ireland in the same time frame.\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, a total of 1,704 people were killed by a “cut” or “pierce” in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This type of crime is the result of “an incision, slash, perforation, or puncture by a pointed or sharp instrument, weapon, or object,” according to US public service organization  The National Safety Council. \n \n\n   \n  The homicide rate for England and Wales was 9.5 per million people in the year from March 2023 to 2024, according to the ONS. In the US, the rate was much higher, with 68 homicides per million people in 2023, according to the CDC.\n \n\n   \n  In the European Union, home to nearly 450 million people, there were 3,980 intentional homicides in 2023, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.\n \n\n   \n    What are the root causes of the problem?\n \n\n   \n  In a briefing issued in October, the UK’s Local Government Association called knife crime a “multifaceted issue that cannot be solved through enforcement alone.”\n \n\n   \n  Deprivation, mental health issues, exclusion from school and family struggles can all contribute to a person’s involvement in knife crime, Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay, economist and director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Crime, Justice and Policing, told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While a decade ago the majority of knife crime perpetrated by young people was related to gangs, this is no longer the case, James Alexander, an associate enterprise fellow in criminology at London Metropolitan University, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really predictable,” Alexander said. “Now with young people, you can’t predict it. There are people getting involved in knife crime, getting arrested for carrying knives or being stabbed or stabbing people that have got no criminal record whatsoever, no indications (that they might commit knife crimes),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  With violence, or the threat of it, being so pervasive in today’s society, many young people now carry knives out of fear for their own safety, Alexander said. If they feel threatened, instead of running away or fighting without weapons, they resort to using knives, often with devastating consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the young people who have grown up in a “culture where violence is accepted” then go on to become violent adults, Alexander said.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve got a lot of unsupported young men becoming adults that are not developing in the way that they would if they were supported. Then they’re taking their violent tendencies into adulthood, which is a big concern for lots of people.”\n \n\n   \n    What is being done to tackle knife crime?\n \n\n   \n  During campaigning for Britain’s 2024 parliamentary elections, the now-governing Labour Party pledged to try to “halve knife crime in a decade.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Home Office, “nearly 60,000 knives have been removed from streets in England and Wales through new knife surrender schemes and police operations” since Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government took office.\n \n\n   \n  Weapons including so-called zombie knives and ninja swords have also been banned, and age verification checks for the online sale and delivery of knives are being strengthened,the Home Office said. The progress made this year includes a 5% fall in all knife crimes, including an 18% reduction in homicides by knife, the Home Secretary told lawmakers on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  However, Overton from Action on Armed Violence said that while enforcement helps in combating knife crime, “this is not simply a policing issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Cuts to youth and mental-health services, poverty, exclusion, and the exploitation of children by drug networks have all helped create the conditions for violence,” he said. “The real work lies in prevention: through education, community investment, and early intervention.”\n \n\n   \n  One example of effective prevention is  Operation Divan , a police-led initiative that aims to discourage the carrying of knives by young people in the English county of North Yorkshire, Bandyopadhyay said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the initiative, if there are concerns that a young person might be interacting with knives, the police will work with local services to discuss the dangers of knives with that young person. This also helps authorities to learn more about why young people are interacting with knives.\n \n\n   \n  There is a “significant opportunity for (the) early diversion” of young people away from knife crime through “voluntary educational interventions,” Bandyopadhyay said.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander from London Metropolitan University said that while he had evaluated “quite a few amazing interventions” when it comes to knife crime, they often only run for a few years due to a lack of funding.\n \n\n   \n  “The government is doing some really practical things” when it comes to clamping down on the sale of sharp weapons, Alexander said. “But I think actually, when you look at a lot of young people, they (are)… quite damaged young people.”\n \n\n   \n  They need support, he continued, “but it doesn’t necessarily need to be done by a therapist. They just need a space where they can be a child” and feel safe without needing a knife.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/china/us-china-red-lines-xie-feng-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:21:00-05:00","title":"China Warns Taiwan and Human Rights Remain Among Its ‘Red Lines’ After Trump-Xi Talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea, China has reiterated four 'red lines'—Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development—that it insists must not be crossed to maintain stable US-China relations.

after Trump-Xi talks \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:21 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has called for the US to avoid crossing four sensitive “red lines” in order to keep the two countries’ relations on track following a  high-stakes meeting  between leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump last week.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development are “China’s four red lines,” China’s ambassador to the US Xie Feng said during a  virtual address  to American and Chinese businesspeople in Shanghai on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope the US side will avoid crossing them and causing trouble,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Xie made the remarks to an event hosted by the US-China Business Council, according to a readout released by the Chinese Embassy in the US, in comments that come days after Xi and Trump held their landmark meeting last week on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Those talks – the leaders’ first since Trump’s return to the White House earlier this year – have been widely seen as a significant step in de-escalating frictions between the two superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Now, keeping those relations on track would require both sides to “respect each other’s core interests and major concerns,” said Xie, adding that the “pressing priority” was “to follow up on the consensus reached between the two presidents.”\n \n\n   \n  “It would be unacceptable to say one thing but do another, cause any new disruption, make zero-sum calculations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, the four “red lines” elaborated by Xie are longstanding sensitive areas that could enflame tensions if mishandled – the most prominent of which is Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China’s ruling Communist Party views as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has long been irked by Washington’s unofficial relationship with Taipei, and the island often features in high-level diplomatic conversations between the two sides. Trump on Sunday told  CBS’ 60 Minutes  that the subject did not arise during the meeting last week.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has in the past bristled at what it sees as US efforts to interfere in China’s domestic affairs, including American officials voicing concerns about limits to freedoms of expression within China’s tightly controlled political system and alleged human rights violations.\n \n\n   \n  While figures within the Trump administration like US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have long been vocal around such issues, they did not appear to be raised by Trump during the recent hour-and-forty-minute meeting with Xi, which focused on their bilateral economic relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Those talks ended without a formal trade deal, but saw Beijing agree to pause for a year a sweeping expansion of its export controls on rare earth minerals, while Washington would similarly defer measures that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese firms blacklisted from accessing certain sensitive US technologies.\n \n\n   \n  The two sides also extended a truce reached earlier this year that brought down their tit-for-tat tariffs from levels that would have amounted to a de facto trade embargo.\n \n\n   \n  The measures were greeted with relief by many in the global business community, which for months has been ensnared in the uncertainty of up-and-down economic frictions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  Xie, Beijing’s top envoy in Washington, picked up that thread in his remarks on Monday, as he called on business leaders to “build on the positive momentum” of the summit and “remain optimistic about China’s future and committed to the Chinese market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-05:00","title":"Jonathan Bailey Is Named 'Sexiest Man Alive' by People Magazine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"People Magazine has named Jonathan Bailey, the star of 'Wicked' and 'Bridgerton,' as its 'Sexiest Man Alive' for 2025.

Tens of thousands of callous-handed firefighters and tender veterinarians each year are snubbed in favor of bankable Hollywood stars that, coincidentally, tend to bring attention to suffering magazines. (People Inc., which is owned by Barry Diller’s IAC,  laid off  6 percent of its workforce last month.)\n \n\n   \n  This year, the actor Jonathan Bailey was named to the honorary unpaid position. The “ Wicked ” and “Bridgerton” star is likely the first publicly out gay person to receive the award, unless there’s something we don’t know about some of honorees who preceded him. “It’s the honor of a lifetime,” Bailey told Jimmy Fallon.\n \n\n   \n  The magazine did two covers, one with Bailey’s dog, Benson.\n \n\n   \n  Here are answers to some other questions.\n \n\n   \n    Do they have to eliminate the previous sexiest man each year?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not required to rid society of the outgoing sexiest man. He is simply demoted in sexiness without fanfare. This year’s winner would have “big shoes to fill,” People magazine warned, and those shoes belong to 2024’s sexy fella, John Krasinski. (He is a size 12 US,  according to  Wikifeet.) Krasinski also has the least interesting yet very successful Hollywood career imaginable, but that doesn’t mean he should be exiled or worse. He can next be seen playing glamorous Paramount intellectual property character Jack Ryan, whom he’s played in an Amazon series for four seasons, in the sixth film of the franchise.\n \n\n   \n    What are the criteria for being described as this sexy?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just appearance, the editors of People have said,  mentioning  shadily that “looks aren’t just what the candidates are judged by,” adding that they included Michael B. Jordan because of his political activism. So you can be sexy with an asterisk and feel bad forever.\n \n\n   \n    How much does the award cost and/or pay?\n \n\n   \n  Unknown, actually! Like a presidential library (approaching  a billion dollars ) or a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ($ 85,000 ), the price, if any, of being declared People’s Sexiest Man Alive may be extravagant, but we suspect the real toll is only spiritual. Andrea Lavinthal, the magazine’s Executive Director of Special Integrated Projects, recently  said loudly  that they do not pay the honoree … and that the honoree does not pay the magazine.\n \n\n   \n    Are there other sexy men alive?\n \n\n   \n  A few. The people also get to say who is sexy, and prior to the official announcement, the people’s choices  are announced . They include men as variously sexy as the “sexiest new dad in sports,” who is Christian McCaffrey. The Sexiest Cat Dad title was won by Dave Franco.\n \n\n   \n    Is the prize of being the sexiest man alive cursed?\n \n\n   \n  Yes! Just like many other titles, such as the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and  England’s “Duke of York,”  this one also comes with a dark undercurrent. For instance, all of the people named Sexiest Man Alive are marked for death at a later date. Many have lived through years of war and terrorism. Most will also suffer from divorce, failed franchises, hair loss and sudden hair regrowth. Still, it’s nice to think that having once been named as extremely, extravagantly sexy must keep them warm on the coldest of nights.\n \n\n   \n    Do you want to feel old?\n \n\n   \n  Brad Pitt was first named sexiest man alive in 1995, the same year we got the phrase, “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/ups-plane-crash-louisville-airport","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00.000Z","title":"UPS Plane Crashes Near Louisville Airport, Three Crew On Board","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 freighter crashed shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 4, 2025, en route to Daniel K.

stock market victory that no one saw coming \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year after President Donald Trump’s reelection, the US stock market continues to notch  record highs .\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors’ enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.\n \n\n   \n  To Trump, the market’s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 28 touted stocks’ record highs during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Their stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,” Trump  said . “That means we’re doing something right.”\n \n\n   \n  But some analysts say the stock market’s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.\n \n\n   \n  “What happens in Washington matters, but it’s not the only thing that matters,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. “Despite all the shifting narratives, the key theme for this year is the dominance of tech and AI and the continued resilience of corporate America.”\n \n\n   \n    Ascent to all-time highs\n \n\n   \n  The stock market’s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump’s “pretty aggressive changes and approaches” to US trade policy and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump’s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,” Ellerbroek said. “The market hates uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  Investors have turned their attention to the AI trade and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things,” Ellerbroek said.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia ( NVDA ), which just hit  $5 trillion  in market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500’s market value.\n \n\n   \n  An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index’s 19.6% gain.\n \n\n   \n    Weathering tariff turmoil\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out his  plan for tariffs . But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks may be higher in part because the administration’s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,” said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. “Were it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.”\n \n\n   \n  From Trump’s election through the end of October, the S&P 500’s rise was the eighth best for a president’s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden’s term, marking the best performance on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the US stock market’s gains this year pale in comparison to global markets. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index has soared 66% across the past 12 months. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 28%. Benchmark stock indexes in Poland and Greece have gained roughly 52% and 60%, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  While stocks are near record highs, the Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and attacks on the Fed’s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.\n \n\n   \n  The 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in October.\n \n\n   \n  “What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market,” Bessent said. “You’ve got to respect the market.”\n \n\n   \n    Taking the baton\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was reelected,  investors cheered  the potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market’s ascent.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately you zoom back and you say, ‘All right, it’s an AI bull market,’” Mayfield said. “The administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.”\n \n\n   \n  Mayfield said he expects the rally to continue, but he is also cautious about a potential pullback, given just how far things have run.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t expect a smooth ride,” he said. “I would expect a correction at some point in the next 12 months — 10% to 15% maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  A growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs concurs: David Solomon, chief executive at Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will be a 10% to 20% drawdown in stocks sometime in the next one to two years.\n \n\n   \n  “Things run and they pull back so people can reassess,” Solomon said during a panel at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  While the S&P 500 continues to hit record highs, the index is being carried by big tech and AI. It leaves everyday investors and 401(k)s increasingly exposed to enormous gains, but vulnerable to a downturn.\n \n\n   \n  To Lerner at Truist, the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n \n\n   \n  “The North Star of this bull market is corporate profits,” Lerner said.\n \n\n   \n  But with stocks trading at historically expensive levels, there are risks abound.\n \n\n   \n  “When you haven’t had a pullback since April, I think you’re just more susceptible to negative surprises, whatever those may be,” Lerner said. “You might be somewhat less able to absorb them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/china-nexperia-chip-exports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"04:02:00-05:00","title":"China backs off chip export ban that could have shut down global auto plants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has reversed its export ban on critical automotive chips from Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor company based in the Netherlands, following pressure from US and European automakers.

It’s a critical supplier for the global auto industry, providing 40% of the automotive chips in the market segment that includes transistors and diodes, according to research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  After the Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia several weeks ago and removed its Chinese CEO, citing national security concerns, Beijing suspended shipments from China. Auto industry trade groups in the United States and Europe both feared the trade dispute would lead them to run out of the chips they needed. That could drive up  car prices , as happened in the years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  After US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping  met last week , Beijing said it would allow customers to apply for exemptions from a recently imposed export control and get the chips they need.\n \n\n   \n  “As a responsible major country, China fully considers the security and stability of domestic and international supply chains,” according to a statement on Saturday from China’s Ministry of Commerce. “We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the companies and grant exemptions to eligible exports.”\n \n\n   \n  The  statement  also said that “the Dutch government’s inappropriate interference in the company’s internal affairs (had) led to the current chaos in the global supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate  statement  on Tuesday, the ministry claimed “the Dutch side continues to act unilaterally” and warned that this would “inevitably deepen the adverse effects on the global semiconductor supply chain.”\n \n\n   \n  It said China was acting responsibly by announcing that it would exempt qualified exports and urged Dutch authorities to “act from the perspective of maintaining the overall stability and security” of trade relations between China and the Netherlands and China and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs told CNN: “We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch government  took control  of Nexperia last month under pressure from the US government, which had placed its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, on a blacklist of companies it saw as posing a national security threat.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York City voters will choose their next mayor Tuesday, closing out an eventful campaign between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  In the months after Mamdani’s surprise Democratic primary win, the 34-year-old democratic socialist has sought to grow his base and reassure voters wary of his criticisms of Israel’s government and his past support for far-left policies such as defunding the police. His opponents, meanwhile, have revamped their campaigns to try to cut into the front-runner’s support.\n \n\n   \n  Here are seven stories to get you up to speed on Tuesday’s election:\n \n\n   \n    First, Andrew Cuomo’s primary campaign collapsed\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo entered the mayoral race as the frontrunner despite sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied, that forced him to resign from office in 2021. But the former governor relied on name recognition and donor support instead of building out an extensive ground game, leading to his surprise loss in the June Democratic primary to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “Mamdani’s historic expansion of the electorate, his tapping into the hunger for a leftward lurch and fresh voice, defied almost every poll and expert’s expectation,”  CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reported . “But all but a few involved with the Cuomo campaign acknowledge, at least privately, how much they did wrong.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic socialists were emboldened and started talking primary challenges\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s surprise win emboldened the democratic socialists in New York City, who warned they were  considering primary challenges  against five incumbent House Democrats, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries’ team nicknamed the potential challengers “Team Gentrification.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani pivoted from anti-police rhetoric\n \n\n   \n  Part of Mamdani’s efforts to broaden his coalition has included  reaching out to police officers  and stepping away from his past calls to defund the police. The mayoral candidate met with off-duty police officers and held meetings on the proposals in his public safety agenda, which would overhaul the way the city approaches its most vulnerable residents.\n \n\n   \n    The Republican with many cats\n \n\n   \n  New York City hasn’t had a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg left office in 2013. But Republicans did not fully rally around their nominee:  Sliwa , a radio host, a founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, and a famous fan of fostering cats. Sliwa has campaigned by riding the subway and running on a tough-on-crime platform. He argued that his longtime ties to the city might help him reach voters who are otherwise opposed to Republican candidates. To the end, he refused to withdraw from the race despite pressure from Cuomo and others who wanted to consolidate the anti-Mamdani opposition.\n \n\n   \n  “When they come up to me, they don’t say, ‘Oh, the Republican,’” Sliwa told CNN. “They don’t see me as a politician. They see me as one of them, which is rare.”\n \n\n   \n    The diverse street at the center of the race\n \n\n   \n  Roosevelt Avenue, a diverse street in Queens that is also a hotspot for sex work,  became a focal point in the mayoral race  and debates over quality of life. Mamdani’s opponents criticized his support for decriminalizing sex work, pointing to it as evidence that he is soft on crime. Cuomo also hoped to use the issue to reach South Asian and Muslim voters. Mamdani has clarified that he doesn’t support legalizing sex work, but that he backs decriminalizing the practice between consenting adults.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling, who are currently being thrown in jail,” Mamdani said at a mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n    Many Jewish voters felt they had bad options\n \n\n   \n  For many Jewish New Yorkers, the New York City mayoral election has become emotionally fraught.  Some voters who spoke with CNN  said they were reluctant to support Mamdani due to his pro-Palestinian activism and criticisms of Israel’s government. Mamdani sought to reach out to Jewish New Yorkers, but the most recent pre-election polls still showed Cuomo drawing around 55% of the Jewish vote.\n \n\n   \n    A different kind of potential first lady\n \n\n   \n  Rama Duwaji, Mamdani’s 28-year-old artist wife,  carved her own path  ahead of potentially becoming New York City’s next first lady. She was not a high-profile surrogate for the campaign. Instead, her influence was felt behind the scenes and on social media, where she promoted her artwork focused on Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/running-shark-attack-victim-paralympian-nyc-marathon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Meet the shark-attack victim and Paralympian who finished the New York City marathon","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ali Truwit, a Paralympian and former competitive swimmer at Yale, survived a shark attack in Turks and Caicos in 2023 that resulted in the amputation of her left foot and lower leg.

New York City marathon \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Ali Truwit crossed the finish line at the Copenhagen Marathon in 2023, she couldn’t have imagined how hard it would be to run the 26.2-mile distance again.\n \n\n   \n  Just 10 days later, she was bitten by a shark while snorkeling in Turks and Caicos and, although she was lucky to escape with her life, her left foot and the lower part of her leg were lost in the attack.\n \n\n   \n  But at the New York City Marathon in 2025, Truwit finished another marathon, completing the most remarkable comeback from  a devastating physical and psychological trauma. \n \n\n   \n  “I’m over the moon,” she exclaimed to CNN in an interview the next day, “I’m definitely feeling the race a little bit, but still feeling on top of the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who’s ever run a marathon will tell you about the grueling nature of the challenge, but few could imagine having to remove their leg multiple times throughout the race.\n \n\n   \n  “Still feels crazy to say,” she said, explaining that the sweat was making her prosthetic limb slip on her leg.\n \n\n   \n  After one such stop, Truwit posted a video to her Instagram story of her bouncing up and down at the side of the road to put her prosthetic back on. Another challenge was her inability to feel the ground beneath her, particularly around the five bridges along the iconic route.\n \n\n   \n  “Learning how to do it without an ankle, which is typically how you adjust for the incline and decline, was totally new,” she said, noting that it was also hard not to slip on all the water and discarded cups around the hydration stations every mile. “There were a lot of nuances to navigate with a blade.”\n \n\n   \n  Since that fateful day in May 2023, Truwit’s journey has been remarkable and inspirational. A competitive swimmer at Yale University, she said that getting back into the water triggered flashbacks of the attack, but within just 16 months she’d conquered her fear to  win two silver medals at the Paralympics in Paris. \n \n\n   \n  In New York, she reclaimed more of her life, running alongside her former teammate Sophie Pilkinton and another 13 family and friends – the people who saved her life and helped her to rebuild it. Pilkinton was there from the start, helping to fight off the shark and swim back to the boat where she applied a life-saving tourniquet; now Truwit says they’re like sisters.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredibly special bond,” Truwit said. “To come through a shark attack like that and survive together and save each other, to be running a marathon side by side, step by step, it’s just such a testament to her support and our friendship. Truly something I’m going to cherish for the rest of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit says that each stage of her recovery has been challenging, but in different ways.\n \n\n   \n  “Swimming was hard because of the traumatic memories I had associated with the water, (but) I don’t swim with my prosthetic, whereas with running I have to use that prosthetic to help me get where I want to go,” she told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s a big challenge, you know, navigate the swelling and all of those frustrations. Running is physically harder; swimming was emotionally harder.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite her obvious triumphs, Truwit says that she’s still recovering from the attack, she’s still a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “Grief comes in waves,” she laments. “I grieve different things at different times. I’ve made a lot of progress on my healing journey, and I think there’s still a-ways to go.”\n \n\n   \n  Many have asked if she had the power to go back and rewrite her history, would she?\n \n\n   \n  “Not to have my life as an amputee would have been easier,” she explained. “I wish it hadn’t happened, but I’m really thankful that I now have this opportunity and platform to impact other people too.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit and her entourage ran New York in blue T-shirts with the name of her charity, “Stronger Than You Think,” stamped in white letters on the back. By the end of the day, they’d raised $220,000. Throughout the race, she glanced at the home screen of her cell phone, a patchwork of the nine women and girls that she has helped to find their own prosthetic limbs.\n \n\n   \n  “I was really shocked at how expensive prosthetics are and how little insurance covers relative to what’s needed,” she said. “These prosthetics are our mobility, our quality of life, our ability to go back to our careers and families and passions, so I wanted to do something about it. It’s been the most healing work for me to take this bad thing and use it for good. Our recipients give me hope and inspiration and joy, and it really was a goal for me, to not just give the prosthetics, but to create community and friendship and support among us.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit’s positive attitude is infectious, she’s able to recall the most awful moment of her life with a smile and the social media videos documenting a painful recovery depict a joyful young woman; it’s as if the experience of being so close to death has infused her with a new love of life.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been given a second chance,” she explained, “I came face to face with that almost not being my reality. You want to live life fully and beautifully and joyfully. Of course, there’s hard moments, I just kind of believe that smiling tricks my brain a little bit, even when I’m in pain or things are hard, I smile to send my body the message, I’m so grateful to be alive right now and I know what a privilege that is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/sara-ellis-judge-greg-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Obama-Appointed Judge Sara Ellis Orders Federal Agents to Avoid Violent Tactics Against Chicago Protesters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sara L.

\n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal judge in Illinois who ordered federal agents to limit aggressive tactics against protesters is known for her stern tone and an extensive career in civil and criminal litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have defended themselves in court as Judge Sara L. Ellis of the Northern District of Illinois has repeatedly pressed federal officials and demanded explanations for their response to intense protests in Chicago amid “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has   raised concerns a temporary restraining order she issued last month to block agents from using certain types of force against protesters was being violated. The courtroom felt like a principal’s office as Ellis detailed examples of incidents where she felt her order wasn’t being followed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not blind, right?” Ellis  said .\n \n\n   \n  While Ellis’ approach has been viewed by some as assertive oversight of executive powers, Ellis’ former colleagues who spoke with CNN described her as someone who dispenses evenhanded justice.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing last week, Ellis cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing tear gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis took on civil rights lawsuits and white-collar criminal defense for nearly 20 years before former President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench during his second term. The Canadian-born judge had previously discussed her experience as an immigrant to the US and indirectly addressed President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a US district judge, Ellis has taken on noteworthy cases ranging from Covid-19 restrictions to immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Judge Ellis calls the balls and strikes fairly in every case, applying the law without letting personal views play any role,” Corey Rubenstein, a Chicago attorney who has known Ellis for 25 years, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former colleague, William Ziegelmueller, said Ellis’ response “shows that she views herself as part of the community, not a resident of a lofty ivory tower, and understands that her rulings directly impact the lives of everyone in her community.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Having Sara on the other side was like going to war’\n \n\n   \n  Ellis received her bachelor’s degree in 1991 from Indiana University and her Juris Doctor in 1994 from Loyola University Chicago School of Law, according to  the Federal Judicial Center .\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming a judge, Ellis  practiced  almost exclusively in federal court as a litigator for criminal and civil matters, trying  11 cases  to verdict.\n \n\n   \n  After graduating from law school, Ellis began her career as a staff attorney at the Federal Defender Program in Chicago, according to the  district court . Ronald Safer, who met her when she was in that position, said she excelled as a young lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  “She is kind and gentle. Her demeanor led some people to underestimate her,” Safer told CNN. “They did so at their peril. Sara was a fierce advocate. She was a whip-smart legal analyst … Having Sara on the other side was like going to war.”\n \n\n   \n  She worked at a white-collar criminal defense law firm for four years before serving as assistant corporation counsel for the City of Chicago Department of Law, where she handled class claims for injunctive relief and civil rights lawsuits. Working for the city was like “living in the eye of the hurricane,” but Ellis “tried to bring order to chaos,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a defense lawyer, her compassion for her clients guided her every move,” said Rubenstein, who worked with Ellis at Stetler, Duffy and Rotert, Ltd.\n \n\n   \n  She also worked as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Chicago for several years. Before becoming a federal judge, Ellis worked at another Chicago law firm, where she handled criminal and civil cases.\n \n\n   \n  “She was admired and beloved by her colleagues and her clients,” said Safer, who worked with Ellis at Schiff Hardin LLP. One of her strong suits, he said, was she could talk to a jury as a peer.\n \n\n   \n  Her  pro bono work  included challenging solitary confinement for extended periods of time and advocating for the inclusion of female baseball players on high school baseball teams. She also volunteered to represent a Lake County, Illinois, man who Safer said had been wrongfully convicted.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Ellis has a distinguished record of pro bono work and community service,” Sen. Dick Durbin said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n  Rubenstein said Ellis “cares about the little guy, the downtrodden as much as any jurist I have known.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have been a zealous advocate for my clients’\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Durbin recommended Ellis and Judge Andrea Wood to Obama for judgeship positions, according to the district court. Obama then nominated Ellis on  May 6, 2013 , to a seat vacated by Joan B. Gottschall.\n \n\n   \n  “Sara Ellis and Andrea Wood are both experienced attorneys in federal court practice,” said former Chief Judge James Holderman in a  statement  following the nomination. “I have no doubt that they will be outstanding district judges on our court.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a Senate questionnaire, Ellis  said  her goal is “to adhere to the rule of law and apply the law in a fair and impartial manner.” She also said she aimed to treat “all litigants with courtesy, respect, and an even hand” and resolve legal issues “promptly, decisively, and after thorough application of the relevant legal principles to the facts at hand.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have been a zealous advocate for my clients regardless of their political beliefs, financial standing, or their role in the case as plaintiff or defendant,” Ellis wrote, adding she has represented members of law enforcement as well as criminal defendants.\n \n\n   \n  At her confirmation hearing, Ellis said she believes a judge should work “efficiently and expediently because justice delayed is justice denied.”\n \n\n   \n  The Senate confirmed Ellis by voice vote in October 2013.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I am an immigrant just like you’\n \n\n   \n  Born in Ontario, Canada, to Jamaican-born parents in 1969, Ellis became a US citizen at age 15, according to  Senate records . In 2017, Ellis  compared  her own swearing in as a new citizen to that of 117 United States citizens she swore in.\n \n\n   \n  “Thirty years ago, I took this very same oath. I am an immigrant just like you,” she said at the time. Ellis then asked a new citizen from Syria to lead the Pledge of Allegiance as the group rose and placed their hands over their hearts.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis remembered the “very hot, cramped immigration office” in Indianapolis as she stood next to her brother and sister. Giving her oath of allegiance to the US was an extremely powerful experience for her, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was moved by those words then, and I continue to be moved by those words 30 years later,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time,   Trump had issued an executive order banning travel from seven countries and all refugees from entry into the US. Although Ellis hadn’t mentioned Trump by name, her message had a clear target audience.\n \n\n   \n  “There are very negative things that have been said and negative opinions that have been voiced,” Ellis said at the ceremony. “I want you to know and believe in your heart that you are welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n    Ellis ‘dispenses justice with patience and firmness’\n \n\n   \n  As a judge, Ellis has ruled on a wide range of issues,   from public health to voter registration records.\n \n\n   \n  “What stands out about Judge Ellis as a judge is the kindness, compassion, and humanity that she routinely displays through her rulings and interactions with litigants,” Ziegelmueller said.\n \n\n   \n  Safer said Ellis “dispenses justice with patience and firmness. She decides.” He added Ellis was never on the  “Biden list, ” which refers to federal judges who have a significant number of case motions pending for long periods.\n \n\n   \n  “She controls her courtroom not by demanded obedience – although she will do so if necessary – but by commanding respect,” Safer said, adding she has an “iron will.”\n \n\n   \n  One notable case in 2020 involved a  lawsuit  by the Illinois Republican Party. Ellis denied a motion for an injunction against Gov. JB Pritzker’s executive order that placed gathering size restrictions on political parties, finding the state was not treating political parties differently from other similar groups.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, a case brought by Judicial Watch sought access to Illinois voter registration records and to remove allegedly ineligible voters. Ellis dismissed part of the case for lack of standing. The case is ongoing, with the only remaining claim alleging Illinois failed to make reasonable efforts to remove ineligible voters due to a change of residence.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, Ellis has served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency for US federal courts. Ellis has also been a key player in the  court’s reentry program , Safer said.\n \n\n   \n    Ellis’ ruling ‘will be measured and it will be sound’\n \n\n   \n  As Trump intensifies his immigration crackdown during his second term, Ellis’ rulings regarding the Chicago-area protests have received sharp criticism from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “DHS will continue to oppose all efforts to vilify law enforcement and prop up the cause of violent rioters,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin  told  The Associated Press after Ellis indicated in court her temporary restraining order would be expanded to require agents wear body cameras during immigration enforcement. “Were a court to enter such an order in the future, that would be an extreme act of judicial activism.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis declined to be interviewed for this story.\n \n\n   \n  The controversial immigration operation in Chicago has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September and has drawn legal challenges from plaintiffs who accuse federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week told Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino he must be in court daily for a week as she considers reports federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions. Bovino had been ordered to appear in court after plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has rebutted.   \n \n\n   \n  But the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday wiped away Ellis’ order mandating check-ins, saying she had overstepped her authority.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration argued Bovino having to appear before Ellis would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will go moving forward, but Safer says Ellis’ ruling “will be measured and it will be sound.” She will take the time to gather the facts and rule based on what is right under the law without dragging the case out, Safer expects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the federal government thinks they can trifle with her and her orders, it is because they brought in people from Washington who do not know her. If the plaintiffs think she will go outside the law to protect people just because her heart goes out to them, they will be disappointed,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Bovino thinks he is tougher than she is, he will find that he is sadly mistaken.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/starbucks-to-sell-control-of-china-business","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:08:00.000-05:00","title":"Starbucks to sell control of China business to Boyu Capital in $4 billion deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Starbucks announced a $4 billion deal to sell control of its China operations to investment firm Boyu Capital, with Boyu holding up to 60% of the joint venture and Starbucks retaining a 40% stake and ownership of the brand and intellectual property.

At stake are tens of billions of dollars in revenue the administration has already collected and potentially trillions more – and the resolution of a power struggle that both sides have framed in existential terms.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some key points to watch as the nine justices take their seats to hear the case at 10 am ET.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do it?\n \n\n   \n  The blockbuster battle over tariffs will likely be decided based on how a majority of the court defines a single word: “regulate.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to levy the import duties. That law allows a president to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. The administration argues the word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, since tariffs are the most common way a government regulates imports.\n \n\n   \n  But the  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging  Trump note that the law – at no point – uses the words “tariffs” or “duties.” A far more logical reading of the law, they say, is that it allows a president to impose sanctions on other countries during emergencies. After all, they point out, Trump has  other laws at his disposal  that he could use to raise tariffs to deal with trade imbalances.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just that those other laws have limits and IEEPA, for the most part, does not.\n \n\n   \n  Lower courts have consistently sided against Trump in the two cases now before the Supreme Court, though they have spelled out different rationales and implications – something the Justice Department has pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  In one case, led by V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based wine and spirits company, a divided Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that IEEPA might permit some tariffs, just not the  widespread duties Trump has carried out . In another case, led by an educational toy company called Learning Resources, a federal district court in Washington, DC, ruled that the law likely didn’t grant the president power to impose the tariffs at all.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Joe Biden\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court was clear in  case  after  case  involving President Joe Biden that an administration cannot take certain actions without explicit authorization from Congress. That is particularly true, the court has  repeatedly ruled , when policies involve “major” political or economic questions.\n \n\n   \n  Two years ago, the court’s conservative majority relied on what’s known as the “major questions doctrine” to block  Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan . A year earlier, the court stopped Biden’s vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses challenging Trump say the same logic should apply to the tariffs. The law Trump is relying on, they point out, never uses the word “tariff.”\n \n\n   \n  How the conservative justices wrestle with that argument may tell observers everything they need to know about where the court is heading in this case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has offered the court a few arguments to bypass the doctrine that was repeatedly used against Biden. First, the administration says, those earlier cases involved agencies taking action – like the Department of Education when it came to student loan forgiveness. Second, Trump argues, the tariffs implicate foreign affairs, where a president has long been given a lot of leeway by the other branches.\n \n\n   \n  If key justices quickly distinguish the Biden-era cases on one of those grounds, that will be a good sign for the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Richard Nixon\n \n\n   \n  Trump is relying, at least in part, on a similar effort undertaken by President Richard Nixon more than five decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 1971, Nixon imposed a 10% tariff on all imports – which the administration later justified under the Trading with the Enemy Act, a precursor to IEEPA that was enacted during World War I. Notably, that law used identical language to give the president authority to “regulate” imports. And at the time, a federal appeals court approved those tariffs with the same language.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in Congress were clearly aware of that when they enacted IEEPA with that same language. And that, the Department of Justice has argued, “strongly indicates that both Congress and the public contemporaneously understood that language to encompass tariffs.”\n \n\n   \n  The businesses challenging Trump have balked at that logic. They agree that Congress kept the “regulate” language in place for emergencies but said that, in response to Nixon, Congress also passed a law with clear instructions for when a president could unilaterally impose tariffs to address a trade imbalance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump doesn’t want to use that law, however, because it imposes limits on tariffs – capping them at 15% and permitting them for only 150 days.\n \n\n   \n  How the court’s conservatives weigh that history could influence the outcome of the case, particularly if some signal that Trump’s actions have no historic precedent.\n \n\n   \n    Tariff or a tax?\n \n\n   \n  For years,  economists have shaken their heads  as the president and other White House officials have repeatedly described tariffs as a duty paid by foreign companies. The debate over how to depict the tariffs has taken on legal significance in the case before the Supreme Court, and how the justices deal with it could provide clues about their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging the tariffs  call them a tax, which they note falls squarely within the power of Congress under the Constitution to levy – not a president. Because tariffs are paid “primarily by American businesses,” and ultimately American consumers, the plaintiffs told the Supreme Court in written arguments, the president’s tariffs have “equated to the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps sensing the danger in that argument, the Department of Justice spent a significant portion of its most recent brief in late October distinguishing between tariffs and taxes. US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney, blasted the plaintiffs for relying on a “repeated, false equivalence between domestic revenue-raising taxes and regulatory tariffs on foreign imports.”\n \n\n   \n  What Trump has imposed under IEEPA, Sauer said, are “regulatory tariffs” on foreign imports to “deal with foreign threats,” which he said, “crucially differ from domestic taxation.”\n \n\n   \n    Vassal States of America\n \n\n   \n  After floating the idea of attending the oral arguments in person on Wednesday, Trump said over the weekend  he would skip the session .\n \n\n   \n  Even though the president will be elsewhere, his heightened rhetoric is all over the case. The Justice Department has used unusually striking language to warn the justices about what might happen if the court ultimately rules against the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer has quoted administration officials framing a loss as a “catastrophic” and “ruinous” outcome that would lead to a “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.” Upholding the lower courts, the administration said, would “accelerate the drift toward America’s decline into a vassal state.”\n \n\n   \n  That language is clearly designed to give the justices pause about the practical implications of their decision, even though the court’s conservatives have long espoused the idea that they make decisions based on the law as they find it, not on potential consequences.\n \n\n   \n  It will be worth watching whether Sauer doubles down on that strategy as he looks up at the bench on Wednesday from the podium.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a dozen states that oppose the administration, criticized the Justice Department for its “hyperbolic rhetoric” and quoted from a  concurring opinion from three conservative justices  – Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – when the court tossed out Biden’s vaccine requirements.\n \n\n   \n  “The question, as in other recent cases of executive overreach, is: ‘Who decides?’” the states wrote. “Congress, not the president, decides whether and how much to tax Americans who import goods from abroad.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/china/china-xi-laughing-images-apec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:48:00-05:00","title":"The White House has shared images of Xi Jinping that most Chinese don’t see at home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House released images of Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in South Korea, revealing a more relaxed and candid side during a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump and a humorous exchange with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

The issue has prompted a raft of allegations between China and other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has recently expressed concerns over a US proposal to have advanced chips sold abroad fitted with tracking, a suggestion that prompted  US chipmaker Nvidia to say its chips had no “backdoors.”  Meanwhile, numerous Western countries have raised cybersecurity concerns regarding certain China-made devices.\n \n\n   \n  The two off-the-cuff moments from Xi contrast with his carefully crafted image at home, where he was recently shown  presiding over a military parade in a Mao suit , an outfit associated with Mao Zedong, Communist China’s founding father.\n \n\n   \n  Before his meeting with Trump, he chaired a party  plenum , delivering speeches in a stoic demonstration of his tight control over China’s political apparatus.\n \n\n   \n  Not all Chinese leaders projected such a tightly constructed image.\n \n\n   \n  Xi’s predecessor Jiang Zemin, who served as president between 1993 and 2003, was known for his flamboyant personality, cosmopolitan flair and willingness to show off his language skills and interact with journalists.\n \n\n   \n  However, Xi has charted a different course. Along with curbing freedom of expression in China, he has maintained strict control of his image and the flow of information. Elite politics has become so opaque under his rule that pundits look for any clue for China’s direction – from parsing Xi’s words for their real meaning to assessing the  color of his hair. \n \n\n   \n  Xi’s more relaxed international appearances in South Korea barely made it to China’s tightly controlled internet. Censors often remove any coverage of Xi that deviates from the official narrative in the country, where most Western news websites and social media platforms are banned.\n \n\n   \n  Footage and images showing Xi’s light-hearted exchanges with his US and South Korean counterparts were nowhere to be found on two of the country’s most popular social media platforms: Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, and Xiaohongshu.\n \n\n   \n  A few posts by Chinese-language news outlets based outside of China that reported Xi’s gift exchange with South Korea’s Lee were available on X-like platform Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  The posts only displayed a few users’ comments despite hundreds of messages. Among the reactions that survived, one user posted a thumbs up emoji and another left a smiling face.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:15:00-05:00","title":"Millions of Americans Facing Delays in SNAP Food Assistance Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the government shutdown in November 2025, the Trump administration has agreed to use emergency funds to partially subsidize SNAP food benefits, with recipients receiving only half their usual allotment and facing significant delays in receiving aid.

November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s  Election Day 2025 . And the results in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere Tuesday could be some of the most significant dominoes to fall in the federal government shutdown, which is set to become the longest in history on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But the election isn’t the only X factor in the monthlong shutdown that’s evolving even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s check in on a number of key variables and sources of potential leverage in the shutdown and how they’re playing.\n \n\n   \n    Election Day 2025\n \n\n   \n  The big ones to watch here are the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  (The New York City mayor’s race and a redistricting ballot measure in California are fascinating for other reasons, but less instructive when it comes to Republican vs. Democrat power dynamics.)\n \n\n   \n  The blue lean of these two states and the history of these races suggest Democrats should win both gubernatorial races. Generally speaking, the party that just lost the presidential race  tends to overperform . This year, that’s Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win each race by comfortable margins — say by double digits — they’ll probably feel pretty good about how they’ve handled the shutdown. A good election night might leave them emboldened to press forward.\n \n\n   \n  That could especially be the case if Rep. Abigail Spanberger wins big in Virginia, given it’s home to so many government employees who are feeling the brunt of the shutdown. (The most recent polls suggest Spanberger leads, on average, by around 10 points.)\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans have been optimistic about making it a competitive race in New Jersey, which swung significantly in President Donald Trump’s direction in 2024. If Republican Jack Ciattarelli can keep it close with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Democrats might start second-guessing their shutdown strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans also appear to have real hope of winning the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race and especially the state’s attorney general’s race — though the latter owes mostly to the Democratic candidate’s  violent texts .\n \n\n   \n    Obamacare open enrollment\n \n\n   \n  This is the big source of potential leverage for Democrats. But it’s too early to say how it’s playing.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment for millions of people who get their health insurance  through the Obamacare marketplaces  began on Saturday. In other words, that’s when many people began to see their premiums would double next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies that would prevent those huge premium increases, in exchange for funding the government. And the optimistic case for them is that people seeing these premiums about to rise would ratchet up pressure on Republicans to give in.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republicans, including  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio , have warned the GOP about the political cost of not extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  We know that  north of 70% of Americans  have said they support extending the subsidies. The question for Republicans now is whether they think they might have to extend the subsidies either during or after the shutdown. If they start getting more pressure from their constituents, that could force them to act.\n \n\n   \n    SNAP benefits\n \n\n   \n  These food stamp benefits have been in limbo since Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration signaled Monday that it would  provide partial benefits  — $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund — after a federal judge ordered it to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  But notably, the administration declined to attempt to provide full benefits, which would cost roughly $9 billion for the month. And it made clear that it wasn’t going to strain too hard on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have been clear that they believe these benefits being withheld provides leverage in the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson last week told CNN’s Dana Bash that passing a bill to fully fund SNAP benefits would “reduce the pressure” on Democrats to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  So is he right?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps these benefits not being paid in full and on time does provide leverage — in the sense that no one wants to be blamed for Americans going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  But from a partisan standpoint, polls continue to show  more Americans blame Republicans than Democrats  for the shutdown. And the Republicans’ handling of SNAP in recent days could signal to Americans that it’s they who have stood in the way of a fully funded program.\n \n\n   \n  After all, Johnson was rejecting a push from some in his own party, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, to pass legislation.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday called the Trump administration’s partial SNAP funding “an intentional decision not to pay full benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the White House has also risked seeming tone-deaf on the financial pain of the shutdown in recent weeks. Not only has it set about demolishing the East Wing  for a ballroom  costing hundreds of millions of dollars (which Trump says is privately funded), but the president late last week proudly promoted a renovation of the  Lincoln Bedroom bathroom . And on Friday night, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort played host to  a “Great Gatsby”-themed event .\n \n\n   \n  Those are perhaps not the best optics.\n \n\n   \n    Paying the troops\n \n\n   \n  While the administration hasn’t bent over backward on SNAP benefits, it’s taken a more urgent posture toward military paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  For the second time, the administration on Friday  found funding  to make sure the military paychecks went out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made clear that he would like to be perceived as a political ally of the troops. He has repeatedly  attacked Democrats in speeches to the military  in recent weeks — a highly questionable breach of norms.\n \n\n   \n  “I want you to know that despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump told members of the Navy last month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have expressed warnings about Trump trying to wield the military for political purposes. And at some point, they might worry that enabling him to look like the savior of troops’ paychecks plays into his hands.\n \n\n   \n    Air travel\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps the biggest X factor right now. But it’s really difficult to evaluate the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n  This weekend marked the  worst one for air traffic control staffing shortages  since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis. And that notably came just days after Federal Aviation Administration employees  missed their first full paycheck .\n \n\n   \n  There have now been more than 400 staffing shortages, as of Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, meanwhile,  told CNBC  on Monday that he would “shut the whole airspace down” if he felt travel was unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that we are seeing significant slowdown in air travel probably plays somewhat like the SNAP issue — generally applying pressure on lawmakers to come to a resolution but not necessarily providing one side significantly more leverage than the other.\n \n\n   \n  The Thanksgiving travel season could up that pressure, however, as travel delays become more acute.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-cuomo-new-york-mayor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"Trump Urges New Yorkers to Vote for Cuomo for Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump urged New Yorkers to vote for former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 New York City mayoral election, describing him as capable and criticizing Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani as a threat.

Alejandra Jaramillo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:06 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump urged New Yorkers in his strongest terms yet to vote for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the city’s mayoral race on the eve of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,” the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday, adding that Cuomo “is capable of it” and that Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “is not!”\n \n\n   \n  His backing of Cuomo, whom he described as having a “Record of Success,” could hurt the former governor with Democrats as much as it helps him with Republicans in deep-blue New York City. Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, has repeatedly tied the former governor to Trump and argued that he would stand up to powerful interests in both New York and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo on Monday dismissed Trump’s endorsement, insisting that the president was simply opposing Mamdani. “He’s not endorsing me. He’s opposing Mamdani,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native, has long complained about Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, and falsely labeled him a communist. He again vowed to pull federal funds from the city if Mamdani wins Tuesday “other than the very minimum as required.”\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday night that the president is threatened by his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Like his (campaign), we’ve diagnosed the crisis in working class New Yorkers’ lives, the cost of living. But unlike him, we’re actually going to deliver on that. And that is a contrast that he can’t bear to see,” Mamdani said on “OutFront.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani had reacted to Trump’s backing of Cuomo earlier Monday at a canvas event in his Assembly district in Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him. Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  The president previously offered tepid support for Cuomo, casting the election as a choice between the better of two bad options, while discounting the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani quickly seized on Trump’s comments in that interview, posting his congratulations to Cuomo on X on Sunday and adding, “I know how hard you worked for this.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican president discouraged voters from backing Sliwa, though he’s stopped short of explicitly demanding the Republican nominee leave the race as other Cuomo backers have.\n \n\n   \n  “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys of likely voters have been  largely consistent i n showing Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, with Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally, also endorsed Cuomo on Monday over Mamdani and Sliwa. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he purchased in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has  a long history  with Trump dating back to his time as governor prior to his 2021 resignation facing sexual harassment allegations that he’s denied. The two tussled during the Covid-19 pandemic with often-dueling press briefings. But the former New York governor has presented his dealings with Trump as a plus for New York City, arguing that Mamdani is too inexperienced to handle the president.\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani retorted  during one debate . “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  The president — who’s holding telerallies for Virginia and New Jersey audiences Monday night — had his focus trained on the Empire State on social media, lashing out at Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who campaigned with Mamdani over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  He accused her of “killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL” and said he’d ask Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy “to take a good, long look at terminating New York City Congestion Pricing.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino, Aditi Sangal and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/japan-expensive-rice-kinmemai-premium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"From hunger to luxury: The story behind the world’s most expensive rice","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kinmemai Premium, a rare and luxury rice variety developed by Toyo Rice Corporation under the leadership of 91-year-old Keiji Saika, was officially recognized in 2016 as the world’s most expensive rice by Guinness World Records.

Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:49 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Holding an elegant black box embossed with the words “World’s Best Rice” in gold, Japanese chef Kenichi Fujimoto tilts his head and smiles — a flicker of skepticism on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “These things are often very commercial and not necessarily good,” says the Hong Kong-based chef/owner of Sushi Fujimoto, gesturing at the pot of rice simmering in his kitchen.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20 years of experience working under Michelin-starred sushi masters, the chef has encountered countless varieties of rice. Nothing like this, though.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do the makers of Kinmemai Premium claim that it’s the world’s best rice, but in 2016 Guinness World Records certified it as the  most expensive .\n \n\n   \n  Does it live up to the claim? CNN drafted in Fujimoto to help answer that question. The grains have been rinsed and soaked before they’re placed inside a cast-iron pot of water and heated.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an important test for a Japanese chef. “Rice is Japan’s soul food,” says Fujimoto. “For sushi, rice is the most important part — 80% of good sushi comes from the rice and 20% from the fish,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  The clock is now counting down to the moment of truth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll know in 15 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n    Only 1,000 boxes produced each year\n \n\n   \n  Rice has been a sacred staple in Japan for around 3,000 years.\n \n\n   \n  Today, there are more than 300 varieties commonly cultivated around the country, with new varieties constantly under development.\n \n\n   \n  Dishes and beverages made with Japanese rice — sushi, mochi cakes and sake — have gained international fame in recent decades. Rice exports, however, have never achieved the same levels of success.\n \n\n   \n  Enter Keiji Saika, the now 91-year-old president of Toyo Rice Corporation. In 2016, he decided to take promotion of the staple into his own hands.\n \n\n   \n  Based in Wakayama, his company sells rice milling machines as well as Kinmemai, directly translated as “Golden Sprout Rice”, a variety prized for its nutritional value and taste.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that Japan needed to better appeal to the international community about how great Japanese rice is,” Saika tells CNN Travel in an interview at the company’s Tokyo office.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge? Boost the global profile of Japanese rice without blowing the company’s marketing budget.\n \n\n   \n  “That was when the idea of Guinness World Records came to me. We’d have to do something that’s never been done before,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Confident that he had produced the world’s most delicious rice, Saika introduced Kinmemai Premium to the market that same year, selling it for a whopping 9,496 Japanese yen for a box of 840 grams — or about $109 per kilogram in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  “At a time when typical rice cost only 300 yen to 400 yen per kilogram, I wondered if anyone would actually buy it. Surprisingly, enquiries started increasing,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  What began as a one-off has since become an annual release, thanks to unrelenting demand. This year, boxes of Kinmemai Premium hit the market for 10,800 yen, or $73.4 apiece.\n \n\n   \n  With only 1,000 produced, they sold out quickly after their August 22 launch.\n \n\n   \n    Why doesn’t it make money?\n \n\n   \n  As Toyo Rice prepares to mark the project’s 10th anniversary in 2026, Saika emphasizes that profiting from the expensive rice was never his plan.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, when you calculate the costs, we’re probably running at a loss. Even though we sell it at a high price, it’s not profitable,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the initiative was meant to raise the profile of Japanese rice and encourage farmers to cultivate higher-quality strains. Saika calls it the “World’s Best Rice” project — one of many innovations driven by his determination to improve Japanese rice production.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1970s he developed rinse-free rice to conserve water. Two decades ago, his company created a new milling machine that removes only nine layers of bran instead of the usual 16, preserving nutrients and flavors.\n \n\n   \n  But to create Kinmemai Premium, the Guinness World Record version, the process is more complicated.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, Saika selects four to six top-class, award-winning rice varieties from a pool of about 5,000 entries. The International Contest on Rice Taste Evaluation, hosted by the Syokumi Kanteisi — The Rice Taste Appraiser Association — is the largest of its kind in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond flavor and texture, Saika tests the enzyme levels of each variety of rice.\n \n\n   \n  “That vitality, that life force, can be clearly identified through enzyme activity. Rice with strong vitality like that becomes truly exceptional,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Only the grains with the highest vitality are chosen. Then comes aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Letting the rice sit for a few months enhances the flavor even more. The taste becomes richer, and the health benefits seem to improve as well. So this rice is truly special,” Saika says.\n \n\n   \n  The painstaking process, combined with limited supply, makes Kinmemai Premium costly to produce. The rice is often given as a luxury gift, used to mark special occasions or impress corporate clients.\n \n\n   \n  Farmers chosen for the year’s  “World’s Best Rice” project are flown to Tokyo for the grand reveal.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone seems to take great pride in it,” says Saika. “This was an unexpected effect, but rice producers work hard toward that goal every year. As when they do that, it gets featured prominently in the local newspapers with a note that it’s been ‘selected as an ingredient for the World’s Best Rice.’”\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Kinmemai Premium features a blend of four rice varieties: there are two styles of Koshihikari Rice, from Gifu and Nagano prefectures, respectively, and two types of Yudai 21 Rice – also from Gifu and Nagano.\n \n\n   \n    Driven by hunger\n \n\n   \n  Saika’s devotion to rice is connected in his childhood. After World War II ended in 1945, Japan faced severe food shortages.\n \n\n   \n  The country was depending on the fall harvest to ease the crisis, but Typhoon Makurazaki hit Kagoshima, the southwestern tip of Japan, before moving north, devastating farmlands.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people died of starvation. Even judges — and those in important positions and the upper class,” Saika recalls.\n \n\n   \n  His family survived by planting whatever seeds they could find and catching eels, catfish and birds. This experience instilled in him a profound appreciation for rice and a mission to produce better grains.\n \n\n   \n  For him, Kinmemai Premium embodies that passion. But even he doesn’t have an unlimited supply.\n \n\n   \n  “(I eat it) just once a year when they ask me to taste that year’s rice. Just a little bit,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Hiroshi Matsumoto, head chef at the company’s in-house sushi restaurant, says he became an instant fan after trying the rice for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember it was so delicious that one bowl just wasn’t enough, and I found myself wanting a second one.” Still, he doesn’t serve it with sushi. “It’s best served warm, part of a set meal,” he says.\n \n\n   \n    Independent taste tests\n \n\n   \n  Back in Fujimoto’s kitchen the Kinmemai Premium — a gift from Toyo Rice — has been cooked and now sits steaming in the black, cast-iron pot.\n \n\n   \n  Usually, the chef would perform several test runs with a new rice to figure out the best soaking times, water levels and cooking temperatures. But with only 420 grams of Kinmemai Premium to play with, he’s had to improvise.\n \n\n   \n  Fujimoto rinsed the rice for a mere second and soaked it for 30 minutes — 30 minutes less than the recommended time — before adding it to the pot.\n \n\n   \n  His initial assessment? “Nice, clear color. I like it.” His wife Ai’s take? “Whoa. Shiny.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like a diamond,” adds Fujimoto. “You can see every grain standing out, which usually indicates good quality. The shape is beautiful, and the aroma is nicely balanced — not too strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tasting it, he gives his approval.\n \n\n   \n  “The flavor is well-balanced. The texture is good. It has nice moisture. This rice will appeal to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  Is he tempted to buy the rice for his restaurant?\n \n\n   \n  “No, no, no. It’s too expensive — we’d have to triple our prices,” he laughs.\n \n\n   \n  Like Toyo’s in-house chef, he also believes the rice is better served plain, more suited to a  kaiseki  restaurant, an establishment serving traditional refined dishes. “I think this rice isn’t really suited for sushi. It might get mushy if mixed with vinegar,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Chef Nansen Lai owns several Hong Kong restaurants including Flower Drum and Lai’s Kitchen – the latter of which specializes in clay pot rice. He also sampled the Kinmemai Premium, comparing it with his house blend — a mix of Thai fragrant rice and Koshihikari, another high-quality grain, from Japan’s Niigata prefecture.\n \n\n   \n  “It looks stickier and doesn’t have as strong a rice fragrance as Thai rice, which is a normal difference between Thai and Japanese rice,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  He takes a bite.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s delicious, with a much more complex taste and flavor than our house rice,” says Lai, before inviting his staff to try it.\n \n\n   \n  “From a restaurateur’s perspective, we can’t afford rice like this. We also need a firmer rice, like Thai rice, that can stand up to stronger sauces. But this rice is so tasty you could eat it plain.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Lai and Fujimoto agree that Toyo Rice’s project is a useful way to motivate producers.\n \n\n   \n  “Rice farmers are struggling. With costs like machines and gas prices rising, rice prices haven’t really changed much for the last 30 or 40 years. Japanese farmers didn’t enjoy the benefit of the raised retail prices. If they can’t make a living, young people will not continue the family business,” says Fujimoto.\n \n\n   \n    For a better future\n \n\n   \n  At 91, Saika remains vigorous, still going to work every day.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I’m wearing a suit, but usually I’m in work clothes, doing various tasks in the factory,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “There are quite a lot of elderly people who stay healthy. (Most) go to karaoke, play golf, or do exercises, but not many come to a company.”\n \n\n   \n  The secret to his health? Rice, of course. His passion for the staple drives him to keep working.\n \n\n   \n  “At this age, I care about the development of myself and the company, but my biggest concern is Japan’s future,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how many more years I’ll live, but during that time, I want to develop things that will be useful to society. I don’t have much time, so I’m busy every day.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"What to know about today’s key races, from NYC’s mayoral race to history in the making in Virginia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article outlines a series of key U.S. state elections occurring on November 4, 2025, including New York City’s mayoral race, New Jersey’s governorship, Virginia’s governorship, and a redistricting vote in California.

What to know about today’s key races, from NYC’s mayoral race to history in the making in Virginia \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to New York’s City Hall early Monday morning holding a banner that seemed to answer the president who has opposed him and the portions of the Democratic Party that have been slow to embrace him. “Our time is now,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani faces former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is attempting a political comeback as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the  mayoral race  — one of a handful of contests around the country Tuesday that will draw copious attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When the sun comes up, everything changes — shadows lift off the river, light reflects off of office building windows, and you start to feel the warmth of a new day. That was how it felt when we beat Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani said Monday morning, referring to his Democratic primary win. “And it’s how we will feel again tomorrow when polls close at 9 p.m. (ET).”\n \n\n   \n  Though New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, the outcome could offer a window into what the party’s voters want from their leaders as a slew of competitive House and Senate primaries approach, and the 2028 presidential primary starts to take shape. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim immigrant and democratic socialist, has faced resistance and reticence within his own party, including from congressional leaders, over his  views about Israel . But his relentless focus on the cost of living and his viral social media videos have also shot him to stardom — making him a unique figure in a party desperate for new ways to counter President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Monday said Cuomo is “Trump’s puppet in this race,” after Trump on Sunday called Mamdani a communist and threatened to withhold federal dollars from the city. Trump on Monday urged New Yorkers in his strongest terms yet to  vote for Cuomo , writing on Truth Social that voters “really have no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  The race for governor across the Hudson River in New Jersey, another one in Virginia and a key redistricting vote in California will also serve to gauge how voters feel in the first year of Trump’s second presidency – and provide signals about the midterm elections just one year away.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the ongoing shutdown and Trump’s efforts to remake the government have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers who will play a central role Tuesday. In New Jersey, the  durability of Latino voters’ swing  to Trump in 2024, and the political potency of affordability concerns fueled by increasing taxes and utility costs, are at the center of a competitive contest.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas and a state Supreme Court retention vote in Pennsylvania cap an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are largely rallying around Cuomo, identifying him as the only hope of stopping Mamdani’s election despite Sliwa’s presence in the race. Trump said on “60 Minutes” Sunday that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time to be honest with you.”\n \n\n   \n  Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who served a short stint in Trump’s White House,  urged New Yorkers on X  on Monday to vote for Cuomo. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be a continued fight against Trump’s vision in Washington as he tries to stifle opportunity for people across this country,” Sherrill told supporters at a campaign office visit Monday.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday by CNN whether Trump is a liability in the governor’s race, Ciattarelli said, “Not one bit.”\n \n\n   \n  “The people of New Jersey know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day of the week,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  “What is it that we do here in Virginia?” Spanberger said at a Monday rally. “The answer is, we flip some seats. … The answer is that we stand up against the chaos and the division that we see coming out of this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races in Virginia four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana set to convene a special legislative session in the coming weeks to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/jake-haro-son-killing-trial-sentencing-california","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"California father who killed his 7-month-old son sentenced to more than 30 years in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old father, Jake Haro, from Cabazon, California, was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to the second-degree murder of his 7-month-old son, Emmanuel, and for prior child endangerment involving a 10-month-old daughter.

PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Firefighters late Monday finally managed to extract a worker from beneath rubble inside a medieval tower that partially collapsed during renovation work in the heart of  Italy’s capital , but the joy of that rescue proved short-lived.\n \n\n   \n  The man didn’t withstand the trauma he suffered and died soon thereafter.\n \n\n   \n  “I express deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss of Octay Stroici, the worker who was killed in the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome,” Italy’s  Premier Giorgia Meloni  said in a statement after midnight. “We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering.”\n \n\n   \n  Images broadcast on local television had shown a trio of rescuers loading the man onto a telescopic aerial ladder, then descending and wheeling him on a stretcher into an ambulance. His state wasn’t immediately clear, but Adriano De Acutis, chief commander of Rome’s firefighters, said on state television channel RAI that he was conscious.\n \n\n   \n  “Since the conditions seem serious, they will now evaluate him and he was immediately taken to the hospital,” Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use a first-floor window to get near the trapped worker. But they were forced to retreat in a cloud of debris as the structure continued to give way. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.\n \n\n   \n  As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.\n \n\n   \n  “The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed there was additional rubble that covered it,” Giannini said.\n \n\n   \n  Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri had told reporters earlier that the worker was speaking to rescuers and using an oxygen mask. He added that rescuers were working with extreme caution in “a very delicate extraction operation” to avoid further collapses.\n \n\n   \n  Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition; RAI reported he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.\n \n\n   \n  No firefighters were injured in the ensuing operation.\n \n\n   \n  The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of tourists had gathered to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure crumbled, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend.\n \n\n   \n  The first collapse struck the central buttress of the structure’s southern side, and caused an underlying sloped base to fall. The second damaged part of the stairwell and roof, cultural heritage officials said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Queen Paglinawan, 27, was attending to a client in a gelato parlor next door when the tower first started coming apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,″ Paglinawan told The Associated Press as yet more rubble crashed down.\n \n\n   \n  The tower, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8 million) restoration, that includes conservations work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out “to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary” to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said. The current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.\n \n\n   \n  Italian prosecutors arrived at the scene as the rescue operation was underway, and were investigating possible charges for negligent disaster and negligent injuries, Italian media reported. It is common in Italy for investigations to begin while an event is ongoing and before possible suspects are identified.\n \n\n   \n  German student Viktoria Braeu had just finished a tour at the nearby Colosseum and was passing by the scene during the firefighters’ initial rescue attempt.\n \n\n   \n  “And then we were like, ‘It’s probably not long until it’s going to go down,’ and then it just started erupting,” said Braeu, 18.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Meloni had shared her hopes for a successful rescue.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life under the rubble and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy will have a positive outcome,” Meloni said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to thank all the law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers who are intervening with courage, professionalism, and dedication in this extremely difficult situation.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-nigeria-military-action-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens Military Action in Nigeria Over Christian Persecution","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, while watching a Fox News segment on Christian persecution in Nigeria by radical Islamic groups, became immediately alarmed and took swift action.

Within an hour, he was laser-focused on Christians’ treatment in Nigeria \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was heading to Florida on Friday, watching Fox News, when he saw the network run a story on how Christians were being targeted by Islamic groups in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president was “immediately” angered by it, one of the sources said, and asked to get further read in on the issue. Shortly after Air Force One touched down in West Palm Beach, he began posting on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” he posted, adding that he is making Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the president has “been tracking this issue previously and had already begun thinking about Truthing it out.”\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plight of Christians in Nigeria became a focal point of Trump’s  throughout the weekend , leading him to call directly on his secretary of defense to “prepare for possible action” and warn the US would enter Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to protect the Christian population of Africa’s most populous country.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources familiar with Trump’s thinking on the issue told CNN that the president’s threats toward the country are meant to “see how Nigeria responds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an ‘Art of the Deal’”-type strategy, the source said. And a key part of it has already been met with the intended effect: The actions by Islamist groups are gaining attention thanks to his posts, they argued.\n \n\n   \n  “At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CNN. “Any announcements will come from the President directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The plight of Nigeria’s Christians has been an animating subject for American conservatives for years, with some of Trump’s top allies, including Sen. Ted Cruz, in recent months calling for US intervention after claiming Nigeria’s government wasn’t doing enough to prevent attacks on Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has denied the accusations, and both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s directive to the Pentagon to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria — including, in his telling, potential US boots on the ground — caught many by surprise, including in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Personnel within US Africa Command were abruptly recalled to headquarters over the weekend following Trump’s post on Saturday vowing potential military action in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The post left many wondering what the president wanted the military to do, the sources said. A small group of personnel with AFRICOM, which is based in Germany, were quickly recalled to discuss potential courses of action.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon was “preparing for action,” and one of the sources said there was a request from the Pentagon to build out various contingency plans.\n \n\n   \n  It remained unclear what the plans entail, though creating contingency plans for a range of scenarios to provide to the president and secretary of defense is one of the primary functions of the military.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump was elected in a landslide victory to accomplish his peace through strength agenda. The Department of War stands ready to execute the Commander in Chief’s direction,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The snap-to reaction on Saturday was indicative of a broader frustration with the way potential policy decisions are relayed over social media, one of the sources familiar said, with little planning done ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, declined to rule out sending American troops to Nigeria to protect Christians there.\n \n\n   \n  “Could be,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of US troops or airstrikes. “I envisage a lot of things. They’re killing a record number of Christians in Nigeria,” the president told reporters, saying other countries in Africa were doing similar.\n \n\n   \n    The reality on the ground\n \n\n   \n  While Trump claimed a “mass slaughter” of Christians was underway in Nigeria, there exists a  more nuanced reality  on the ground. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, experts and analysts say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to natural resources.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, Trump’s adviser on Arab and African affairs, told  Nigerian media  last month that “People of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Within US conservative circles, however, the situation in Nigeria has caused growing alarm. Trump himself raised the issue during a first-term meeting with then-President  Muhammadu Buhari  at the White House in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It’s a horrible story,” Trump said during a joint news conference afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Buhari said he had explained to Trump the security situation in Nigeria was more complicated than mere religious persecution, saying groups sometimes used religious violence as they pursued economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” two years later, citing “severe violations of religious freedom.” The Biden administration reversed the decision.\n \n\n   \n    Renewed effort by conservatives\n \n\n   \n  With Trump’s return to office came a renewed effort by American conservatives to apply pressure on the Nigerian government to stem violence against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who has earned overwhelming support from evangelical Christians during his campaigns for president, vowed during last year’s election to combat anti-Christian bias. And administration officials have stated previously that protecting Christians is a key tenet of Trump’s foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Paula White-Cain, the senior adviser to the White House faith office and Trump’s longtime spiritual adviser, has previously traveled to Nigeria to minister. She thanked Trump on social media this weekend for his “strong stand on Christian persecution in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, an evangelical Christian from Texas, is one of the GOP lawmakers who has been working to get his fellow Christians and Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedoms.\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill in September to sanction Nigerian officials whom he accused of “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians.” The measure would also require the State Department to redesignate Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” — something the president noted in his first post on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the issue was amplified on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO. Maher said Islamic militants in Nigeria were “attempting to wipe out the Christian population of an entire country.” HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.\n \n\n   \n  None of those calls seemed to go as far as Trump did, however, in threatening US military action on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How such an intervention is carried out remains to be seen. Last year, the US  completed a withdrawal  of some 1,000 US troops from Niger, which neighbors Nigeria, ending a longtime presence in the nation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nimi Princewill contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/north-korea-kim-yong-nam-death-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:38:00-05:00","title":"North Korea’s Longtime Ceremonial Head of State Kim Yong Nam Dies at 97","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kim Yong Nam, the long-serving ceremonial head of state in North Korea, has died at the age of 97, according to state media.

Korea’s longtime ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam has died, Pyongyang says \n       \n  Story by the Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:38 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Kim Yong Nam, a quintessential North Korean bureaucrat whose lifelong loyalty to the ruling Kim dynasty allowed him to serve as the country’s ceremonial head of state for two decades, has died, state media reported Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday that Kim Yong Nam, former president of the Presidium of  North Korea ’s rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly, died Monday of multiple organ failure at the age of 97.\n \n\n   \n  KCNA said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the bier of Kim Yong Nam on Tuesday to express deep condolences over his death. It said Kim Yong Nam’s funeral was set for Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam is not related to Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule North Korea. Kim Jong Un, grandson of state founder Kim Il Sung, took power upon his father Kim Jong Il’s death in 2011 in the country’s second hereditary power transfer.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam served as head of the Supreme People’s Assembly from 1998 to April 2019. That post is North Korea’s nominal head of state, though the true power was held by the Kim family that has ruled the North since its formal foundation in 1948.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam, who was known for propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice at key state events, often appeared in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  In February 2018, he traveled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics as Pyongyang sought better ties with Seoul and Washington after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  The trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since Kim Jong Un sent a top military officer to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pyeongchang opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-US Vice President Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s temporary diplomatic openness peaked with the summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, but Kim Yong Nam did not attend them and his influence was seen as waning due to his age.

He joined the ruling Workers’ Party shortly after the 1950-53 Korean War and survived major political purges through the 1970s. He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. During his tenure, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaving North Korea isolated.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea watchers also say Kim Yong Nam had an expertise in third-world diplomacy. He was a frequent participant in gatherings of nations that consider themselves independent from major power blocs, including the 2012 Non-Aligned Movement summit in Iran.\n \n\n   \n  People who met Kim Yong Nam described him as mild-mannered but staunch in his opinions.\n \n\n   \n  “I found Kim Yong Nam a puzzling figure. In greetings before business began, he was cordial and relaxed, but once at work, he relentlessly followed his script in a way that reminded of former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko,” former Washington Post reporter Don Oberdofer wrote in his book, “The Two Koreas.”\n \n\n   \n  In a testament to his loyalty to the ruling dynasty, Kim Yong Nam read an elegy to Kim Il Sung when he died in 1994. Kim Yong Nam also undertook the job of formally nominating Kim Jong Il to be chairman of the National Defense Commission after the son observed a three-year mourning period.\n \n\n   \n  A native of Pyongyang, Kim Yong Nam studied at Kim Il Sung University and Moscow State University.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/jury-selection-sandwich-thrower-cbp-agent","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:47:00-05:00","title":"DC Jurors Dismissed in Trial of Man Charged with Throwing Sandwich at Federal Agent Are Deeply Skeptical of the Case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the trial of Sean Dunn, who is accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer, potential jurors expressed deep skepticism about whether a jury in Washington, D.C. would convict him, questioning whether the act constitutes a true assault.

Words like that carry generations of pain, and pretending otherwise only keeps the cycle going. Defending it, laughing about it, or making excuses is even worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Carthen encouraged her followers “to donate to organizations dedicated to educating and uplifting the Black community like UNCF, NAACP and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not the first time that Mustafa and Carthen have faced off regarding racism.\n \n\n   \n  During the reunion show which aired in August, Carthen took Mustafa to task for not better addressing Mustafa’s followers who had been racist towards Carthen.\n \n\n   \n  A rep for Mustafa told CNN via email on Monday, “We are deeply disappointed by the decision and are happy with the impact the campaign had.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Russell and Carthen for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “Love Island USA” is a spinoff of the popular UK series which seeks to link couples up to find love.

Banks died of complications from renal neoplasm, or kidney cancer, said Montgomery County Coroner Dr. Janine Darby.\n \n\n   \n  Banks had been in prison since 1982 after shooting 14 people, and killing 13, including his own children, during a rampage in Wilkes-Barre. At time, it was considered one of the worst mass murders in American history. He was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and one count of third-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n  Banks had been drinking at a party late at night before using an AR-15 rifle to start the rampage at his home.\n \n\n   \n  Five victims were his children, ages 1 to 6. Four more were the mothers of his children. Other victims were bystanders, including an 11-year-old child who sometimes stayed with his family, a 7-year-old child and a teenager who saw Banks leaving his home armed with the rifle and recognized him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks killed three women and five children at his home, authorities say. Then, dressed in green army fatigues with an ammunition bandolier around his chest and shoulders, Banks left, when he saw four teenagers walking to their car from a nearby friend’s house. He shot one fatally, and another, who survived, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  He stole a car and went to the Heather Highlands Trailer Park where police found the bodies of Banks’ son and the child’s mother, as well as her mother and her nephew.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Banks went to his mother’s house, who told police that Banks told her, “I killed them. I killed them all,” court records say.\n \n\n   \n  Banks eventually surrendered after a four-hour standoff at a friend’s house after police tried to convince him that his victims had survived.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, state courts prevented his execution, saying he wasn’t mentally competent. That left Banks with a sentence of life imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager who survived being shot by Banks, Jim Olson, later expressed frustration in 2012 that Banks hadn’t been executed, saying, “What is the sense of having a death penalty if you don’t use it or enforce it?″\n \n\n   \n  Defense lawyers had argued that Banks was insane when he went on the shooting spree.\n \n\n   \n  After his arrest, Banks, who is biracial, claimed he had killed his children to save them from the pain of growing up in a racist society. During his trial, he overruled his lawyer on strategic decisions, and argued instead that prosecutors, the judge and the mayor of Wilkes-Barre were conspiring against him.\n \n\n   \n  Banks also showed the jury gory pictures of his victims, even after his lawyer had successfully gotten the photos barred on the grounds that they were gruesome and prejudicial.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/kimberly-clark-kenvue-acquisition","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:09:00.000Z","title":"Tylenol’s Parent Company to Merge with Huggies Maker in $48.7 Billion Deal","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kimberly-Clark has announced a $48.7 billion acquisition of Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, creating one of the largest consumer products conglomerates in history.

$48.7 billion mega-deal \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:09 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark announced Monday it will buy Tylenol’s parent company Kenvue in a nearly $50 billion deal, creating a massive consumer products conglomerate.\n \n\n   \n  The merger is the latest in a recent dealmaking explosion, signaling the Trump administration’s openness toward corporate acquisitions. But it also represents a gamble that one of Kenvue’s signature products will be able to withstand increased scrutiny.\n \n\n   \n  The acquisition comes a few weeks after President Donald Trump made  unfounded claims  linking autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy, sending Kenvue’s stock sharply lower. The company has  staunchly pushed back  against his administration’s accusations.\n \n\n   \n  The companies said that the combined business will bring together 10 billion-dollar brands and will drive annual revenue of $32 billion. The new company will make products that “touch nearly half the global population through every stage of life,” including Johnson’s baby products, Clean & Clear skin care, Kleenex, Listerine mouthwash, and Depends adult diapers, the companies said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n   Kenvue was spun off in 2022  from Johnson & Johnson, with J&J keeping its recognizable name for its larger pharmaceutical business unit and offloading its consumer brands. It was widely expected to be an acquisition target.\n \n\n   \n  The transaction is scheduled to close in the second half of next year. Following the closing, Kimberly-Clark shareholders will own about 54% of the newly combined company, with Kenvue shareholders owning the rest.\n \n\n   \n    A risky bet\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes with some considerable risks.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Kenvue reported an overall sales decline of 4.4%, as well as its its self care unit, which includes Tylenol, falling 5.3% for the quarter ending on September 28.\n \n\n   \n  The company explained that the sales declines were the result of “trade inventory reductions in certain customers,” likely that from cash-strapped customers trading down to cheaper, private labels that offer similar quality — perhaps a warning a sign to the new company that’s betting on a lineup of name-brand companies.\n \n\n   \n  And Kenvue faces potentially intense legal scrutiny over the Trump administration’s claims. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  filed a lawsuit against Kenvue , claiming that the company “deceptively” marketed Tylenol to pregnant women and that the medication is tied to an increased risk of autism. Kenvue said it will “vigorously defend” against the claims.\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu addressed the Tylenol issue on a call with analysts Monday, saying its “board carefully considered all the risks and all the opportunities” and had multiple meetings with “medical, regulatory and legal experts” and decided that the deal is a “generational value creation opportunity for both companies.”\n \n\n   \n  “We stand firmly behind the science and the safety of our products,” added Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry. “These things have been studied for decades, and we continue to stand by that science as the medical community does as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The cash-and-stock deal has Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ) paying $21.01 for each Kenvue ( KVUE ) share, a hefty premium over the $14.37 of its Friday closing price.\n \n\n   \n  But the premium is only slightly higher than the $17 a share Kenvue’s stock was trading for just before Trump held his “don’t take Tylenol” news conference on September 22. And it’s only a hair above the $20 stock price right before the first news reports suggested that the Trump administration may make a link between Tylenol and autism.\n \n\n   \n  Kenvue’s stock soared more than 16% Monday. Kimberly-Clark’s stock fell nearly 13%.\n \n\n   \n    An M&A explosion\n \n\n   \n  The deal comes as the deregulatory environment ushered in with the Trump administration has led to a rush of mergers and acquisitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Kenvue deal is the third-largest acquisition this year, according to mergers-and-acquisitions data provider Dealogic. The $72 billion deal between railroad companies  Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern  ranks first and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund  purchase  of video games maker Electronics Arts for $55 million places second.\n \n\n   \n  After deals cooled off considerably in the post-pandemic era, M&A appears to be back in a big way this year. So far, 2025 has produced $1.9 trillion in deals in the United States, up the highest since 2021, according to Dealogic. Excluding the pandemic-fueled M&A boom, 2025’s deals hold the highest collective value since 2015 and are on pace to surpass it.\n \n\n   \n  The Kimberly-Clark acquisition of Kenvue would be the fourth-largest consumer products deal of all time, behind only Altria’s $111 billion spin-off of Philip Morris International in 2008, British American Tobacco’s 2015 purchase of Reynolds American for $64 billion, and P&G’s 2005 Gillette acquisition for $61 billion.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/government-shutdown-aviation-safety","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"18:41:00-05:00","title":"Is it safe to fly during the government shutdown?

I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, how do I pay my rent?”\n \n\n   \n  For over 34 days, the federal government has been shut down. For travelers, the shutdown has caused some TSA wait times and flight delays to skyrocket.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said, those delays are one way controllers are keeping passengers safe. Flights are slowed down so the employees who showed up to work can manage them.\n \n\n   \n  “Is there more risk in the system when you have a shutdown? Absolutely there’s more risk,” he said on CNBC Monday. “If we thought that it was unsafe… we’ll shut the whole airspace down. We won’t let people travel. We’re not there at this point. It’s just significant delays,”\n \n\n   \n    Compromising predictability\n \n\n   \n  For some, like Erik Hansen senior vice president of government relations at the US Travel Association, a shutdown compromises the reliability of air travel.\n \n\n   \n  “The challenge is that the system is never going to compromise safety, but we’re absolutely compromising predictability and the ability of Americans to get to where they want to go on time,” Hansen said.\n \n\n   \n  Shortages have been widespread across the country in places like Chicago, Denver, Houston and Newark causing ground delays and disrupting passengers.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers who aren’t able to focus on the job under these trying circumstances should call out sick, Mike McCormick an assistant professor of Air Traffic Management at Embry-Riddle University, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “If controllers were more reporting to work in such a condition that they could not be 100%, for their air traffic control duties, then, yes, that creates a risk of safety,” McCormick said. “From what I’m seeing across the system, controllers are recognizing their limitations, and they’re not reporting to work, so that is actually helping to keep the system safe.”\n \n\n   \n    Stressful jobs become even more stressful\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s Bush Intercontinental Airport is warning passengers it could take three hours to get though TSA checkpoints due to staffing shortages. Long lines snaked around the terminal Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Call-outs will continue to rise in TSA, because those frontline employees are forced with making those decisions,” said Keith Jeffries, vice president of K2 Security Screening Group and a former TSA federal security director at Los Angeles International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries believes it is still safe to fly but knows there’s going to be delays. He thinks the aviation transportation system will see a “domino effect,” as the turmoil of the shutdown lingers.\n \n\n   \n  “Flying is safe, but you know you’re going to have, certainly, front line employees, are they thinking about that next bill that is due, and they can’t afford to pay it? Or are they focused on looking for dangerous, prohibited items? You can make that argument,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Union leaders and most major airlines have said the answer is not complicated, Congress to end the shutdown so controllers and TSA workers can be paid.\n \n\n   \n  “Our message is simple, open the government, and it has to open now,” Daniels said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-social-media-james-comey-letitia-james","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00Z","title":"Justice Department defends Lindsey Halligan and Trump’s social media posts targeting James Comey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Justice Department has defended both the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney and the prosecution of James Comey and Letitia James, arguing that Trump’s social media posts do not indicate a vendetta against Comey for criticizing him, and that the appointment of Halligan is lawful under federal law.

defends Lindsey Halligan and Trump’s social media posts targeting James Comey \n       \n  By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn  Polantz, Devan Cole, Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:46 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s personal vendetta against James Comey did not lead to his indictment, the Justice Department said in a court filing Monday, urging a judge not to throw out the charges against the former FBI director over Trump’s extraordinary  social media post  calling for his prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  The claim arose as prosecutors try to undermine Comey’s key defense  — that he is being  “singled out” for prosecution  because he has criticized Trump — and dive further into battle between the Justice Department and Comey over whether the former FBI director was prosecuted simply because he is one of the president’s longtime foes.\n \n\n   \n  “The defendant spins a tale that requires leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism, then he calls the President’s post a direct admission,”  prosecutors wrote. \n \n\n   \n  “None of the President’s social-media posts express a desire for the defendant to be penalized for exercising his First Amendment rights. Far from it,” they continued. “The President’s social-media posts are clear on why he thinks the defendant should be prosecuted: he thinks the defendant is ‘guilty as hell.’”\n \n\n   \n  The crux of Comey’s argument is that Trump has made no secret of his vitriol for him during the president’s yearlong vendetta against the FBI for its investigation into Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has focused his animosity on Comey, his attorneys argued, citing an extraordinary list of public statements in which Trump called him a liar and suggested he should be investigated and prosecuted.\n \n\n   \n  But the “smoking-gun evidence,” defense attorneys said, was Trump’s  social media post  days before an indictment was handed up declaring Comey was “guilty as hell” and demanding of the Attorney General that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors rebuffed the argument, saying that Trump has long showed his belief that Comey should be criminally charged. In fact, they said, Trump had accused Comey of committing a crime even before the former director began publicly criticizing him.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s repeated posts suggest he “disfavors” Comey, prosecutors said, many of them also show that Trump believed Comey “leaked information” and “lie[d] under oath” – the same allegations that comprise the case against him. Therefore, they argued, it would take “contrived reading” of those posts to conclude Trump wanted Comey charged because of his criticism of the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Halligan’s appointment\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in a separate Monday filing  defended the legitimacy of the prosecutor  who Comey’s indictment, as well as the indictment of  New York Attorney General Letitia James . The department argued the Interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is lawfully serving in a role she was appointed to.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge is weighing bids by Comey and James to have their charges thrown out based on their claim that Halligan, who convinced federal grand juries to approve the charges against Comey and James, is not lawfully serving in the position.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan was tapped for the post after Trump pushed out the former interim US attorney, Erik Siebert. Both Comey and James claim Siebert had already served the legally allotted maximum of 120 days that someone can serve on a temporary basis before needing to be confirmed by the Senate and that Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not legally able to appoint a new interim attorney and avoid the Senate confirmation process.\n \n\n   \n  But in court papers submitted Monday, the Justice Department pushed back strongly on those assertions and told US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie that even if she were to conclude Halligan is not lawfully serving in her role, the two indictments should not be tossed out altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “Even were Ms. Halligan’s appointment invalid, the motions to dismiss should be denied. While Defendants challenge Ms. Halligan’s appointment as interim US Attorney, the actions they challenge do not hinge on her validly holding that particular office,” the Justice Department wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The government attorneys argue that federal law does not bar the attorney general from appointing a new interim US attorney after 120 days “if a new vacancy arises.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Attorney General must revisit her interim appointments every 120 days. They do not automatically renew,” they wrote. “At the same time, Congress did not hamstring the Attorney General with an artificial, one-time-only appointment window.”\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments over Halligan’s authority next week. Three other judges around the country have concluded that a trio of Trump’s choices for US attorney in other districts are serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  Should James and Comey succeed in persuading the judge that Halligan was unlawfully appointed, it could doom both cases since Halligan was the only prosecutor to sign the indictments.\n \n\n   \n    DOJ defends Letitia James subpoena\n \n\n   \n  In a separate filing, the Justice Department on Monday defended its subpoenas to James, the New York attorney general, seeking records relating to civil investigations into the Trump Organization and National Rifle Association.\n \n\n   \n  James had  moved to quash the subpoenas , which were issued in August, saying they are overly broad, infringe on state rights, and are invalid because they are signed by John Sarcone, the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, who they say is serving unlawfully.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department in its filing,  which was unsealed on Monday , said that motion should be denied.\n \n\n   \n  “Acting United States Attorney John A. Sarcone III’s status in that role is irrelevant. The grand jury can issue subpoenas, and AUSAs and special attorneys (like Mr. Sarcone) can conduct grand jury investigations, regardless of the status of the United States Attorney. In any event, Mr. Sarcone is validly serving as Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York,” prosecutors wrote.\n \n\n   \n  In support of its position, DOJ also points to a New York State appellate judge’s dissenting opinion in the civil fraud case. Trump did not raise the issue of selective prosecution in his appeal of the civil fraud case. But the judge wrote that James brought the lawsuit “out of partisan political motives.”\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers have said the investigation was launched after Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress alleging values for properties were manipulated.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ also wrote that the subpoena was sent to the office of the attorney general “no individual, including Attorney General James, have been identified as targets of the investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  James has pleaded not guilty to charges related to an investigation into alleged mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:24:00Z","title":"Will SNAP Benefits Be Paid in November?

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:24 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Food stamp recipients will  only get half  of their typical benefits in November, and for many, that assistance will likely be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture said in a court filing Monday that it will only tap into the program’s contingency fund, which doesn’t have enough money to cover enrollees’ full allotments during the government shutdown. The agency said it will not use an additional pot of money to make up the difference in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for  food stamps .\n \n\n   \n  The move came after a federal judge in Rhode Island  ordered  the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund. A second federal judge also ruled last week that the agency is required at least to use the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA’s unprecedented decision to halt food stamps benefits in November prompted  a coalition of Democratic-led states  and a group of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to sue last week.\n \n\n   \n  Both judges said it was up to the agency whether to tap into other money to enable it to provide the full allocation. The agency has opted to transfer $750 million in unused tariff revenue dedicated to child nutrition programs to support the  WIC nutrition assistance program  during the shutdown but said it can’t do the same for SNAP without endangering the free and reduced-price school meals and other programs.\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  The much-needed SNAP assistance won’t come that quickly for many food stamp recipients. Several procedural challenges must be overcome before the benefits can start flowing to the nearly 42 million people who receive food stamps. SNAP provides households with just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data.\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of  issuing benefits for November  after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has been felt immediately. Some 3 million recipients should have received their benefits on November 1, according to an estimate by Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs. The number grows to nearly 13.7 million by November 5, with remaining SNAP enrollees getting their allotments on a staggered basis during the month.\n \n\n   \n  “They are not going out on time,” Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, told CNN last week of the November benefits.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, providing partial payments is much more complicated — and time consuming.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA has never had to reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients before, according to a declaration filed Friday by the agency official who oversees the program. Also, state agencies will need to recode their systems to issue the smaller benefit amounts, which could result in errors.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” said Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of the USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services,  in a second declaration filed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  For at least some states, the process could take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, Penn said.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA will provide guidance on calculating the partial payments to states on Monday, Penn told the court.\n \n\n   \n  While some states have identified potential ways to issue smaller benefits quickly, the methods must be programmed, tested and verified, which could take time, Plata-Nino noted.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP enrollees who receive partial benefits in November will get retroactive payments to make them whole once the government reopens, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Providing full benefits would have been the fastest way to get assistance to food stamp recipients.\n \n\n   \n  “If the administration complies with the courts’ rulings to release the SNAP contingency funds immediately and supplements those amounts using its legal transfer authority, which the courts also affirmed, then SNAP benefits could begin to be issued with only a short delay,” Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told CNN last week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated following the Department of Agriculture’s announcement that it would pay partial SNAP benefits for November. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/politics/early-voting-elections-nyc-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:11:00Z","title":"What early voting data says about NYC, Virginia and New Jersey elections heading into Tuesday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Early voting data from New Jersey, New York City, and Virginia suggests a strengthening position for Democratic candidates heading into Election Day in November 2025.

Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Early voting data suggests that the  Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia  are heading into Election Day in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City,  Andrew Cuomo  may have emerged in a stronger position than in the primary. But a key part of  Zohran Mamdani’s base  also surged through early in-person voting.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.\n \n\n   \n  Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.\n \n\n   \n  Note: In all three locations, early in-person voting has concluded, while mail ballots can continue to arrive over the coming days.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Democrats turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters relative to 2024 in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year before Election Day. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at the equivalent point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also held a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.\n \n\n   \n  As of the end of early in-person voting on November 2, Democrats represented a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year. Registered Democrats led registered Republicans in total pre-election votes by 22 points, compared to a 16-point lead at this time last year, according to data from Catalist.\n \n\n   \n    New York City: Older voters turned out more; younger voters caught up\n \n\n   \n  Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters turned out more at the start of in-person early voting than in the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate got younger through the early voting period and is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections.\n \n\n   \n  The electorate is considerably younger than in past mayoral elections, and a CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections found that daily turnout among Democrats got younger over the course of early in-person voting: While older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the final day.\n \n\n   \n  Now, about 49% of registered Democratic early in-person voters (51% of all early in-person voters) are ages 50 and up, while 17% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (16% of voters overall).\n \n\n   \n  That’s roughly the same as the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18 to 29, according to data from L2.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s turnout is also far younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of Democratic votes was more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts cast 177% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts cast 132% of their early voting totals.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position\n \n\n   \n  While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into Election Day than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.\n \n\n   \n  The geographic distribution of early in-person votes and mail ballots is similar to what they were at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a slightly larger share of the pre-election vote this year (22%) than they did at this point last year (19%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.\n \n\n   \n  During early in-person voting, counties where Trump won last year averaged 62% of their in-person votes cast last year, while Harris-won counties finished at 60%. The worst performing counties were places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they finished at just 55% of the in-person votes they cast last year.\n \n\n   \n  Harris-won counties finished in-person early voting strongly, narrowing the gap from 10 points to 2 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as  Arlington  and  Fairfax .\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/01/us/nebraska-cornhusker-clink-ice-detention-center","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"05:37:00-05:00","title":"An undocumented mother says ICE raids and ‘Cornhusker Clink’ are the end of the Nebraska she’s called home for decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how the opening of the 'Cornhusker Clink' ICE detention center in Nebraska—despite the state's historically welcoming immigrant communities and rural reliance on immigrant labor in sectors like meatpacking—has led to widespread fear, economic disruption, and emotional trauma.

Jim Pillen told CNN Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The facility will join other new ICE detention centers in Republican-led states, including “ Alligator Alcatraz ” in Florida, “Louisiana Lockup” or  “Camp 57”  in Louisiana, and “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.\n \n\n   \n  These new ICE facilities “are significantly expanding detention space to house the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “We look forward to the opening of this new partnership with Nebraska very soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with DHS will bring around $14 million annually to the state. Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for the governor’s office described it as “the latest action undertaken by Gov. Pillen to stand with President Trump and protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens. The facility will not only serve Nebraska, but also other states in the region.”\n \n\n   \n  Sitting hundreds of miles away from the border, the opening of “Cornhusker Clink” may solidify Nebraska’s place in the national immigration debate. Unlike many states at the center of immigration enforcement operations, Nebraska is under full Republican control and its governor hasn’t shied away from the conversation.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen signed a  January executive order  expressing his support for federal immigration policy, ordered Nebraska National Guard deployments to Texas, and facilitated the  troops’ activation  ahead of recent ICE protests in his state. He also touted the alleged  arrest of a MS-13 “kingpin”  in Omaha this summer.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, immigration advocates, some state lawmakers and business leaders said it’s a contrast from the previously welcoming atmosphere they have worked to build in the state, especially to strengthen its economy.\n \n\n   \n    Nebraska’s immigrant workforce under threat\n \n\n   \n  Unlike other states, Nebraska is not often seen as a haven for immigrants, but parts of the state are an enclave for Latinos, who have lived and worked in the Cornhusker state for many years in part due to the meat packing industry, immigration advocates and business leaders in the state say.\n \n\n   \n  Today, much of Nebraska’s Latino population is second, third, or even fourth generation. In rural towns like Schuyler, Lexington and Madison, which some call “Latino Pueblos,” some business owners and community leaders were initially drawn by jobs at meat-packing plants and stayed for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Now, immigration operations are threatening the stability of these small communities and industry operations in Nebraska, said John Hansen, president of the  Nebraska Farmers Union .\n \n\n   \n  “There’s an awful lot of folks that are just afraid to show up to work, afraid to be seen in public,” said Hansen, noting many farms and meatpacking plants are struggling to stay staffed.\n \n\n   \n  Nebraska’s meatpacking industry, which includes major processing facilities for JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield, depends on immigrant labor. Immigrants, many of whom are undocumented, represent about 53% of the state’s workforce, according to the  Migration Policy Institute .\n \n\n   \n  Immigration raids, rising deportation fears and political shifts have created “an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” among workers, Hansen said, and some union members have privately expressed regret about voting for Trump, who won a majority of the state’s vote in the 2024 election, citing mass deportation and tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The state is experiencing a severe labor shortage, with only 70 available workers for every 100 open jobs as of August, according to data from the  US Chamber of Commerce .\n \n\n   \n  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly claimed  immigrants were taking jobs from Americans.  But in actuality, immigrants were  filling critical labor gaps,  economists say.\n \n\n   \n  While meat packing jobs initially built stable, middle-class lives, Hansen said, injuries like carpal tunnel surged as assembly lines became faster and more repetitive by the 1960s and 1970s, leading to an exodus of American workers. Then, immigrants filled the gap, shaping Nebraska’s farms, factories and towns for decades, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Immigrants, like Alejandra’s family who first migrated from Mexico to Iowa, as well as Latinos born in the US, have spent decades inside those plants, cutting, trimming, packing and processing meat that ends up on dinner tables across America.\n \n\n   \n  Ness Sandoval, a professor at Saint Louis University who studies inequality and Latino and immigrant demography, recalls growing up in Nebraska and his dad’s grueling job at a meatpacking plant.\n \n\n   \n  “He had no time or energy to go to any of my events or sports. He would make an effort when it was something meaningful, but he had to be in bed like at 8 o’clock,” Sandoval said. “It’s a very physical job on the body.”\n \n\n   \n  Injuries were once so routine Sandoval’s father was given an award for going a year without getting hurt. As the years passed, the repetitive work led him to suffer from shoulder injuries, arthritis and later, he retired after breaking his shoulder in a fall, Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n  Although his father took pride in his work, he never wanted his son to follow the same path “because he understood how difficult that job was on the body,” Sandoval said.\n \n\n   \n    Remote state prison transformed to hold immigrants\n \n\n   \n  The terracotta-colored building in McCook, Nebraska, soon to be referred as “Cornhusker Clink” was previously a state prison known as the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ Work Ethic Camp.\n \n\n   \n  With a focus on reintegrating low-risk offenders back into the community, the camp housed more than 180 inmates who often worked on-site at the facility’s kitchen or warehouse, according to a 2024  report.  Others filled road-crew jobs with the Nebraska Department of Transportation.\n \n\n   \n  The facility, opened since 2001, aimed to ease prison overcrowding “and make prison bed space available for violent offenders.” Decades later, the Nebraska prison system is still struggling to manage its current population, which is exceeding 140% of its design capacity, according to a  2024 report  by the state’s inspector general of the correctional system.\n \n\n   \n  Repurposing the facility in McCook is expected to further destabilize the prison system, said Mindy Chipman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.\n \n\n   \n  “Transitioning a minimum-security facility that provides reentry services — services the Department of Corrections says are more needed than ever — into an immigration detention center removes support from Nebraskans and confines people, most of whom have no criminal record,” Chipman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Current prisoners will be discharged, placed on parole or transferred to other correctional facilities “by the time the facility is ready to house ICE detainees,” the governor’s office said in a  September news release .\n \n\n   \n  When the converted ICE detention center opens, state officials said, people with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies will be eligible to be placed there but not those with felony convictions linked to acts of violence.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the governor’s office, the department of corrections and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Pillen’s motive is not safety, according to Chipman, but rather to signal support for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. The “Cornhusker Clink” is one of several new detention projects backed by the Trump administration’s $45 billion “ One Big Beautiful Bill ,” which would add 80,000 ICE beds nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the overcrowding, legal advocates in Nebraska said they worry the facility’s remote location could increase the likelihood of detainees experiencing civil rights violations, with many being far from family and attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  McCook is one of several small communities in southwestern Nebraska and sits somewhat close to Interstate 80, a major highway that travels east to Omaha – about four hours away – and west toward Denver – three hours away.\n \n\n   \n  There is no public bus from Omaha, the most populous city in the state, to McCook as well as to North Platte, a rural town about an hour north of it where most of the immigrants detained following the raid at the meatpacking plant in June were taken. All travel must be done by car, which could become tricky during the harsh Nebraska winters.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s easier to get to North Platte because it’s on I-80. McCook, you have to go further, and you are more in the middle of nowhere,” said Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Omaha-based nonprofit Heartland Workers Group, whose work involves advocating for migrants who are detained at immigration detention facilities in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “Isolation is part of the strategy,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Anne Wruth, an attorney with the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, who traveled west to meet with a detained client in North Platte, called the process a “logistical nightmare.”\n \n\n   \n  For lawmakers and advocates, who said they were surprised when plans for the ICE facility were announced, there are other pressing needs such as property taxes, labor shortage and affordable housing in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This was not something that went through us,” Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature whose district includes part of Omaha, said about state lawmakers and plans for the facility, noting the timeline was “extremely truncated.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘And if anything happens, you go’\n \n\n   \n  Alejandra is realizing the state she and her parents have called home and instantly made them feel welcome – where many still say “please” and “thank you” – has started to turn against them, or at least some people.\n \n\n   \n  When the family first arrived in Nebraska, Alejandra excelled in school where she was surrounded by classmates from Thailand, Haiti and El Salvador – a diversity fueled in part by the state’s refugee resettlement program, which welcomes the most refugees per capita compared to other US states despite Nebraska’s relatively small population of just over 2 million people, according to a  data analysis  from the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think tank tracking immigrant data.\n \n\n   \n  “It was awesome. I saw so many different races and nationalities — I wasn’t the only one,” Alejandra said. “Compared to Iowa, I wasn’t highlighted as ‘she is not from here.’”\n \n\n   \n  Her parents, who are also undocumented, own a home and pay taxes. They’ve seen their children and grandchildren grow up and enjoyed taking them to the park or baseball games.\n \n\n   \n  With animosity toward immigrants on the rise in the US and Nebraska, Alejandra says her parents will soon leave the country as they plan to self-deport to Mexico in six months. They are afraid to be detained and worry the conditions at ICE facilities could jeopardize her mother’s fragile health.\n \n\n   \n  “They do not like living in fear,” Alejandra said.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not immune to that fear, and neither are her children. In recent weeks, Alejandra gave her 13-year-old son instructions on what to do if anything were to happen to her as they drove to the grocery store.\n \n\n   \n  “’Mom, you stay in the car and I’ll go inside. I’ll get everything that we need. And if anything happens, you go, but you drive away,’” Alejandra recalled her son telling her. “I know who to call.”\n \n\n   \n  As she looks towards the future, Alejandra wonders what kind of future awaits her young sons, especially if the Nebraska she knows continues to transform and align with Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Like her parents, Alejandra says she may be forced to leave the state, and everything she knows, in exchange for a stable and happy life.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"17:38:00-05:00","title":"Defense Expert Testifies Ex-Assistant Principal Met Standards in Teacher Shooting Case","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile civil case worth $40 million, former Virginia elementary school teacher Abby Zwerner sued former assistant principal Ebony Parker for failing to act on warnings about a 6-year-old student with a history of disciplinary issues who later brought a firearm to school and shot her.

  5:38 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An expert for the defense in the $40 million  lawsuit  filed by a former Virginia elementary school teacher shot by a 6-year-old student with a history of disciplinary problems testified Monday the assistant principal did not breach professional standards or act with indifference.\n \n\n   \n  Former Assistant Principal Ebony Parker is accused of ignoring red flags that might have averted the 2023 shooting. Dr. Amy Klinger, an expert in education administration and school safety, said it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for the teacher, Abby Zwerner, rested their case last week, and the defense rested Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The  civil trial  could set a precedent for holding school officials accountable for gun violence on campus and comes ahead of Parker’s criminal trial next month on eight counts of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n    School safety is a shared responsibility\n \n\n   \n  Klinger testified the assistant principal’s role is collaborative and school safety is a shared responsibility among all staff, not just one individual. “No one is the sole person responsible for school safety,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She explained that assessing threats requires gathering credible information from those closest to the situation and that not every concern warrants an immediate or aggressive response.\n \n\n   \n  Parker did not breach professional standards or act with indifference, Klinger said, and it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident, especially given the rarity of a 6-year-old bringing a weapon to school.\n \n\n   \n  Klinger also said crisis plans provide guidance but require professional judgment and flexibility.\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination, Zwerner’s attorney, Kevin Biniazan, questioned whether Parker should have taken more proactive steps after being told a specific student was reported to have a gun, rather than waiting for more information.\n \n\n   \n  He highlighted Parker did not attempt to identify or speak directly with the students who reported the gun and pressed Klinger on whether this was sufficient effort to get “good information.”\n \n\n   \n  Biniazan emphasized Parker was aware of the possibility of a firearm on campus for about an hour and questioned whether her actions in that time were adequate.\n \n\n   \n  He asked Klinger to rate the likelihood of a gun being on campus at various points in the day, suggesting the risk increased as more information was received, and challenged whether Parker’s response — such as not searching the student or calling a lockdown — was an “underreaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier, Dr. Leigh Hagan, a board-certified forensic and clinical psychologist also testifying for the defense, said he reviewed extensive records to assess whether proper forensic standards were followed in forming mental health opinions for the court, though he did not personally evaluate Zwerner or offer opinions on her diagnosis or liability.\n \n\n   \n  He testified a mental health expert’s opinion is enhanced when they look at all of the information.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a responsibility … that you have the full movie of the person’s life, rather than a snapshot,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker, who resigned two weeks after the shooting, argues she is not responsible for the student harming his teacher and had no legal duty to intervene. Damages are not warranted, Parker argues, because Zwerner has moved on with her life.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s pain and suffering have been the focus of the trial so far, and Parker’s defense team this week is expected to continue to press Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done between learning of the possible gun threat and when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawsuit alleges Parker ignored “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched.”\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher said she thought she was going to die\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner on Thursday testified she thought her wounds were dire.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” the former first-grade teacher said as she recounted being shot in the hand and chest while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, a psychiatrist testified, and her hand will never be normal, even after six surgeries, an orthopedic surgeon said.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner also has changed since the  shooting  more than two years ago, her twin sister said.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner testified last week.\n \n\n   \n    Parker also faces criminal charges\n \n\n   \n  As school shootings  continue to plague  US campuses, this civil trial could serve as a roadmap for the upcoming criminal case against Parker, which itself could set a broader precedent.\n \n\n   \n  Attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  It is also rare for civil cases to precede criminal ones, but it could be strategic in the case of Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in her trial next month, legal experts say.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the mother of the child who shot Zwerner has been  sentenced to two years  in prison for child neglect, the school board voted out the superintendent and the principal was reassigned to another school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial resumes Wednesday, after Election Day Tuesday.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/diane-ladd-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Diane Ladd, 3-Time Oscar Nominee, Dies at 89","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diane Ladd, a three-time Academy Award nominee and acclaimed actress known for her powerful performances in films such as 'Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore' and 'Wild at Heart,' has died at the age of 89.

nominee, dies at 89 \n       \n  By The Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n   Diane Ladd , the three-time Academy Award nominee whose roles ranged from the brash waitress in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” to the protective mother in “Wild at Heart,” has died at 89.\n \n\n   \n  Ladd’s death was announced Monday by daughter  Laura Dern , who issued a statement saying her mother and occasional co-star had died at her home in Ojai, California, with Dern at her side. Dern, who called Ladd her “amazing hero” and “profound gift of a mother,” did not immediately cite a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  “She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” Dern wrote. “We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”\n \n\n   \n  A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese’s 1974 release “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appears in dozens of movies over the following decades. Her many credits included “Chinatown,” “Primary Colors” and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, “Wild at Heart” and “Rambling Rose,” both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in “ER,” “Touched by Angel” and “Alice,” the spinoff from “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” among others.\n \n\n   \n  Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura’s father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in “Rambling Rose” and they also were memorably paired in “Wild at Heart,” a personal favorite of Ladd’s and winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In the dark, farcical  David Lynch  noir, her character, Marietta, is willing to try anything – including murder – to keep her daughter (Laura Dern) away from her ex-con lover, played by Nicolas Cage. Ladd would be called upon by the director for some Lynchian touches, and countered with some of her own.\n \n\n   \n  “One day, the script said that Marietta gets in bed, curls up with her baby dog, and is sucking her thumb,” she told Vulture in 2024. “I looked at him and said, ‘David, I don’t want to do that.’ He said, ’What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘I want to put on a long satin nightgown, I want to stand in the middle of the bed holding a martini and drinking it, and I want to sway to the old music within my head.’ He said ‘OK.’ I did it, and he loved it.”\n \n\n   \n  A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was born Rose Diane Ladner and was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, “Spiraling Through the School of Life,” she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day in “front of a screen” and would “command” her own audiences. Before “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” she had been working in television since the 1950s, when she was in her early 20s, with shows including “Perry Mason,” “Gunsmoke” and “The Big Valley.”\n \n\n   \n  By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I don’t say that,” she said. “I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.”\n \n\n   \n  Ladd was married three times, and divorced twice – from Bruce Dern and from William A. Shea, Jr. In 1976, around the time her second marriage ended, she told the Times that neither of her husbands knew “how to show love.”\n \n\n   \n  “I come from the South and from a man, my father, who gave me rocking‐chair love. My people pass love around, and why I selected two men who needed someone to give love and didn’t know how to give it. …” She paused. “I hope I won’t repeat that again.”\n \n\n   \n  Ladd’s third marriage, to author-former PepsiCo executive Robert Charles Hunter, lasted from 1999 until his death in August.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/missing-mary-johnson-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:33:00-05:00","title":"Remains of Indigenous woman missing since 2020 found in Washington state, police say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The remains of Mary Johnson, a 39-year-old enrolled member of the Tulalip Tribes, were identified in Snohomish County, Washington, through DNA analysis.

Max Saltman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The route from the land of the dead to San Andrés Mixquic, a little town just outside Mexico City, is lined with marigolds. Ángel Jiménez del Aguila, who died in 2010, need only follow the trail of flower petals, the scent of smoldering copal and the rhythm of  danzón  music to find his old front door, where his wife and children wait for him.\n \n\n   \n  According to Mexican tradition, every year, the door between the world of the living and the dead swings open on the first two days of November. This is Día de los Muertos,  the Day of the Dead .\n \n\n   \n  Often mischaracterized as a Mexican version of Halloween, the Day of the Dead is many things depending on whom you ask.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a festival to remember departed relatives, a celebration of Mexican-ness, an ancient holiday with roots in the Aztec Empire, a not-so-ancient Mexican spin on All Saint’s Day, the setting for  Disney’s “Coco”  – or all the above.\n \n\n   \n  “It is an act of faith, of love, of peace,” says Martha Nashieli Jiménez Bernal, Ángel’s daughter. For her, above all, the Day of the Dead is “a magical moment where life and death come together.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 12 o’clock, welcome dad!” Martha says, waving a smoking censer back and forth over the golden flowers that snake from the garden gate into the parlor of her childhood home. “Welcome.”\n \n\n   \n  The trail of marigold petals leads to an  ofrenda , an altar covered with even more flowers, colorful cloth, fruit, candy skulls and photos of Ángel and other relatives.\n \n\n   \n  Martha breaks chunks of copal into her censer as she kneels before the altar. Standing up, she holds up a plate of  pan de Muertos –  sweet baked bread in the shape of skulls.\n \n\n   \n  “Dad, welcome to your home, with your children,” Martha says, her voice cracking with emotion. “You know we love you, and I’ve been looking forward to this day so much, to be able to be with you again. Welcome, Ángel Jiménez.”\n \n\n   \n     Changing times \n \n\n   \n  In recent years, celebrations for the Day of the Dead have taken on new influences,   some gleaned from Hollywood.\n \n\n   \n  The same day that the Jiménez family was welcoming their loved ones in the intimacy of their house, a popular parade for the Day of the Dead filled the streets of Mexico City. The practice is very new: it was adopted after the 2015 James Bond movie “Spectre”    showed Daniel Craig making his way through a lively Day of the Dead parade in its opening scene.\n \n\n   \n  Even in San Andrés Mixquic, known for its traditional celebrations, some wear the sort of spooky Halloween costumes sold in the United States, although local families themselves do not dress up.\n \n\n   \n  For the Jiménez family, the Day of the Dead is a deeply personal tradition. They take pride in preparing their altar with fruits from the local market and carefully cleaning their relatives’ headstones. Martha even gathers the flowers by hand from the family’s  chinampa , a traditional floating garden the Aztecs cultivated hundreds of years ago, making the ritual both intimate and rooted in family history.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a treasure, it is a gift. It is an inheritance that we are living,” says Leonor Bernal Roque, Martha’s mother. Her earliest memory is of her grandfather decorating their family’s altar when she was five years old.\n \n\n   \n  “From the age of five,” she says, “I began to feel love for my ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead teaches “that death is a transition, it is not a punishment,” she says. People “must practice gratitude toward their ancestors.”\n \n\n   \n  “Memory should be important,” Leonor says.\n \n\n   \n     History lesson \n \n\n   \n  The Day of the Dead unfolds over three days in San Andrés Mixquic. On October 31, the family commemorates the souls of children at the altar. The next day, November 1, they greet their adult relatives, like Martha’s father Angel. The third day, families gather at the cemetery from morning till night to decorate graves and say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  While the holiday has its roots in the Aztec empire prior to Spain’s conquest in 1521, the modern-day celebration blends indigenous Mexican themes with the European Christian tradition of All Saint’s Day, when some Christians visit their departed loved ones in cemeteries.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after arriving in the Americas , Spanish monks noticed the Aztecs had their own celebrations to commune with departed ancestors, according to historian Héctor Zaraus.\n \n\n   \n  “In the Aztec, Zapotec, and Mayan calendar, one of the months was dedicated to the dead, and it was   adapted to the first and second of November with the arrival of the Spanish,” says Zaraus, a scholar at the Mora Institute in Mexico City.\n \n\n   \n  The indigenous elements are the most prominent parts of the contemporary ceremony, Zaraus says, especially the tombs festooned with marigolds. Even the photographs on family altars have their roots in ancient times: Zaraus says the Aztecs “used clay figures to portray the dead.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s more than one way to celebrate the Day of the Dead, however. María del Carmen Eugenia Reyes Ruiz, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, notes that the celebration differs throughout Mexico. She also says that, while some aspects of the modern-day celebration may have ancient roots, others are far more recent additions than might commonly be believed.\n \n\n   \n  “As for the way we celebrate it in Mexico – with colors, candles, altars, and flower paths – I think it’s also worth noting that it isn’t common throughout the entire country, and it’s certainly not as ancient as it’s often made to seem,” Reyes says. “It’s a very romantic and beautiful idea, but not entirely accurate.”\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of other cultures have similar ceremonies, some older than Mexico’s, Reyes says. For thousands of years, families in China have celebrated  Qingming  after the spring equinox, cleaning and decorating their ancestor’s graves and offering plates of sweet dumplings.\n \n\n   \n  “Although it may sound a little unromantic, there’s something I’d like to make clear,” Reyes says. “The idea of the Day of the Dead celebration, while it is indeed part of Mexican culture, is not exclusive to Mexico.”\n \n\n   \n     The doorway closes \n \n\n   \n  The sun has set in San Andrés Mixquic, but the cemetery here is filled with light. Nearly everyone in town is here for the signature, final celebration of the Day of the Dead. The door between this world and the next is about to close, and it’s time to say goodbye.\n \n\n   \n  After days of cleaning graves and decorating tombstones, the graveyard is awash in color and flickering candles. It’s loud – people are cheerfully talking, remembering their loved ones, playing music, eating food and toasting with mezcal. The bells in the church nearby are tolling.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tourists from around the world wander the cemetery, the Jiménez family treats the holiday as a sacred communion, inviting outsiders only to witness and participate respectfully. Martha says that even these tourists, some of whom come from places as far as Japan, are playing a part in the festivities: their curiosity is part of what keeps the tradition alive.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a kind of communion,” she muses as she stands at her father’s grave. “A bond is formed, a connection with them. Even if we don’t know them, we know they come with respect and a desire to learn about our traditions. So, we invite them to come respectfully – to come live our tradition, to get to know it, to preserve it, to take it back to their own homes.”\n \n\n   \n  Diana, Martha’s 19-year-old niece, agrees. She’s made up her face to look like a skull and holds a candle under her chin.\n \n\n   \n  “Tourists, if they have a family member, can also set up their own offering, and in this way, this tradition won’t die,” Diana says. “My family, especially my aunt (Martha), is the one who has instilled this tradition in us so much.”\n \n\n   \n  As the night ends in the graveyard, the family toasts Ángel with mezcal.\n \n\n   \n  “My family is happy and joyful because these were days of hard work, days of great effort,” Martha says. “Some siblings came from far away; others could not be here.”\n \n\n   \n  Martha does not have children, but she knows that she’s entrusted her nieces and nephews with the traditions to keep the Day of the Dead alive long after she’s buried in this cemetery herself.\n \n\n   \n  “I just want them to also welcome me the day I depart,” Martha says. “I want them not to forget me, to know that their aunt will come, and that I love them in the most organic way possible. That they receive me with all the love I gave them – and I know they will. I’m sure of it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597788","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:35:00-05:00","title":"Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race, in a historic victory for progressives","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Ugandan-born democratic socialist, won the 2025 New York City mayoral election, becoming the city's first Muslim and person of South Asian descent mayor and the youngest in over a century.

PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of New York City, becoming the first Muslim and person of South Asian descent — as well as the youngest in over a century — to hold the position. The 34-year-old, Ugandan-born democratic socialist defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday's election, according to a race call by the Associated Press. It's a remarkable ascent for Mamdani, who was a relatively unknown state assemblymember representing Queens when he entered the crowded mayoral race last year. He went on to win June's Democratic primary by 12 percentage points, quickly becoming one of the country's most  popular and polarizing  politicians along the way. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of Mamdani's main campaign promises include making the city's buses fare-free, freezing stabilized rents, providing universal child care, increasing the minimum wage by 2030 and lowering the cost of living by raising taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers. Mamdani has also said he would stand up to President Trump, who has frequently criticized — and mischaracterized — Mamdani as a communist and  repeatedly threatened  to slash New York City's federal funding if he wins. Critics have pointed to Mamdani's relative inexperience and the political challenges he would face in delivering on his ambitious, highly progressive agenda. And, despite his repeated disavowal of antisemitism, his vocal and long-held criticisms of Israel's government and actions in Gaza have alienated some voters in a city that's home to the  largest Jewish community  outside of Israel. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Mamdani's vision of a more affordable city, articulated through savvy social media videos and upbeat in-person interactions, has clearly resonated with young and first-time voters (even  outside of New York ). He won endorsements from scores of  high-profile progressives , mobilized  tens of thousands  of campaign volunteers and held a  double-digit lead  in polls going into Election Day. Young voters, who were likely to have supported Mamdani, are credited with  driving record early-voter turnout .  Less than an hour after polls closed on Tuesday, it was clear his efforts had paid off. A recap of the race New York City's mayoral race unfolded in a series of dramatic twists and turns, clashes and unlikely alliances. It energized voters and, in the end, more than two million votes were cast — the first time since 1969, according to the  New York City Board of Elections . Current Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, initially ran for a second term, despite a scandal-ridden first term and all-time low  approval ratings . After the Trump administration formally  dismissed the corruption case  against him, he announced his reelection bid in June, this time as an independent. That allowed Adams to bypass the Democratic primary, in which Mamdani triumphed over Cuomo. Mamdani's win was seen as an upset to the establishment, since the 67-year-old Cuomo is the son of a three-time New York governor and held the position himself for a decade beginning in 2011. In 2021, after numerous women  accused him of sexual misconduct  and questions swirled about his administration's  management of nursing home residents  during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo resigned as governor to avoid a likely impeachment trial, but denied all wrongdoing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Angling for a comeback, Cuomo entered the mayoral race  in March , saying the city was \"in crisis\" and in need of \"effective leadership.\" His platform emphasized issues like public safety, affordable housing, healthcare and fighting antisemitism — with a more centrist stance compared to Mamdani. Cuomo reentered the race as an independent after his primary loss, seeking to appeal to more moderate voters. He also got Adams' endorsement after the mayor  dropped out  in late September. At that point, the race narrowed to three main contenders: Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa, a 71-year-old radio talk show host and founder of the subway patrol organization, the Guardian Angels, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Sliwa, who ran against Adams in 2021, was determined to remain in this year's race despite third-place poll numbers and  mounting calls  to drop out, from his own party as well as Cuomo himself. Their concern was that Sliwa would take votes away from Cuomo, propelling Mamdani to victory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The three faced off in two  contentious debates  in October, in which Mamdani and Cuomo sparred over issues of integrity and experience while Sliwa sought to paint them as two sides of the same ideological coin. Tuesday's election marks a pivotal moment for liberal-leaning New York City and the Democratic establishment. Both have grappled with how to respond to the Trump administration, which has targeted blue cities nationwide ( including the Big Apple ) with funding cuts and National Guard troops. The high stakes and voter enthusiasm of this election were evident well before Election Day: The city Board of Elections said 735,317 voters cast ballots during early voting,  more than five times  the number of early voters in 2021. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting musical performances hosted at the NPR Tiny Desk series, which showcases artists performing in a small, intimate setting.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Intimate Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/americas/jamaica-black-river-destruction-after-hurricane-melissa-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"16:59:00Z","title":"Desperate survivors in Jamaica try to kickstart recovery as they wait for help for the living — and the dead","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm that devastated western Jamaica, survivors in towns like Belmont, Black River, and White House face severe shortages of food, water, power, and medical care.

wait for help for the living — and the dead \n       \n  By David Culver, Joe Merkel and Sean Walker, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:59 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The air smells of damp earth and drying mud. Smoke from debris fires mixes with a faint tang of fuel from the few generators that still have gas. Every sound carries: the strike of hammers and the scrape of shovels as Jamaicans try to dig out and rebuild after Hurricane Melissa slammed into the island.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached the  hardest-hit western parishes  and the towns of Belmont, Black River and White House, where destruction is uneven but staggering. Some neighborhoods are gutted, others look untouched.\n \n\n   \n  Roofs were peeled away, and windows blown out in the Category 5 hurricane, leaving no protection from the rain and up to 16 feet of seawater driven onto land in the storm surge.\n \n\n   \n  Possessions have been dragged out to dry as much as they can in the hot and humid conditions. And everywhere, survivors try to make sense of it all.\n \n\n   \n  Three-year-old Alessandra points to what used to be her bed. “It’s all mash up,” she says with a small smile.\n \n\n   \n  Her mother, Alandrea Brown, 26, walks around what remains of their home. “We are very distressed,” she says. “We really need some help because you have persons who are very homeless, and we don’t really have any food supplies.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that help has yet to come.\n \n\n   \n  As we prepare to leave, a man points to another house. Inside, he says, a neighbor’s body still lies uncollected. Through a broken window, a sheet covers the remains of a man, one of his hands resting outside the cover.\n \n\n   \n  There was no way for neighbors to call for help. No phone signal. No road access. CNN relayed the information to authorities once the team was able. It is a haunting reminder of how cut off this region remains.\n \n\n   \n  In Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, and across the east, life goes on. Volunteers and supplies are pushing west to help people and start to heal the vital economic lifelines of tourism and agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  Jamaican officials raised the nation’s death toll to 32 on Monday. It will almost certainly rise as emergency teams reach more devastated areas.\n \n\n   \n  But for now, when night falls, the west of the island goes quiet. No power. No water. Only the chirp of insects and the distant hum of a generator. Mattresses are dragged back inside, still damp but something to sleep on. The air smells of wet wood and salt.\n \n\n   \n  By morning, long lines form for fuel, food, and clean water. Those without running taps turn to the river or rainwater pipes. Families wash clothes, fill buckets, and share stories about what they lost.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess it doesn’t really hit us yet,” says Simone Gardon, 40, when asked about the impact of the storm —  the strongest ever  to hit Jamaica. Her voice trails off as she looks to when things may become clearer. “After two weeks, when it’s all settled down and the hunger sets in…”\n \n\n   \n  Neighbors have become their own first responders. They move fallen trees, lift tangled wires, and hammer tin over broken beams. They rebuild because they must, knowing help is on the way, but not soon enough.\n \n\n   \n    Treating patients in a ruined hospital\n \n\n   \n  In Black River, the region’s main hospital is barely standing. Rain leaks through the roof. Corridors sit in darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Medical Officer Dr. Sheriff Imoru tells CNN his home was destroyed too, compounding his heartache. “When I see this place, my hospital, it’s very difficult even to come through the gates in the mornings. But I have to.”\n \n\n   \n  He and his staff, many of whom also lost their homes, keep showing up. The emergency room still operates without power or running water.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the few dry rooms, Shaniel Tomlin holds her one-year-old son, Jahmar, who hit his head after the storm. He’s covered in bandages, like a war veteran. She has a prescription in her hand, but nowhere to fill it.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything’s gone,” she says softly, her eyes welling as the weight of what’s ahead begins to sink in.\n \n\n   \n  Across this centuries-old coastal town, buildings like the courthouse, library, government offices and the elementary school are destroyed.\n \n\n   \n  From Kingston, trucks loaded with food, fuel and aid wind their way west, at times sitting for hours in traffic as roads are slowly cleared.\n \n\n   \n  “We are resilient,” says Lisa Hanna, a former member of parliament. “There’s almost an empathetic solidarity across the island and across the world to get things here. We’re not going to make our people starve.”\n \n\n   \n  Groups including World Central Kitchen, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan’s Purse are already on the ground, setting up kitchens and delivering water. Relief teams expect to stay for months. And even that may not be enough.\n \n\n   \n  The tourism industry, the backbone of Jamaica’s economy, is watching closely. Officials stress that much of the island remains open, especially the north and east, as peak season begins next month. But in the west, where Melissa hit hardest, rebuilding will take time.\n \n\n   \n  When a radio signal returns, so does the sound of resilience. Music drifts through the salt air as roadside vendors fry fish on bare concrete slabs, their foodstands long washed away. The scent of smoke and the rhythm of song fill what silence the storm left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “We are Jamaicans,” one man shouts. “We are the strongest people in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  The winds are gone, the water has receded, but the scars will last. In western Jamaica, the fight is just beginning.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590033","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"Rep.

Mikie Sherrill wins N.J. governor in Tuesday's second victory for Democrats \n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 9:29 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A former Navy pilot, first elected to Congress in 2018, will be New Jersey's next governor. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated former Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, according to a race call by The Associated Press, capping a closely-watched gubernatorial election that some polls predicted would be a coin flip. Sherrill's victory marks the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. Her victory is also the second major win for Democrats on Tuesday, following   Abigail Spanberger's  win for Virginia governor. The race was also one of the first statewide votes since President Trump began his second term. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli in May ahead of the Republican primary. The tight race  has surprised some  in the traditionally blue state, which has had a Democratic governor for the past eight years and a legislature controlled by Democrats for even longer. But the  possibility that the governorship could flip  to a Republican — along with the statewide contest being seen as an indicator of public opinion on Trump's second term — put the election in the national spotlight and  drew nearly $200 million  in spending. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli earlier this year, saying that after Ciattarelli got to \"know and understand MAGA\" he went \"ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!).\" Ciattarelli had previously criticized the president. Meanwhile, former President Obama endorsed Sherrill in an online video message and later joined her on the campaign trail. Sherrill, also a former federal prosecutor and attorney, entered politics less than a decade ago when she was elected to Congress in 2018. This was the third time Ciattarelli, a former CPA and small business owner, had run for governor. But even though Democrats hold an advantage over Republicans on the voter rolls, New Jersey residents have chosen governors from both parties. \"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections,\" Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship at Rowan University,  told NPR  in October. Affordability has been perhaps the most prominent issue of the campaign. Both candidates have bemoaned the state's high cost of living and surging energy prices, with Ciattarelli vowing to lower New Jersey's high property taxes and Sherrill promising to freeze electricity bills. But in the final weeks of the race, both campaigns traded personal attacks. Ciattarelli repeatedly questioned Sherrill's involvement in a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994. She said she was prohibited from walking at her graduation because she failed to turn in her classmates, and blasted the Trump administration for releasing her mostly unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign. For her part, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli's former publishing company of producing materials that downplayed the dangers of opioids, saying in one of the televised debates between the pair that her opponent was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey. Ciattarelli said Sherrill was lying and  threatened to sue  her for defamation. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587742","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:10:00-20:00","title":"California voters OK new congressional lines, boosting Democrats ahead of midterms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters have approved Proposition 50, a ballot measure to redraw congressional district lines in favor of Democrats, marking a significant political victory in the national redistricting battle.

congressional lines, boosting Democrats ahead of midterms \n         By Guy Marzorati \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 11:10 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SAN FRANCISCO — California voters have easily approved a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats, according to a race call by The Associated Press, marking the party's biggest victory to date in a national battle over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. The measure, called Proposition 50, will replace lines drawn by an independent commission with a map that could net Democrats as many as five new seats in next year's U.S. House elections. The AP called the race just as polls closed in California. The result caps a strong election night for Democrats, who also pocketed notable wins in  Virginia  and  New Jersey . In an abbreviated campaign that saturated California's airwaves with ads, Gov. Gavin Newsom convinced voters that the state needed to draw new maps to counteract gerrymandering done at President Trump's behest in Republican-led states such as Texas. In  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina , the new GOP-friendly maps were enacted after approval by the state legislature. But in California, Newsom and Democratic allies needed to win approval from voters for the new political lines, because voters had given congressional line-drawing power to an independent citizens commission in 2010. The commission remains popular in California, but Newsom was able to  amplify the partisan stakes  of the campaign, arguing that California could not stand by and watch Republicans bake in a sizable advantage through redistricting ahead of midterm elections that will decide control of power in a closely divided House of Representatives. The results, said California political strategist Erica Kwiatkowski Nielsen, \"shows a huge appetite and just the willingness of Californians to stand up to Donald Trump.\" \"I think the campaign did a fantastic job of saying and acknowledging people's fears that, hey, we've been a leader in California on redistricting but this isn't politics as usual,\" Nielsen said. \"These are unprecedented times.\" Newsom's \"Yes\" side wins the money battle Newsom, who has positioned himself as a primary foil to Trump, amassed a war chest to support the measure — bringing in nearly $120 million as of Friday. Top donors included House Majority PAC, a group working to elect Democrats to the House, and George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform. The Yes campaign blanketed the state with ads featuring top Democrats, from former President Barack Obama to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Polling in the last week of the campaign  showed more than 90% of Democrats supporting the measure and more than 90% of Republicans opposed. That didn't bode well for opponents of Proposition 50, given Democrats' strong registration advantage in the state. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The campaign against Proposition 50 was led by Charles Munger Jr., a Bay Area donor who bankrolled the original campaign to create the citizens redistricting commission in 2008. Munger contributed nearly $33 million to the No on 50 campaign — but his donations accounted for roughly three-quarters of the $44 million raised by opponents. Other Republican heavyweights stayed away from the campaign and spending against Proposition 50 dried up in the final weeks of the race, as polling showed the measure opening up a wide lead. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former California Republican governor who worked with Munger to create the citizens commission, played a restrained role in the campaign — voicing his opposition to Proposition 50 in just a handful of interviews and public appearances. The changes to the state's congressional map are sure to trigger a series of difficult decisions for Republican incumbents in the coming weeks. U.S. Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa will have to weigh running in districts where chances of reelection range from challenging to virtually impossible. The new lines approved under Proposition 50 will remain in place through the 2030 election, after which the citizens commission would again take over redistricting responsibilities. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/best-christmas-markets-world","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+08:00","title":"Digital Transformation in Education: Bridging the Urban-Rural Divide","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article explores the growing trend of digital transformation in education, focusing on the integration of technology in classrooms.

In fact, some have grown so popular that they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s CNN Travel’s rundown of some of the top Christmas markets taking place around the world this year:\n \n\n   \n    Wiener Christkindlmarkt, Austria\n \n\n   \n  With a reindeer train, a giant Ferris wheel and a giant Advent wreath, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Austrian capital holds around 20 Christmas markets, Wiener Christkindlmarkt (or Rathausplatz) is one of its oldest and most traditional events.\n \n\n   \n  The event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, is held in front of City Hall and features a 110-square-meter children’s ice rink. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of stalls   offer tasty treats such as Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.\n \n\n   \n   Wiener Christkindlmarkt  runs from November 14 to December 26.   The ice rink, or Ice Dream at the Christmas Market, will be open until January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  Most Swiss towns are taken over by festive markets at this time of year, and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around.\n \n\n   \n  Separated into two sections, at Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz, it hosts around 150 decorated stalls selling everything from Christmas spices, decorations and candles.\n \n\n   \n  Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Münsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star-making workshop and a puppet show.\n \n\n   \n  Attendees can take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for views of the lights illuminating the old town or sip on mulled wine at the  13-meter-high Christmas pyramid  on Barfüsserplatz.\n \n\n   \n   Basel Christmas Market  opens on November 27 and is scheduled to run until December 23. \n \n\n   \n    Strasbourg Christmas Market, France\n \n\n   \n  One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets,  Strasbourg’s  began back in 1570, but has evolved considerably since then.\n \n\n   \n  Spread over more than 10 locations, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling lights and festive ornaments.\n \n\n   \n  Drawing in over 2 million people a year, it features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine.\n \n\n   \n  Place Kleber is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares.\n \n\n   \n   Strasbourg Christmas Market  begins on November 26 and closes on December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Brussels Winter Wonders, Belgium\n \n\n   \n  Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market.\n \n\n   \n  One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the open spaces of the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons.\n \n\n   \n  A light and sound show, ice skating and fairground rides are among the activities and places to enjoy. Visitors can also browse through about 200 chalets serving  glühwein  (mulled wine), Belgian beers and waffles while staring in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree in Grand Place.\n \n\n   \n   Brussels Winter Wonders  will run from November 28  to January 5. \n \n\n   \n    Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic\n \n\n   \n  To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.\n \n\n   \n  Old Town Square provides entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops. Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats such as klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.\n \n\n   \n   The markets will be open from November 29 to January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Fira de Santa Llucia, Barcelona\n \n\n   \n  Dating from 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the December 13 feast day of Santa Llucia to a three-week fair.\n \n\n   \n  Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four sections.\n \n\n   \n  The first is Nativity and Figurines, where visitors can pick up decorations and models to create traditional Bethlehem manger scenes. The Greenery and Plants section is packed with both natural and artificial trees and, of course, plants.\n \n\n   \n  The Crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while the Simbombes section is mainly made up of musical instruments.\n \n\n   \n  There are also many festive activities such as storytelling, a Christmas parade and the  Caga Tió , an enormous, piñata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick.\n \n\n   \n   Fira de Santa Llucia  2025 dates TBC \n \n\n   \n    I Mercati Natale, Piazza Santa Croce, Florence\n \n\n   \n  There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica.\n \n\n   \n  Although this traditional fair, also known as Weihnachtsmarkt, is based on German street markets, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many local treats, such as panforte, for sale.\n \n\n   \n  However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies.\n \n\n   \n  Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8.\n \n\n   \n   I Mercati Natale  begins on November 15 and runs to December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Advent in Zagreb, Croatia\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years.\n \n\n   \n  Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight.\n \n\n   \n  Think live Nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves.\n \n\n   \n  Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment.\n \n\n   \n   Advent in Zagreb 2025  is scheduled to run from November 29 to January 7. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark\n \n\n   \n  Visited several times by Walt Disney before he developed Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year.\n \n\n   \n  But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s line up of activities also includes a magical light installation of luminous “fireworks.”\n \n\n   \n  The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas in Tivoli  is taking place from November 14 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia\n \n\n   \n  The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets.\n \n\n   \n  Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale.\n \n\n   \n  On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors are also treated to performances by dance troupes and choirs.\n \n\n   \n  But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441.\n \n\n   \n   Tallinn Christmas Market 2025  is due to take place from November 21 to December 28. \n \n\n   \n    Skansen’s Christmas Market, Stockholm\n \n\n   \n  Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen.\n \n\n   \n  Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic.\n \n\n   \n  The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion, and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can join the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site.\n \n\n   \n   Skansen’s Christmas Market  is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 28 until December 21. \n \n\n   \n    Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki\n \n\n   \n  This wonderfully Nordic Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue.\n \n\n   \n  Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies,  glögi  (Finland’s take on mulled wine) and handicrafts are also a big draw.\n \n\n   \n  Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities such as Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive with a host of top eateries from which to choose.\n \n\n   \n   Tuomaan Markkinat  is set to run from November 28 to December 22, 2025.  \n \n\n   \n    St. Stephen’s Basilica and Vörösmarty Square markets, Budapest, Hungary\n \n\n   \n  Budapest has two main festive markets: St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or  Advent Bazilika , and Vörösmarty Square Christmas market.\n \n\n   \n  The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Vörösmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts more than 800,000 visitors annually.\n \n\n   \n  Its main highlight is usually a giant Advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the  Hungarian foods that line its stalls — langos and chimney cake — are also particular standouts.\n \n\n   \n   Advent Bazilika opens on November 14 and runs to January 1. \n \n\n   \n   The Vörösmarty   Square Christmas market will open on November 14 and close on December 31. \n \n\n   \n    Christkindlesmarkt and Gendarmenmarkt, Germany\n \n\n   \n  Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets.\n \n\n   \n  Capital city Berlin has around 80 of them, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned.\n \n\n   \n  Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with special Christmas gifts. Visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances.\n \n\n   \n  In Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stalls are erected in the city’s central market square, and the whole area is abuzz with activity.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually draws in around 2 million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights.\n \n\n   \n   Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 202 5  kicks off on November 28 and ends on December 24. \n \n\n   \n   Gendarmenmarkt   opens on November 24 and is set to close on December 31 .\n \n\n   \n    Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, London\n \n\n   \n  Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital.\n \n\n   \n  The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus fairground rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can also join ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus show, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village.\n \n\n   \n   Hyde Park Winter Wonderland  is scheduled to open on November 14 and will continue until January 1, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Edinburgh at Christmas, Scotland\n \n\n   \n  From an ice rink to immersive light displays, the Scottish capital’s historic city center is abuzz with festive markets and attractions throughout winter.\n \n\n   \n  Over in popular urban park East Princes Street Garden, there’s a traditional Christmas market with up to 70 stalls, a Ferris wheel and an 80-meter star flyer fairground ride — the world’s largest transportable star flyer.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers are treated to spectacular views of the iconic Scott Monument, along with Edinburgh Castle, where the after-dark Castle of Light attraction will be held from late November to early January.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a Christmas tree maze can be found at St. Andrew Square Garden and new attraction, the Ice Queen’s Castle, which features ice carvings and wall etchings, will be erected on George Street, one of the city’s top shopping spots.\n \n\n   \n   The Christmas market at East Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh’s main festive market, will be open from November 15 until January 4, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Krakow Christmas Market, Poland\n \n\n   \n  Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as  kiełbasa  (sausage), shop for handcrafted gifts or treats and take in live music from folk bands and carol singers.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually hosts a competition in which participants, including schoolchildren and local artists, create small Nativity scenes, or cribs.

Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the Israeli army's top lawyer. Now she is behind bars and at the center of a scandal rocking the country after a bizarre sequence of events that included her abrupt resignation, a brief disappearance and a frantic search that led authorities to find her on a Tel Aviv beach. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The soap opera-worthy saga was touched off last week by Tomer-Yerushalmi's explosive admission that she approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of a politically divisive investigation into allegations of severe abuse against a Palestinian at a notorious Israeli military prison. The video shows part of an assault in which Israeli soldiers are accused of sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee. By leaking the video last year, Tomer-Yerushalmi aimed to expose the seriousness of the allegations her office was investigating. Instead, it triggered fierce criticism from Israel's hard-line political leaders. After Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned under pressure last week, her critics continued to heave personal insults. She left a cryptic note for her family and abandoned her car near a beach. That led to fears she had taken her own life and prompted an intensive search that included the use of military drones. She was found alive at the beach Sunday night, at which point more vitriol against her was unleashed. \"We can resume the lynch,\" right-wing TV personality Yinon Magal, an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, posted on X with a winking-face emoji. After it was revealed that one of Tomer-Yerushalmi's phones had disappeared, right-wing politicians and commentators began to accuse her of staging a suicide attempt as a way to destroy potential evidence. The extraordinary episode shows two years of devastating war have done little to heal a country that was deeply divided even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It also makes Tomer-Yerushalmi the latest in a long line of top security officials who have either left office or been forced out, most of them to be replaced by people considered loyal to Netanyahu and his hardline government. Anger over leak distracts from severe abuse at heart of case At a court hearing Monday, the judge said Tomer-Yerushalmi's detention would be extended until Wednesday on suspicion of committing fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. While the investigation into her actions continues, she is being held at a women's prison in central Israel. Israeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested in connection with the leak investigation. The prime minister's office has refused to comment on Solomesh's arrest. The fury over the leaked video reveals the depth of polarization in Israel — and at least for the moment, keeps the media and the public focused on the leak and not the allegations of abuse. The assault occurred on July 5, 2024, at the Sde Teiman military prison, according to the indictment against the accused soldiers. The AP has investigated allegations of inhumane treatment and abuse at Sde Teiman that predate those in the surveillance video. The video, which has been aired by Israeli news, shows soldiers taking a detainee into an area they cordoned off with shields in an apparent attempt to hide their actions. The indictment said the soldiers assaulted the Palestinian prisoner and sodomized him with a knife, causing multiple injuries. A medical staffer familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety said the detainee arrived at a civilian hospital in life-threatening condition with blunt trauma to the abdomen and the chest and fractured ribs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said the detainee underwent surgery for a perforated rectum and was released back to Sde Teiman days later. The staffer said it was the most extreme abuse case he was familiar with from Sde Teiman. When military police came to Sde Teiman in July to detain the soldiers suspected of abuse, they scuffled with protesters opposed to the arrests. Later, hundreds of violent protesters broke into the detention center. In her resignation letter, Tomer-Yerushalmi wrote that she had exposed evidence of the abuse to counter the idea that the military was unfairly targeting its own soldiers. That idea was creating a danger to the military's law enforcement, she said, citing the break-in. She wrote that the military had a \"duty to investigate when there is reasonable suspicion of violence against a detainee. \"Unfortunately, this basic understanding — that there are actions which must never be taken even against the vilest of detainees — no longer convinces everyone,\" she wrote. The Palestinian detainee who was the subject of the alleged abuse in the video was released back to Gaza last month as part of an exchange between living hostages and Palestinian prisoners, according to documents from the military prosecutor's office obtained by the AP. The case is still pending before the military court. A web of legal issues Three separate legal issues must be sorted out as part of Israel's investigation into what happened at Sde Teiman, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute. The first relates to evidence that Israeli soldiers abused Palestinian detainees while they were in detention. The second is whether Israeli civilians, including members of parliament, tried to disrupt the investigation by breaking into the military base where the soldiers accused of the actions were being held. The third is whether Tomer-Yerushalmi allegedly committed a host of offenses, including fraud, to undermine the investigation into how the surveillance video was leaked to the media. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The intense rhetoric over the past few days is reminiscent of what it was like in Israel immediately before the Oct. 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza, Plesner said. At the time, the public was deeply divided over Netanyahu's push to overhaul the judiciary. The concern for a few hours Sunday night about Tomer-Yerushalmi's fate should serve as a \"stop sign\" to the Israeli public — and especially to commentators who derided her personally, Plesner said. \"It was very sad to see how the internal discourse can bring about such potentially tragic outcome on a personal level,\" Plesner said. It felt especially symbolic, he said, that Tomer-Yerushalmi was in court while the Israeli government held its official memorial ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the assassination of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Many regard the assassination as Israel's lowest point in terms of divisions and incitement among the Israeli public, and worry that the dramatic events of the weekend foreshadow Israel's return to a similar period of internal strife. \"It was very sad to see how the internal discourse can bring about such potentially tragic outcome on a personal level,\" Plesner said. \"There's a way how to debate our differences in a democratic society.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597970","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:33:00-04:00","title":"Public health defends its time-tested approach against the rise of MAHA","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The American Public Health Association (APHA) is defending its evidence-based, systemic approach to public health against a rising political challenge from the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, led by health secretary Robert F.

But the current crisis hitting the field is different: \"I think public health is under attack by our own federal government more than anything else,\" he says. The Trump Administration is making deep cuts to staffing and funding for the existing health system, and at the same time, the Make America Healthy Again movement is on the rise. Under the leadership of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the movement aims to upend long-held norms in the health system, which Kennedy decries as \"corrupt.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       MAHA emphasizes tackling chronic diseases with a focus on individual medical choice and comes with headline grabbing, Instagram-famous leaders — and a set of solutions not based on the best available evidence, public health leaders say. Traditional public health, in contrast, has focused on systemic solutions to preventing both infectious and chronic disease.   More than 11,000 public health leaders and researchers convene this week to grapple with these changes, and defend their vision for America's health. The APHA's annual meeting, held in Washington, D.C. for the first time in over a decade, is taking a defiant stance. In an opening session titled \"Mission Possible\" focused on rebuilding the U.S. health system. \"This year's mission is clear,\" said the announcer in a movie-trailer style video introducing the event, \"Defend the integrity of public health. Protect vaccinations and immunization systems. Expose and resist political interference. And above all, never let fear win.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Participants flocked between call-to-action sessions such as \"Defending Science as a Higher National Value: A National Imperative\" and \"Attacks on Science and the Public's Health: How We Are Fighting Back,\" and others on more typical public health topics such as epidemiology, climate change and modernizing data collection. The meeting is scheduled to end with a \"Rally for the Public's Health\" on the National Mall Wednesday. Tearing down the system The Trump administration's policies are \"burning the health system to ash,\" said Benjamin, in his opening statements at the conference. In an interview, Benjamin elaborated. In addition to cutting staff and funding for public health, \"they are also taking apart health care financing and health insurance.\" \"They're undermining the core systems that we have for people to get good, solid medical care in our country,\" he adds.  White House policies  are also interrupting the pipeline for doctors and nurses, and changing tariff policies are making it harder to import drugs and new technologies, he says. \"The question is, three-and-a-half years from now, when the next administration comes in, how do we fix it?\" The good news, then, is that it provides a relatively blank slate on which to build a better health system, Benjamin says. But MAHA, supported by new institutions like the  MAHA Institute , a think tank founded earlier this year to influence federal policies, has its own vision for transforming public health. Their aims include \"cleaning up corruption in the health system and restoring the integrity of the public health and medical systems,\" according to MAHA Institute co-founder and co-president Mark Gorton. \"It's not that I'm saying we should utterly destroy public health, but we need to recenter it around truth,\" he says. Gorton is not a medical doctor. He founded the tech company LimeWire. He also started Tower Research Capital, an investment firm, and he's been a big supporter of Secretary Kennedy — or Bobby, as he calls him — for years. But Gorton says individuals can take responsibility for their own health. \"The fact that you have a government which thinks that it knows better than people themselves how best to take care of themselves, and that government bureaucrats are in a position to tell people what to do about their health is quite simply, I think, perverse,\" he says. In Gorton's opinion, the U.S. health system is \"a fear machine to market pharmaceutical products,\" the public health system \"has a long history of overhyping fake pandemics,\" and Americans would be healthier if they stopped drinking fluoridated water and getting vaccinated. Public health leaders say Gorton's assessment of public health measures is misinformed. \"The reason that most of us are alive long enough to be able to complain about public health is because of public health,\" says Benjamin with APHA. He notes that public health has saved millions of people from early deaths through improving sanitation, vaccination, and discouraging unhealthy behaviors like smoking. Understanding MAHA But public health leaders are listening to MAHA's critiques — and trying to find what common ground they can. \"MAHA doesn't come out of nowhere,\" says Dr. Carmen Nevarez, a longtime public health leader, and conference speaker. \"It comes out of people's lived realities, and circumstances where they felt that something was not addressed correctly.\" Health care costs are undeniably high in this country. The COVID pandemic years were hard and isolating for many people. And MAHA influencers are more interesting and fun to watch than traditional public health messaging, says Sarah Story, executive director of the Jefferson County, Colorado Health Department, who spoke on a panel titled \"Breaking the Mold: Bold Leaders Shaping the Future of Public Health\" at the conference. \"MAHA Moms are great at making life look effortless — they're attractive and fit and their houses are always clean,\" Story says. \"And they're successful at getting their message across because they've tapped into something that is true and valid, that parents are afraid of big corporations poisoning their children.\" The approach contrasts with traditional public health, which has been \"paternalistic for a couple of generations,\" Story says. \"We've been talking as if we're teaching people,\" which has been a turnoff to many. Public health's goals, of achieving optimal health for all, may seem to overlap with those of MAHA, but there are key differences, says Benjamin, of APHA: \"Our approach is more evidence-based than theirs.\" For example, Kennedy has raised alarm about  an unproven link  between Tylenol and autism and he  promoted vitamin A  as a broad-based treatment for measles. And while MAHA focuses on individual freedom, public health does occasionally limit it, says Nevarez. \"There's times when you have to say: sorry, you're not just a danger to yourself, you're a danger to others. And that's why we're going to limit your freedom.\" When she served as the health officer for the city of Berkeley, Calif., that work included measures like requiring someone with tuberculosis to get treated so they didn't infect others, or shutting down a restaurant with a rat infestation. \"If you live alone on an island, this is not your problem. If you live with neighbors and people in a city with you, it's your problem,\" Nevarez says. At this week's meeting, public health leaders are rallying for their own vision for protecting Americans' health. Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes to public health?

Who should you respond to first? How do you deal with a group chat that keeps popping off? What happens if you accidentally leave someone on read? These texting situations can be tricky, but managing them is a lot more straightforward than you might think, says Nick Leighton, host of the etiquette and manners podcast  Were You Raised by Wolves? . \"A lot of people forget that texting is just another form of communication,\" he says. \"But the principles of 'let's not waste people's time' and 'let's be mindful of their feelings' have never changed.\" Leighton and Erica Dhawan, author of  Digital Body Language: How to Build Trust and Connection, No Matter the Distance , explain how to apply the basic rules of etiquette to everyday texting — and they offer advice on five common texting conundrums. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I feel inundated by the volume of texts I receive in a day, so sometimes I don't respond to messages right away. Does that make me a bad texter?  \"We need to get over our reaction that everyone needs to respond immediately,\" says Dhawan, who wrote the popular  New York Times  essay \" Ignoring a text message or email isn't always rude. Sometimes it's necessary \" in 2022. The person on the receiving end could be \"with a screaming toddler, on the toilet, on a Zoom call.\" Dhawan says when we receive texts, we're kind of like emergency room doctors \"triaging on multiple levels\" to figure out what needs action first. Texts from, say, a day care teacher telling you that your child is sick, or a colleague saying a meeting is canceled, require an urgent response. Others, like a funny video or a party invitation with an RSVP deadline a month from now, not so much. So think about which messages could wait a day or two, or even a week. In turn, \"don't feel ghosted if someone doesn't respond immediately to you,\" she says. My sister texts me a lot of social media videos, like maybe five a day. I know this is her way of showing love, but I don't have time to watch them all. How should I handle this situation?  You don't need to watch or reply to every video in real time, Dhawan says. You might save all the videos to watch at the end of the day or week and send a reply then. And if you don't end up watching them, that's OK too. A simple \"love these,\" which acknowledges you received the videos, will suffice. \"This is your sister's texting love language, so remember what matters here.\" If you and your sister are close, you might tell her in a phone call, \"I love the videos, but it's a little overwhelming to get so many in the day,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I forgot to respond to a friend's text about getting lunch together about a month ago. And now I need to ask a huge favor from this person. What should I do?  \"We can't just go right into the ask,\" says Leighton. \"That's a little provocative.\" Instead, try something light and breezy like, \"Oh my goodness, I just realized I totally spaced out. I'd love to grab lunch with you. Let me know when you're free,\" he says. Then, you can send a follow-up text with your big ask. \"You're gonna have to set up that lunch though.\" How do I get someone who's unresponsive on text to message me back? I'm trying to plan a group outing to a concert, and it's time to buy the tickets.  Be direct, Dhawan says. \"When it comes to a decision text, we have to actually ask a specific question, like, 'Here are the tickets. I'm gonna buy them on Tuesday. Let me know today if you want me to buy you one.'\" Make sure it's clear that your message is asking a question and that a response is needed by a certain time. \"If they don't respond, let it go and move on,\" Dhawan says. My group chat is a mess. I have to scroll so far up to understand what the heck is going on. There are side conversations and random emojis and memes. How do I set some ground rules?  \"Etiquette is often about deciding which hill you want to die on,\" says Leighton. If there's a behavior in the group chat that is truly maddening, \"have a polite yet direct conversation.\" That said, there is such a thing as text etiquette in group chats, Dhawan says. Don't send unnecessary text messages, she says. \"Think before you ping. Take an extra breath and ask, 'Is this relevant?'\" Instead of sending a text message that says, \"ha ha ha,\" could you just double-tap and click the \"ha ha\" emoji, saving members of the group a notification? If you want to call someone out, do it privately on a separate text, Dhawan says. \"Take your drama to your one-on-one DMs. Remember that personal squabbles don't belong in the group.\" Don't forget to use your phone's messaging features to your benefit, she says. Mute chats to reduce notifications. Archive or exit chats to keep your threads tidy. Being in multiple group chats is like being in \"five different coffee chats at the exact same time. It can be overwhelming.\" The podcast episode was produced by Clare Marie Schneider. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane. The visual editor is Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Once we made it through breakfast, the daily Battle of Putting on Shoes was still ahead! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sometimes, I feel like I'm playing a game of emotional ping pong with my kid. And that can be hard for both me and him to manage. Fast-changing feelings and defiant behavior are developmentally appropriate for one to three year olds, says pediatric psychologist  Roger Harrison . They're a way of building your kid's sense of self — and understanding their place in the world. But for parents, they can often be a source of frustration, he says. When tantrums and power struggles arise from those emotions, it can be easy for us adults to lose our patience.  Reframing your toddler's boundary-pushing as a means of social and emotional learning might offer some relief, says Harrison, a division chief within the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"When we understand the 'why' of certain behaviors and place them within an appropriate developmental context, it allows parents to step back from the emotion and address the behavior strategically,\" he says. Harrison and other child development experts answer questions about common toddler behaviors — and offer advice on how to respond in the situation. Why does my toddler … say \"NO!\" to   everything, even to things they like?  A toddler's contrarian nature is just par for the course at this stage of development, says Harrison. In addition to developing more language and cognitive and motor skills at lightning speed, they're just beginning to understand that they are their own unique person separate from their caregivers. With this new awareness comes a need to test boundaries in order to establish independence. \"Part of that process of  figuring out who I am is to learn  me  in opposition to all the things in the world,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler gives you a resounding \"NO!\" to his favorite popsicle or book before bedtime, what he might be actually doing is trying to flex his newly discovered self-awareness. His \"no\" could translate to, \"Check this out, Mommy! I'm a person with my own mind and opinions now!\" ⭐  Parent tip:   What should you do if you need your child to say \"yes\" to, say, brushing their teeth, getting in their car seat or leaving the playground? Model a calm response, then kindly but firmly let them know what's going to happen next, says  Jamie Glowacki , a parenting and potty training coach and the   author of  Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler . You might say:  Yes, we do need to leave the playground. You can either go down the slide one more time and walk out with me, or I can carry you out right now.   Why does my toddler … say everything is \"mine\"? In Toddlerland, \"the rules of ownership are different,\" Harrison says. \"If it's mine, it's  mine . If it's yours and  I  want it, it's also mine.\" As a child starts to build their identity and independence, they'll often try to exert control over their environment through possession, Harrison says. It helps them understand themselves and their attachments in the world. For example: my mom has black hair, so I have black hair. My sister has a cool toy, so I have a cool toy.  I am a kid with black hair and a cool toy! Mine, mine, mine!   By making claims like these, a toddler can test the boundaries of their environment to better define who they are. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So if your toddler claims every book in the library is hers or refuses to share even her  least  favorite stuffie on her playdate — don't stress, says Harrison. She's not being selfish, she's just stretching out that newfound sense of self.  ⭐  Parent tip:  If you want your kid to share, model then practice the behavior, says early childhood educator  Chazz Lewis . For example, in the aftermath of a toy dispute with another child on the playground, teach your toddler to ask for a turn by reaching your palm out assertively and saying, \"turn, please,\" he says. Do a few practice rounds before sending them back out to play.  Why does my toddler … want to lick/smash/crash into everything? Does your little one love to spill every container they can get their hands on, lick colorful wallpaper or bounce against your living room like it's a life-size pinball machine? They may simply be trying to gain some sensory information about their surroundings, says  Layne Deyling Cherland , a longtime preschool teacher-turned-content creator who focuses on adult-toddler dynamics. To them, every action and interaction is a chance to gather more data about themselves and how things work. \"What's me and what's not me? What effect do I have on the world? That's what all this experimenting is,\" says Deyling Cherland. They may also be craving proprioceptive input, like the deep pressure gained from tight hugs or the strength-building from climbing on playground equipment, she says.  Toddlers crave these types of sensory experiences in part because it builds up their internal sense of position and movement, which is important for coordination, balance and even self-regulation. ⭐  Parent tip :   As long as she's safe, let your little one explore, says Deyling Cherland. Embracing weirdness or silliness can be an opportunity for connection and a key to disrupting power struggles.  Make an obstacle course with pillows and stuffies to get those zoomies out, then race through it together. Dole out some new or favorite snacks into separate bowls and have your picky eater play a game of blind taste-testing. Why does my toddler … keep doing that thing I told them not to do 100 times? No running in the kitchen! I said, don't run in the kitchen! You have 10 seconds to stop running in the kitchen or you're in big trouble, missy!  If you're repeating yourself a bunch with your toddler, you've likely already lost control of the situation, says Glowacki. From a comprehension standpoint, your average toddler doesn't yet grasp the concept of negation, Lewis says. So when you say  don't  run in the kitchen, what your child is more likely to understand from that sentence is:  run  in the kitchen. More importantly, simply telling a kid what you  don't  want them to do doesn't give them any tools for how to behave successfully in the future, he says. ⭐  Parent tip:  Instead of telling your toddler what they're doing  wrong , teach them how to solve the problem or what they should do instead, says Lewis. If you want your kid to stop running in the kitchen, you might say, \"walk slowly in the kitchen.\" Or maybe, \"please walk slowly and gently on the tile floor so you don't hurt yourself.\" \"Now, there's a chance they might actually do something different this time,\" Lewis says. Why does my toddler … hate switching activities? Wake up! Change clothes! Eat breakfast!   Toddlers are bossed around all day long, often with little understanding and even less say in their daily schedule. While toddlers thrive on routine and consistency, transitioning from one task to another can be frustrating, Glowacki says. The break in continuity can be unsettling, especially when they're immersed in an activity that gives them a sense of comfort and independence, like playtime or bath time. Those moments are also one of the very few pieces of the world she can exert any agency over, so that loss of control can feel acute. Add to that hunger, sleepiness, overstimulation — daily factors that would stress out any other human — and those transition periods can become triggers for volatile emotions and tantrums, she says. ⭐  Parent tip:    The next time your little one throws a fit about transitioning from playtime to dinnertime, try to remember that the change is huge for her, says Glowacki. Put a little power back into her hands by offering two positive choices, Lewis says. For example: Blue plate or purple plate? Juice or milk? This gives her agency but allows you to safely steer her where she needs to go.  \"The goal of toddlerhood is to give a child manageable pieces of personal power to practice with,\" Deyling Cherland says. \"We want them to have practiced enough so that when they are this young adult going out into the world, they know, 'This is how I make decisions. My decisions do affect other people.' \" The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan. We'd love to hear from you.

Life Kit \n        \n           Updated Monday, May 12, 2025 • 10:19 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Sept. 6, 2024, and has been updated.  How do you save money on groceries? We posed this question to our audience after  we published an episode on the topic  with Beth Moncel, founder of the cooking blog  Budget Bytes . She advised shoppers to  look up weekly deals ,  be wary of bulk buying  and stick to the grocery list.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       We received over 50 more money-saving tips from our listeners, ranging from the practical (check your receipt for errors) to the creative (use artificial intelligence to create recipes with ingredients you already have at home).  Here's a selection of their responses. They have been edited for length and clarity. For more tips, listen to the podcast episode in the player above.  Stay close to home If you must visit multiple stores, make sure they are close to your home or else the gas expense will eat away at the money saved at the store. —  Manuel Ramos Check your receipt Check the receipt before you leave the parking lot. If you find an error, which mostly happens on sale items, you can get a refund right away. If you don't check until you get home, you're more likely to let it go. — Lisa Gluskin Ask about senior discounts I'm a senior, so I try to shop on senior discount days and save 5%. The stores don't advertise this, but if you Google it or ask about it at the customer service desk, you can find out what day of the week they do this.  It varies by store . — Elyce O'Malley Cook with whole turkey and chicken  When I buy meat, I buy whole turkey and chicken. Both are cheaper by the pound, and the latter is so easy to make in a slow or pressure cooker. I'll also buy special meats after the holidays. You can buy spiral hams and whole turkeys for cheap after Easter and Thanksgiving. — Vanessa Reed \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Buy inexpensive cuts of meat If your dish is going to cook for a long time, the exact cut of beef may be unimportant. So I use the least expensive roast in the store. At the usual one-hour cooking time, it may be a little tough, but add an extra 40 minutes and it will turn out great. — Joseph Bean Process your own food  Pop your own corn. Roast chickpeas by buying them dry, soaking them overnight and putting them into a low-temperature oven. Buy large containers of plain yogurt, divide them up and add spices, a little jam or other flavors. — Eve Elzenga Get a little help from AI I recently started using ChatGPT to help use up food in the kitchen. For example, this weekend, I had a tomato, some bell peppers, half an onion, a half dozen sweet potatoes, broccoli and leftover roasted chicken in the fridge.  I told ChatGPT I wanted to make something for breakfast and dinner using these ingredients. The tomato, peppers and onion went into egg cups — breakfast for the week — and the potatoes, broccoli and chicken became twice-baked stuffed sweet potatoes for dinner. Both were delicious, and I'll enjoy them this coming week too! — Chris Brainard Make your own bread Learn how to make bread. This saves a ton of money, and you can occasionally supplement with store-bought bread if needed. About $8 worth of ingredients makes about eight to ten loaves of basic sandwich-style bread. It doesn't have preservatives, so freeze what you can't use in a week. — Tracey Rocco Flip the script (and cook creatively)  Instead of planning a meal and then buying overpriced ingredients, try flipping the script. Buy what's on sale and plan your meal around that.  In addition, have a few meal options for each type of protein that include a variety of flavors and different cooking methods. For example, you probably wouldn't want to eat deep-fried food three days in a row. If spareribs are on sale, I'll buy them and make either deep-fried salt and pepper spareribs, braised Filipino adobo, grilled hoisin spareribs or Japanese curry. If ground beef is on sale, I'll make fried smash burgers or Japanese hamburger steak. — Mark Hagiwara  Grow your own herbs and veggies  Grow higher-priced items that you buy frequently, like rosemary and basil. Fresh herbs are often $2 to $3 for a small bunch — about the same price as a packet of seeds. Or save a few sprigs from that bunch of herbs and root them in water then plant them. I have a basil plant in a pot that I started two years ago.  Cherry tomatoes are also more expensive to buy but they're one of the easiest types of tomatoes to grow at home. — Katherine MacKinnon This story was written by Malaka Gharib.

Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 4:40 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         As the controversy over funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown dragged on in recent days, the top official in charge of the program pivoted to a new talking point, calling the program that some 42 million Americans rely on \"corrupt.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins described SNAP at a recent press conference as \"so bloated, so broken, so dysfunctional, so corrupt that it is astonishing when you dig in.\" The message came as headlines highlighted  food banks warning of an impending crisis  as money ran out over the weekend for SNAP recipients. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration  announced Monday  it would partially restore some federal food assistance payments after being ordered by two federal judges to do so, but warned they would be delayed. Rollins  asserted on X on Sunday  that an unprecedented and controversial data demand her agency made to states earlier this year had revealed troubling things about SNAP. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered states to turn over  the personal data of all SNAP recipients  over the last five years, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and addresses. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"[W]e told every state to send us their SNAP data so we could make sure illegal immigrants aren't getting benefits meant for American families,\" Rollins wrote. \"In just the states that cooperated, we've already uncovered massive fraud,\" the post continues. \"The Democrat Party has turned its back on working Americans and built its entire strategy around protecting illegal aliens. They know if the handouts stop, those illegals will go back home, and Democrats will lose 20+ seats after the next census.\" Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for SNAP benefits and never have been. Only certain categories of lawfully present noncitizens are eligible for the program, and state officials verify their status during the application process using a federal data system. Parents of U.S. citizens can sign their kids up regardless of their own immigration status. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most states with Democratic governors have refused to turn over their SNAP recipients' data to USDA, citing federal privacy laws. A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the USDA from withholding funding from states that do not comply and  ruled last month  that states were likely to prove the data demand was not lawful. NPR reporting last month found that  at least 27 mostly Republican states  did turn over data for millions of people to USDA. (Rollins has since said 29 states had turned over their data, though a USDA spokesperson acknowledged she had mistakenly identified Colorado as a state that had given data.) In an  appearance on Fox News on Sunday , Rollins elaborated on what she said the states' SNAP data revealed. \"We have found thousands and thousands of illegal use of the EBT card,\" Rollins said, referring to the electronic benefit transfer cards used by SNAP recipients. \"We have been moving people off of SNAP. We've got almost 700,000 people, I think we've moved off just since the president took office. We've arrested about 118 people.\" She added, \"We found one guy in six different states getting a benefit. We found about 5,000 people that are dead who are still getting benefits.\" People with experience analyzing SNAP and other safety net programs say such statistics need more detail and context about how they were calculated to be evaluated. \"We have real questions about how they've arrived at these numbers,\" said Nicole Schneidman, an attorney with the nonprofit, Protect Democracy. Schneidman represents SNAP recipients and hunger and privacy groups who sued over USDA's data demand to states. \"One thing that's really important for people to keep in mind is that 42 million people across the country receive SNAP on a monthly basis. And so these numbers that are being referenced are trivial in the grand scheme of the millions of people across the country who are receiving SNAP,\" Schneidman said. Tracy Roof, a political scientist at the University of Richmond, pointed out that Rollins asserted she had removed 700,000 people from the program, but did not specify why. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If they're only arresting a little over 100 people, then clearly a lot of those 700,000 people are not committing fraud,\" Roof said. \"They are probably people being removed from the rolls because of recent legislative changes.\" Deep cuts that Congress approved to SNAP  earlier this year mean that some people are no longer eligible for the program, such as certain categories of lawfully present noncitizens. And while Rollins has suggested there was something suspicious about the fact that SNAP has expanded in recent years, Root said the reason is \"because of the high prices for food and the fact that a lot of people just can't stretch their dollars from their incomes enough to be able to feed their families.\" Some in the pro-Trump media space  quickly reported  that Rollins had found  huge numbers  of undocumented immigrants enrolled in SNAP, even though she did not explicitly make that claim. The host of Fox and Friends, Rachel Campos-Duffy, claimed, without evidence, that \"20% of illegals are on SNAP\" in a question to Rollins. The narrative fits into a larger rhetorical strategy by the Trump administration, said Roof. \"The same thing is being done with Medicaid to say that Democrats are trying to provide coverage to all these illegal immigrants, which it's not,\" Roof said. The USDA did not respond to a request for more information about the agency's findings in the state data, including whether it had identified ineligible immigrants improperly receiving SNAP benefits. Even before Rollins' latest comments, right-wing influencers have been promoting  false claims about immigrants accessing SNAP on social media. Noncitizens account for less than five percent of SNAP beneficiaries, according to USDA data from 2023. \"Immigrants who are eligible take up SNAP at lower rates than U.S.-born people,\" said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. program at Migration Policy Institute. Gelatt said participation rates are especially low for eligible members in mixed status families. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The USDA is verifying the citizenship or immigration status of all SNAP recipients whose data they receive from states, according to the USDA's filings in federal court. The agency is using a federal data system known as SAVE that the Trump administration has turned into a  citizenship look up tool  by linking various data sets for the first time. USDA has not yet revealed the findings of its SAVE checks. Protect Democracy's Nicole Schneidman said she had concerns at the outset of USDA's data collection from states that it could be used to bolster an inaccurate narrative about fraud to justify shrinking the program. \"These claims, and the strategy of trying to undermine the caliber of a fundamental social safety net in this country, is exactly what we always feared would transpire should they receive this data from the states and manipulate it for these kinds of ends,\" Schneidman said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   A federal court has restored some of those federal benefits for food, known as SNAP, that were cut during the government shutdown. It comes as top Trump officials have started claiming the entire program is corrupt. NPR's Jude Joffe-Block reports. JUDE JOFFE-BLOCK, BYLINE: Over the past few days, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins has started pushing the message that federal food aid is filled with fraud. Here she is on Fox News on Sunday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BROOKE ROLLINS: We sent letters to every governor in America, being very clear that no illegal aliens can use SNAP - zero, zero, zero. JOFFE-BLOCK: But people in the country illegally have never been eligible for SNAP. In that same interview, Rollins spoke about USDA's controversial demand that states turn over the personal data of all SNAP recipients. Multiple lawsuits have challenged that demand. But nearly 30 - mostly Republican - states did turn over data for millions of people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROLLINS: We have found thousands and thousands of illegal use of the EBT card. We have been moving people off of SNAP. We've got almost 700,000 people, I think, we've moved off just since the president took office. We've arrested about 118 people. JOFFE-BLOCK: Some in the pro-Trump media space quickly reported that the alleged fraud was committed by immigrants in the country illegally. Rollins didn't actually make that specific claim, though she alluded to it on X. Tracy Roof says this is part of a larger rhetorical strategy by the Trump administration. TRACY ROOF: I mean, the same thing is being done with Medicaid to say that Democrats are trying to provide coverage to all these illegal immigrants, which it's not. JOFFE-BLOCK: Roof studies SNAP as a political scientist at the University of Richmond. While Rollins has suggested there's something suspicious about SNAP's expansion in recent years, Roof says it's actually because... ROOF: The high prices for food and the fact that a lot of people just can't stretch the dollars from their incomes enough to be able to feed their families. JOFFE-BLOCK: Roof also says the number Rollins gave need a lot more context. For example, the 700,000 people who were taken off the program may no longer be eligible due to Congress' recent cuts to SNAP. Jude Joffe-Block, NPR News.

Spanberger, who previously served three terms in the U.S. House, defeated her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. She'll be Virginia's first woman governor. The contest received national attention as one of the  first major tests of voter sentiment  in  response to the Trump administration's  policies. Virginia is home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors. On the campaign trail, Spanberger argued that federal layoffs, cutbacks by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tariffs and the federal shutdown were an  attack on the Virginia economy  — and pitched herself as a way for voters to push back. \"We need a governor who will recognize the hardship of this moment, advocate for Virginians, and make clear that not only are we watching people be challenged in their livelihoods and in their businesses and in communities, but Virginia's economy is under attack,\" Spanberger said at a stop on a campaign bus tour late last month. That message resonated with Haley Morgan Wright, a voter whose husband is a federal employee currently working without pay during the federal shutdown. She wants Spanberger to use her platform as governor to uplift the stories of civil servants like him. \"He cares about his country, he wants to serve his country and has opted to do it in this way,\" she said after casting a ballot in the Northern Virginia exurbs. \"He's not superfluous.\" Spanberger was backed by national Democrats National Democrats had looked to Spanberger and Virginia Democrats for a boost heading into the 2026 midterms. Former President Barack Obama had campaigned for her and the party backed her in what was one of just two governor's races this year. \"The DNC has been spending a lot of money and a lot of time in Virginia,\" said DNC Vice Chair Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta at a meeting for party volunteers in Northern Virginia. \"Because we know that what you all do and the momentum that is going to come out of your victories is going lead to us flipping the House of Representatives in 2026.\" In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote to 48.7%. Virginia governors are limited to one four-year term. Spanberger, who served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, has cultivated a reputation as a pragmatic centrist. The theme of her run for governor was \"affordability\" — speaking to Virginians' concerns about rising costs of housing, utility bills, pharmaceutical drugs and the economic uncertainty she blamed on Trump's tariffs and federal layoffs. Earle-Sears, meanwhile, portrayed herself as an example of the American dream — a Jamaican immigrant who became a U.S. Marine and small business owner. She accused Spanberger of backing policies on transgender rights that she said are a threat to girls' safety in school bathrooms and locker rooms.  \"Love is not having my daughter having to be forced to undress in a locker room with a man. That's not love,\" Earle-Sears said at a rally in late October. \"Love is making sure that our girl children have opportunities in sports and are not forced to play against biological males.\" Earle-Sears' stance on transgender students in girls' bathrooms sounded good to Elizabeth Drake, a voter who said she works with youth at a church in Loudoun County. \"I feel like we're actually going back and setting ourselves back a lot by endangering women,\" she said. \"I'm not saying that that doesn't mean we can have alternative spaces for people, but the women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's safe homes are not it.\" The race was jolted by late-breaking events Earle-Sears also attacked Spanberger for supporting Biden administration policies. She vowed to continue business-friendly polices of outgoing Gov. Youngkin. While she backed Trump's policies, Trump did not endorse her. Several developments  impacted the final weeks of the race. The federal shutdown shadowed the final month of early voting, with both campaigns blaming the other party for the stalemate.  Virginia lawmakers began considering a plan to redistrict the state's congressional districts to favor Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections, as Trump pushes Republicans in other states to move to favor their candidates. That could be an issue facing the next Virginia governor. And Republicans seized on revelations of text messages by Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, in which he described the hypothetical shooting of a Republican lawmaker. Spanberger denounced the messages though Earle-Sears faulted her for not calling on Jones to drop out of the race. Despite the scandal, Jones defeated incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, according to an Associated Press race call. His victory in the key legal post will enable the commonwealth to participate in the torrent of blue-state lawsuits against the Trump administration.

products kills 6, hospitalizes 25 \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 2:28 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A deadly listeria outbreak connected to prepared pasta meals sold at grocery chains nationwide is worsening, federal health officials say. As of late October, the outbreak has killed six people and sickened 27, all but two of whom were hospitalized,  according to last week's update  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One of those affected was a pregnant mother, resulting in a fetal loss. Cases have been reported in 18 states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Since the last CDC case count update on September 25, 2025, a total of 7 new illnesses from 3 states have been reported, with 2 additional deaths reported,\" the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said . That list has grown in recent months. The outbreak started in June, when listeria concerns prompted recalls of several brands of ready-to-eat chicken  fettuccine Alfredo meals made by FreshRealm Inc. and sold under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart. In response, FreshRealm began testing some of its pasta samples — and in mid-September, they came back positive for listeria. Further genetic testing confirmed it was the same strain of listeria that was detected in FreshRealm's previously recalled chicken Alfredo meal, the FDA said at the time. That discovery prompted the recall of two more products with specific use-by dates in late September and early October: Marketside Linguine With Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce, sold at Walmart, and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. They shared a pasta supplier, Nate's Fine Foods. The company supplies precooked pasta and grains to the wholesale food service and restaurant industries, according to its website. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In late September, Nate's further expanded its recall to include other batches of precooked pasta \"including fettucine, linguine, and farfalle (bowtie), after a sample of linguine pasta collected and tested by FreshRealm tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes,\"  the FDA said . Early October  saw the recalls  of several more pre-made pasta salads and heat-and-eat noodle dishes sold at Trader Joe's, Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart, Giant Eagle and Sprouts locations across the country. In a late  September statement , Nate's said it was recalling the products out of an \"abundance of caution\" and apologized for any concern it had caused. \"Our top priority is ensuring the safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps until this matter is resolved,\" it said, adding that it is working closely with the CDC, FDA and state health officials to identify the source. The  FDA says  it is working with Nate's to determine if additional recalls are needed. Health officials say customers who purchased any of these meals should throw them away, and clean their refrigerators, containers and any surfaces that may have come into contact with the food. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At this point, the products that were recalled between June and October are more likely to be in customers' fridges and freezers than on store shelves. Most of them had use-by dates earlier than Oct. 10. The  recalled product  with the longest shelf life is a frozen meal, Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls. Those dishes, which were distributed to wholesale distributors and operators nationwide, have best-by dates in March 2027. A spokesperson for the company told NPR that retailers have removed the product from their shelves. What to know — and do — about listeria Listeria infection, or listeriosis, is most likely to sicken pregnant people and newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. Pregnant people may only experience mild symptoms like fever, fatigue and muscle aches, but should be aware that listeria could cause miscarriages, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of their newborn. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal issues, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance. They usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food but could start as soon as the same day or as late as 10 weeks later, the CDC says. It can be hard to confirm the scope of an outbreak, since some people recover from the infection without medical care. For those who do require medical attention, the CDC says it usually takes three to four weeks to determine whether their illness is part of an outbreak. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The CDC says it has interviewed 13 of the people who got sick as of late September. Seven of them reported eating precooked meals before their illness started, and four specifically mentioned eating chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The CDC and FDA say consumers should contact their health care provider to report any symptoms of listeriosis and receive care. They can also report any adverse health effects  to the FDA online . The U.S. has seen a number of listeria outbreaks in the past year. A 2024 outbreak tied to deli meat left 10 people dead and dozens more hospitalized across the country. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in January blamed \" inadequate sanitation practices \" at a since-closed Boar's Head facility in Virginia and listed  several steps  it would take to better protect the public from listeria. In February, nearly two million  baked goods  — including some donuts sold at Dunkin' — were recalled over listeria concerns. That same month,  frozen shakes  sold to nursing homes and long-term care facilities were recalled in connection with a listeria outbreak dating back to 2018. The  FDA says  that outbreak sickened 42 people and killed 14 — across 21 states — before authorities declared it over in May. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598290","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:56:00.000Z","title":"Teen Vogue Moving Under Vogue.com, Staff Laid Off","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Teen Vogue is being restructured under the Vogue.com umbrella as part of Condé Nast’s strategy to unify its digital content ecosystem.

The article chronicles his journey from a modest upbringing in Nebraska to a powerful role in shaping national security and foreign policy. As George W. Bush’s vice president, Cheney became a dominant force in the White House, advocating for a strong executive branch and a preemptive foreign policy that culminated in the Iraq War. Though praised for his loyalty and experience, he faced intense criticism for promoting war, secrecy, and authoritarian tactics. Personal controversies, including a heart attack, a shooting incident with a friend, and a political scandal involving his chief of staff, further complicated his legacy. After leaving office, Cheney remained a vocal critic of the Obama and Trump administrations, especially in his public denunciation of Trump as a threat to the republic.

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. Cheney had dealt with a history of heart problems. \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\" In a statement, former President George W. Bush, who picked Cheney as his vice president, said the death \"is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was.\" Bush added that Cheney \"was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An inauspicious beginning There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood. But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin. While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — this one in Iraq. Ordinary to extraordinary The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House. Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34. It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam. \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       War, a recurring theme In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush.  This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision. \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\" Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Changing the vice presidency — and foreign policy The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney. In office, Cheney became a lightning rod for critics of the administration. Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House.  The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's  Meet the Press , Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House. \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,'\" Cheney said, adding that \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy. On  Meet the Press , Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle. \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said. As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that his views had changed from his earlier days in politics. Controversy follows Cheney While Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year. \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well, I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\" There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high-ranking an official as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest with birdshot pellets during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch. Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News. On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Barack Obama was sworn in. Out of office, he emerged as a frequent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, even accusing the president of not understanding that the U.S. was at war. In February 2010 he made a surprise appearance at CPAC, the conservative political action conference in Washington. The crowd erupted. It was one of the last moments of big public adulation for Cheney. With the rise of Donald Trump, Cheney's brand of politics and his interventionist foreign policy fell out of favor in the party. Trump would often lambaste Cheney for launching what he called \"forever wars.\" It carried into the next generation as Trump attacked Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), when she voted for Trump's impeachment after a riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Trumps relentless criticism of her contributed to Liz Cheney's defeat when she ran for reelection in 2022. Along the way, her feather appeared in television spots on her behalf. \"In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in the ad. It was his last big public moment in the political arena. Two years later, he would endorse Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump for president. In the end, the power of the Cheney name was greatly diminished in GOP politics. His legacy became one of contradictions: Trump supporters despised him, while some Democrats embraced him — if reluctantly — and still many others would always condemn him as a war criminal for his role in Iraq. Now Cheney has died, with a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government. No matter his contradictory legacy, he leaves behind a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Former Vice President Dick Cheney has died. He was 84 years old. The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, that according to a statement from his family. NPR's Don Gonyea has this look at his life and career. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: There was little in the early life of Dick Cheney to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University, work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunk driving convictions and it's an inauspicious young adulthood. But turn it around, Cheney did - marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynne, two children, a college degree. The future vice president began his political career as a congressional fellow in 1969, which led to a job with the future partner in the Bush administration, Donald Rumsfeld, who at the time ran an economics office in the Richard Nixon White House. Cheney left the Nixon administration before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974, he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GERALD FORD: Our Constitution works. Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. GONYEA: Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34. It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush, a belief that the power of the presidency was being eroded and must be protected and restored. In the '70s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam. In 2002, he talked about that in an interview with Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DICK CHENEY: We've seen the War Powers Act and Anti-Impoundment Control Act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job. We're not going to do that in this administration. GONYEA: After Ford was defeated in the 1976 election, in '78, Dick Cheney ran for Congress from Wyoming and won. That was also the year that he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade, leaving to become secretary of defense for President George H. W. Bush. That's when he had his first confrontation with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Operation Desert Storm in 1991. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST: Holy cow. That was a large airburst that we saw. It was filling the sky. GONYEA: The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should just continue all the way to Baghdad and topple the government of Saddam. But President Bush said no. In 1991, Secretary of Defense Cheney defended that decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHENEY: The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire. GONYEA: Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost his reelection bid to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own, but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company, Halliburton. The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. And in 2000, he was asked by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate, leading to this surprise announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE W BUSH: So I'm proud to announce that Dick Cheney, a man of great integrity, sound judgment and experience, is my choice to be the next vice president of the United States. GONYEA: In office, Cheney became a lightning rod for administration critics as he redefined the office of the vice president, becoming President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics allege that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House, reinforcing that with the terror attacks of 9/11, 2001. After 9/11, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy, where potential threats would be met with preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq war with dire warnings to the American people, even as he predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy. And this from NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") TIM RUSSERT: Do you think the American people are prepared for a long, costly and bloody battle with significant American casualties? CHENEY: I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators. GONYEA: But the war dragged on, and Democrats seized on that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk of how he had changed from his earlier days in politics. And while Dick Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUSH: I was asking him what costume he was planning. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: He said, well, I'm already wearing it. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: And then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force. (LAUGHTER) GONYEA: In retirement, Cheney had another heart attack and received a heart transplant. And he watched his party change dramatically with the rise of Donald Trump, who both reviled and ridiculed Cheney's traditional conservative politics and interventionist worldview. Trump also targeted Cheney's daughter, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who supported Trump's second impeachment after pro-Trump rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Trump's relentless criticism of her resulted in Liz Cheney's defeat when she ran for reelection in 2022, but along the way, her father appeared in the following TV spots on her behalf. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHENEY: In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election, using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected it. GONYEA: In the end, the power of the Cheney name was greatly diminished in GOP politics. His legacy became one of contradictions. Trump's supporters despised him, while some Democrats embraced him, if reluctantly, and still many others would always condemn him as a war criminal for his role in Iraq, all of which spoke to the unusually large footprint he left as an occupant of the vice presidency.

But Adams — made famous first by his long-running Dilbert cartoon, and later for  a racist rant  on  YouTube  — counts some powerful people in his social media circle: President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. So Adams posted his complaint on X, saying Kaiser of Northern California, his health insurer and care provider, had \"dropped the ball\" in scheduling a procedure needed to treat  his metastatic prostate cancer.  Adams wrote he was going to ask Trump to help save his life, and he added: \"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Donald Trump Jr.  responded to the post on X first , saying: \"Going to make sure that my dad sees this.\" Just after 11 am on Sunday morning,  Kennedy responded , saying, \"Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\" Later that day, President Trump  posted a screen shot of Adams' original post and responded   \"On it!\" on his favored social media platform, Truth Social. And on Monday, Adams posted that he  had an appointment  to receive the infusion he needed of the cancer drug, Pluvicto, on Tuesday. \"For context, I waited months for the drug, like everyone else,\" Adams wrote. \"But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected. Not sure.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The U.S. health care system is notoriously complex, confusing and expensive, and many Americans have had similarly frustrating experiences as Adams did. Few, though, have the social media reach to enlist such powerful helping hands. \"Our health system shouldn't be one where we need the intervention of the president or the HHS secretary to weigh in on behalf of a high-profile political backer,\" said Anthony Wright, the executive director of  Families USA , a health care advocacy organization. Wright added that he is gratified Adams got the help he needed and said it should be available to all. \"Glad the President is offering to do casework,\" Wright said, noting that federal workers who do similar problem solving have been fired and navigators who help people sign up for Affordable Care Act health insurance have been cut by 90%. Wright also called out the\" \" current shutdown over the issue of tax credits  that help millions access and afford health care.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       NPR reached out to Kaiser for comment and they e-mailed this statement: \"Mr. Adams' oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway. Since it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente's nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\" Adams' experience drummed up a chorus of well-wishes online, as well as those who called out the preferential treatment he apparently got. \"There are Americans all over America who are currently going through similar circumstances,\" wrote  one X poster , responding to Kennedy's offer to help Adams. Another responded : \"How about promoting UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, like the rest of the Industrialized 1st World Nations, so EVERYONE can be treated, not just Celebrity & the Wealthy?\" In the shutdown health care fight that started Oct. 1, about 24 million Americans who buy their insurance on the ACA marketplaces will see their premiums skyrocket — the average plan  will double  in price — if Congress doesn't act. Democrats say they will not reopen the government unless the tax subsidies that bring down the cost are renewed. Republicans say they will not discuss renewing the subsidies until the government is reopened. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/getty-stability-ai-image-copyright-trademark-fa2c561a33c7b6714a7657255a3fbdf1","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:57:48+00:00","title":"Stability AI Wins Copyright Ruling in British Court Battle with Getty Images","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark British court case, Stability AI narrowly won its copyright defense against Getty Images, which accused it of infringing copyright and trademark by training its Stable Diffusion AI model on 12 million images from Getty’s library.

2025-11-04T11:57:48+00:00\n\nLONDON (AP) — Artificial intelligence company Stability AI mostly prevailed against Getty Images Tuesday in a British court battle over intellectual property . Seattle-based Getty had accused Stability AI of infringing its copyright and trademark by scraping 12 million images from its website, without permission, to train its popular image generator, Stable Diffusion. The closely followed case at Britain’s High Court was among the first in a wave of lawsuits involving generative AI as movie studios, authors and artists challenged tech companies’ use of their works to train AI chatbots. Tech companies have long argued that “fair use” or “fair dealing” legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Tuesday’s ruling provides some clarity but still leaves big unanswered questions over copyright and AI, experts said. According to the judge’s written ruling, Getty narrowly won its argument that Stability had infringed its trademark, but lost the rest of its case. Both sides claimed victory. “This is a significant win for intellectual property owners,” Getty Images said in a statement.

Getty had accused Stability of both primary and secondary copyright infringement. Legal experts said the first one involves the act of reproducing something without permission — similar to a dodgy factory churning out counterfeit Chanel handbags or pirated CDs — while the second involves importing those copies from another country. In this case, Getty said Stability’s use of its image library to train and develop Stable Diffusion’s AI model amounted to breach of primary copyright. Stability responded that the case doesn’t belong in the United Kingdom because the AI model’s training technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon. During the three-week trial in June, Getty dropped its primary copyright allegations, in a sign that it didn’t think they would succeed. But it still pursued the secondary infringement claims. Even if Stability’s AI training happened outside the U.K., Getty said offering the Stable Diffusion service to British users amounted to importing unlawful copies of its images into the country. Justice Joanna Smith rejected Getty’s claims, ruling that Stable Diffusion’s AI didn’t infringe copyright because it doesn’t “store or reproduce any Copyright Works (and has never done so).” Getty also sued for trademark infringement because its watermark appeared on some of the images generated by Stability’s chatbot. The judge sided with Getty but added that the case only partially succeeded, and that her findings are “both historic and extremely limited in scope.” “While I have found instances of trademark infringement, I have been unable to determine that these were widespread,” she said. Experts said Getty’s move to drop part of its copyright case means AI training is still in legal limbo. “The decision leaves the U.K. without a meaningful verdict on the lawfulness of an AI model’s process of learning from copyright materials,” said Iain Connor, an intellectual property partner at law firm Michelmores. Smith said there was “very real societal importance” in deciding how to strike a balance between the creative and tech industries. But she added that the court can only rule on the “diminished” case that remained and couldn’t consider “issues that have been abandoned.” A Getty spokeswoman declined to say whether there would be an appeal. Getty is also pursuing a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States against Stability. It originally sued in 2023 but refiled the case in a San Francisco federal court in August. The Getty lawsuits are among a slew of cases that highlight how the generative AI boom is fueling a clash between tech companies and creative industries. AI companies are now fighting more than 50 copyright lawsuits — so many that a tech industry lobby group has called on President Donald Trump for help stop the court fights, saying they threaten AI innovation. Among the cases, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by authors while a federal judge dismissed a similar lawsuit from 13 authors against Meta Platforms. Warner Bros. has sued Midjourney for copyright infringement, as have Disney and Universal in seperate lawsuits, alleging that its image generator creates copyrighted characters. ___ AP Technology Writer Matt O’Brien contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5592061","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:42:00-05:00","title":"Some heavy hitters — John Irving and Salman Rushdie among them — have new books out","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A literary roundup features six new books by acclaimed authors, including John Irving’s *Queen Esther*, a return to his beloved Maine orphanage setting with a new Jewish orphan protagonist; Kevin Moffett’s debut *Only Son*, a meditative and emotionally resonant work of short vignettes; Salman Rushdie’s *The Eleventh Hour*, a post-2022 attack release exploring identity and death; Oyinkan Braithwaite’s *Cursed Daughters*, a darkly comic exploration of generational trauma; Bryan Washington’s *Palaver*, a National Book Award finalist on complex family dynamics; and Andrew Miller’s Booker Prize shortlisted *The Land in Winter*, a lively, character-driven novel set during a harsh winter in 1960s England.

This time the star is the eponymous Esther Nacht, a Jewish orphan whose unconventional arc leads a story that's unmistakably Irving — amiably peopled, compellingly plotted and, above all, compassionate for its characters. Only Son , by Kevin Moffett Moffett's debut novel follows the arc of his narrator – an only son, natch – from the childhood loss of his father, through a complicated relationship with his mother, to an adulthood as the father of an only son himself. Of course, that plot summary does little justice to this slim suburban Buddha of a book, which is composed of a series of short vignettes that are so simple, subtle and occasionally destabilizing, they almost resemble zen koans — though no koan has ever, like  Only Son , also had me tearing up or giggling enough to alarm passersby. The Eleventh Hour: A Quintet of Stories , by Salman Rushdie It's hard not to view every new book by Rushdie as a precious gift, after a  stabbing attack in 2022  very nearly ended the celebrated septuagenarian's career — and his life. Now,  just months after the sentencing  of the man who tried to kill him, Rushdie's name again adorns a new book, this one a collection of unconnected short stories that straddle the Atlantic and brim with big ideas about identity, revenge and death. Cursed Daughters , by Oyinkan Braithwaite Braithwaite gets right to the point. The Nigerian novelist's darkly comic debut,  My Sister, the Serial Killer ,  dealt with exactly that ; and you can guess the premise of her sophomore effort,  Cursed Daughters . The curse, a punishment for the matriarch's adultery, dooms the romantic relationships of her female descendants, including young Ebun. Or does it? You didn't expect things to  stay  straightforward, did you? \"This is a curse, this exists,\"  she told NPR's  Weekend Edition ,  but \"I was also approaching it from the perspective of generational trauma and what that looks like … and also this idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Palaver , by Bryan Washington \"Washington is an enormously gifted author,\" reviewer Michael Schaub  wrote for NPR in 2020 , \"and his writing — spare, unadorned, but beautiful — reads like the work of a writer who's been working for decades, not one who has yet to turn 30.\" Five years on,  the novelist  — now a truly geriatric 32 years old — has only refined his keen eye for complicated family dynamics. In this  National Book Award finalist , it's a complicated mother-son relationship that takes center stage, as the estranged pair find themselves suddenly in close proximity, grasping for understanding half a world away from home. The Land in Winter , by Andrew Miller For a pithy pitch for Miller's latest novel, I defer to the judges who  put it on this year's Booker Prize shortlist . \"It's a joy to read, a nerve-shredding pleasure,\"  they effused about the book , which follows a pair of expectant couples forced to hunker down during a  historically bad winter  in the early 1960s. The cold of the setting does little to dampen the lively wit of those forced to bear it. \"Every character is there, watching, acting, wilting,\" added the judges. \"It's a real party; there are no extras.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95178","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:16:00-04:00","title":"Meet the Austrian nuns who fled a care home to break into their old convent","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Three elderly Augustinian nuns in Salzburg, Austria — Sister Rita (82), Sister Regina (86), and Sister Bernadette (88) — have defied church authority by returning to their former convent after being moved to a nursing home two years ago.

Nicholson \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 7:16 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SALZBURG, Austria — Morning Mass is underway at the chapel of Schloss Goldenstein, a convent in Elsbethen, an Austrian parish nestled between the church spires of Salzburg and the arresting backdrop of the Alps. Sister Rita is delighted to see so many people in attendance. As Catholic  congregation numbers dwindle  in Austria, Sister Rita says you'd expect the church to be equally thrilled by such tightly packed pews, but 82-year-old Rita and fellow Sisters Regina, 86, and Bernadette, 88, are in their superior's bad books. \"People are calling us the rebellious sisters!\" Rita says with a giggle and a glint in her eye. The three Augustinian sisters — who use only their religious names — recently ran away from a nursing home and, with the help of a local locksmith, broke back into the convent that used to be their home. Rita jokes that they are octogenarian squatters. Giggles aside, Rita says they were taken to a nursing home  against their will  two years ago when church authorities shuttered the cloisters as nun numbers diminished. \"When the opportunity arose to return to our beloved convent, we didn't wait for his permission\" The parishioners who hired a U-Haul and helped the sisters stage their getaway are now joined by a whole host of locals eager to help the sisters grow old on their own terms. Sister Rita says they simply had to act. \"I wanted to speak to the prelate to tell him how unhappy we were but we couldn't reach him,\" she explains. \"When the opportunity arose to return to our beloved convent, we didn't wait for his permission. But I don't want him to be angry with us.\" But their superior,  Provost Markus Grasl , is not pleased with the sisters' dissent. And when their getaway made headlines last month, he brought in a PR firm specializing in damage control. So Harald Schiffl now speaks on the clergyman's behalf. \"It goes without saying that the sisters were consulted before being moved into the nursing home,\" Schiffl says. \"And it's understandable that after decades of living and working in one place, such a move is not easy.\" Schiffl explains that Sisters Rita, Bernadette and Regina were the last three remaining nuns in the cloister and that staying there was unwise as they aged. He stresses that the provost's decision to move them was made with their best interests in mind. But the sisters have no intention of hanging up their wimples; they entered the cloister on the understanding they would serve there — and at the adjoining convent school — for the rest of their lives. And their reach now goes far beyond the parish; the nuns now have their  own Instagram account , currently with 70,000 followers. Schiffl, the provost's spokesperson, says the nuns' social media presence is unbecoming of their order and that their superiors take a  dim view  of it. \"Without all the media interest, a viable and sustainable solution would have been found long ago, causing far less damage to the church,\" Schiffl asserts. But Christina Wirtenberger, one of the sisters' former students who initiated \"operation get thee to a nunnery,\" says they were advised to make it public. \"We invited the press along to prevent the provost from turfing the sisters out of the convent,\" Wirtenberger says. \"I was told that he would not be so bold in front of the press.\" Sixty-five-year-old Wirtenberger has known the sisters since she was 10 years old. She says that while they are as headstrong and sharp as ever, they're also vulnerable on account of their age. When other volunteers suggested launching the Instagram account, Wirtenberger said only on the proviso the sisters gave their express permission. Eighty-eight-year-old Sister Bernadette, who has been a nun here since 1955, takes social media stardom in her stride. \"I think it's wonderful that Instagram brings people to us to praise God. Sure, they're curious to see us after all the press coverage, but what they see is our worship,\" Bernadette enthuses. \"So heaven uses tech to spread the word? God arranged this, not us!\" But Bernadette is still reeling about what happened. As she climbs four flights of stairs, she says the stair lift was removed from the cloister not long after her own removal. \"I'd been in hospital for two weeks and, when I was discharged, I thought I was returning home to the convent,\" Sister Bernadette explains. \"But the ambulance took me to a nursing home in my nightgown. I was shocked. The provost came but didn't speak to me. I called after him, saying I would only be obedient for a week.\" They're accused of breaking their vows Through his spokesperson, Provost Grasl has accused the sisters of  breaking their vows . But Wolfgang Rothe — a priest and scholar of canon law — says this charge is often pitted at critics within the church. \"It's rather telling that the church reaches for the cudgel of obedience to quash dissent,\" Rothe says. \"But the sisters' vow of obedience refers to their obligation to listen to each other. It's not about kowtowing to the powers above.\" Rothe, who sits on a  German Bishops' Conference  advisory board that advocates for the victims of sexual violence and abuse in the Catholic Church, says involving the media is the only way to safeguard the vulnerable. \"The church authorities fear the media like the devil fears holy water because they'd rather keep hidden what is going on behind closed doors,\" Rothe says. Behind closed cloister doors after Mass, Sister Bernadette brews an espresso and reflects on what it means to be home with Sisters Regina and Rita. \"There is such harmony between the three of us. Of course, we all have our own personality! It wouldn't be fair on God if we were all the same,\" she says. \"That is the beauty of our order; every sister can be herself.\" Nuns on the Run  meets  The Sound of Music It all sounds rather familiar in Salzburg, where dissenting nuns with personality are a specialty. In the center of town, a merry group of prosecco-sipping women have launched into some al fresco karaoke in praise of another rebellious nun — Maria von Trapp, immortalized as the nun who \" waltzes on her way to Mass \" by Julie Andrews in the 1965 film  The Sound of Music.  By complete chance, they bump into the one-time nun Maria's real-life granddaughter, Elisabeth von Trapp. Von Trapp has known Sister Bernadette for years, which she says is hardly a surprise considering her family's track record with nuns. Von Trapp, who was born in the United States where her family settled after fleeing the Nazis, returns to Salzburg regularly. One summer, about a decade ago, she chanced upon the convent at Schloss Goldenstein. She says she didn't think twice about ringing the bell. \"When Sister Bernadette answered and opened the door to me, I mentioned that my name was Elisabeth von Trapp. She put two and two together very quickly,\" says von Trapp. \"But here's the thing: All of it is connected.\" Von Trapp, who has continued the family singing tradition, ended up giving a concert in the convent chapel. \"The sisters rallied around and I remember them sitting up in the choir loft,\" von Trapp recalls. \"I ended up with 'Climb Every Mountain,' which I figured was, you know, it's the nuns song in  The Sound of Music . And there they were leaning down, so happy to hear that song!\" And while this sounds as far-fetched as a Hollywood producer's pitch —  Nuns on the Run  meets  The Sound of Music  — von Trapp says this is no  Sister Act  but something far more profound, pointing out the Augustinian emphasis on community. \"I believe Sister Bernadette has a message,\" von Trapp says. \"It has a lot to do with how she has taken care of the community and who is now surrounding her.\" Among them is Karin Seidl, another former convent student. She says the sisters have devoted their lives to the community and now it's time to give back. \"This is their home! And although we've organized for 24-hour care starting next week, I live just three minutes away so I'm also on hand,\" Seidl says. The church is surely about  practicing  'love thy neighbor,' not just preaching it.\" She says the sisters are as devout as they are defiant and that they deserve agency and dignity in old age. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   In Austria, three nuns, all in their 80s, recently ran away from a nursing home. They broke into their former convent in defiance of church orders, determined to grow old on their own terms. These sisters are now taking Instagram by storm, and they're being supported by a growing community. In the first of two stories, Esme Nicholson reports from Salzburg. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELLS RINGING) ESME NICHOLSON, BYLINE: Morning Mass is underway at the chapel of Schloss Goldenstein, a convent nestled between the church spires of Salzburg and the arresting backdrop of the Alps. Eighty-two-year-old Sister Rita is delighted to see so many people in attendance. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING) NICHOLSON: As Catholic congregation numbers dwindle in Austria, Rita says you'd expect the church to be equally thrilled by such a full chapel. But Rita and fellow sisters Regina and Bernadette are in the local provost's bad books. RITA: (Speaking German). NICHOLSON: She says, \"people are calling us rebellious sisters.\" RITA: (Laughter). NICHOLSON: The three Augustinian nuns are effectively squatting in the convent that used to be their home. Rita says they were taken to a nursing home against their will two years ago when church authorities shuttered the cloisters. But the sisters have no intention of hanging up their habits. They entered the convent on the understanding that they would serve there and at the adjoining school for the rest of their lives. So in September, a group of parishioners rented a U-Haul and, with the help of a local locksmith to get inside, moved the sisters back into the convent and switched the water and electricity back on. Sister Rita says they simply had to act. RITA: (Through interpreter) I wanted to speak to the provost to tell him how unhappy we were. But we couldn't reach him. When the opportunity arose to return to our beloved convent, we didn't wait for his permission. NICHOLSON: When they broke back in, Rita, Bernadette and Regina say their rooms looked as if they'd been ransacked and that their personal belongings, including letters and photographs, were all gone. But their superior, Provost Markus Grasl, is not pleased with the sisters' dissent. And when their getaway made headlines, he brought in a PR firm specializing in damage control. So Harald Schiffl now speaks on the clergyman's behalf. HARALD SCHIFFL: (Through interpreter) It goes without saying that the sisters were consulted before being moved into the nursing home, and it's understandable that after decades of living and working in one place, such a move is not easy. NICHOLSON: Schiffl adds that the provost was acting out of concern for the sisters and that the nearly empty convent was not suitable for their care needs in old age. But the sisters insist that they did not agree to leave. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAPEL DOOR CLOSING) NICHOLSON: In the chapel, the pews creak as a latecomer joins a throng of worshippers eager to see the defiant nuns who've gone viral with their own Instagram account. Christina Wirtenberger, one of the sisters' former students who helped plot their return, says they went public on purpose. CHRISTINA WIRTENBERGER: (Through interpreter) We invited the press along to prevent the provost from turfing the sisters out of the convent. I was told that he would not be so bold on camera. NICHOLSON: Sixty-five-year-old Wirtenberger has known the sisters since she was 10. She says that while headstrong and as sharp as ever, they're also vulnerable. When other volunteers suggested launching an Instagram account, she said only on the condition the sisters gave their express permission. Eighty-eight-year-old Sister Bernadette, who has been a nun here since 1955, takes social media stardom in her stride. BERNADETTE: (Through interpreter) I think it's wonderful that Instagram brings people to us to praise God. Sure, they're curious to see us after all the press coverage, but what they see is our worship. NICHOLSON: But Bernadette is still reeling about what happened. As she climbs four flights of stairs, she says the chair lift was removed from the cloister not long after her own removal. BERNADETTE: (Through interpreter) I'd been in hospital for two weeks, and when I was discharged, I thought I was returning home to the convent. But the ambulance took me to a nursing home in my nightgown. I was shocked. NICHOLSON: And that's when Sister Bernadette decided to rebel. For NPR News, I'm Esme Nicholson in Salzburg. CHANG: Now, if the story of disobedient Salzburg nuns ring a bell, tune in again tomorrow for Part 2 of this story. We'll hear from a friend of Sister Bernadette, the granddaughter of Maria von Trapp - yes, that Maria von Trapp - the onetime nun immortalized in Technicolor by Julie Andrews in the film, \"The Sound Of Music.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE SOUND OF MUSIC\") JULIE ANDREWS: (As Maria von Trapp, singing) The hills are alive with the sound of music with songs they have sung for 1,000 years. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96043","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"A Planet Money Guide To Five Fascinating Economic Studies","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article from Planet Money highlights five recent economic studies that offer compelling insights into real-world issues: the causal link between smartphone app use and declining academic performance (brain rot), the significant financial damage caused by Elon Musk’s political activism to Tesla sales, the unintended consumer cost of U.S. wine tariffs during Trump’s presidency, the structural underrepresentation of women in politics due to gendered party gatekeeping in Germany, and the severe long-term economic consequences of war, including GDP loss and inflation.

Sometimes this research informs our podcasts. Sometimes they inspire newsletters or radio segments. But often these insightful gems are just left on our proverbial shelves gathering dust. And that inspired a recurring newsletter where we take them off the shelves and provide them to you. Welcome to the latest installment of the  Planet Money  Econ Paper Roundup! Today in the  Planet Money  newsletter, five recent papers that lit lightbulbs in our brains, and are maybe worth taking a look at. Brain Rot Is Real?! People have been talking about \"brain rot\" for a while. The basic idea is that consuming junk content — like watching TikTok videos or doomscrolling social media feeds — makes you dumber. Last year, Oxford University Press  actually named  \"brain rot\" the \"Oxford Word of the Year.\" They offer a more formal definition: \"the supposed deterioration of a person's mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration.\" Notice Oxford's definition includes the qualifier  supposed  before deterioration. Until now brain rot has been more of a casual observation than something backed by hard evidence. But a new,  peer-reviewed study  in  The Quarterly Journal of Economics  (a top econ journal) suggests brain rot is very real. The economists Panle Jia Barwick, Siyu Chen, Chao Fu and Teng Li find that students who frequently use smartphone apps see much worse outcomes. This isn't just because frequent app users might be different types of people to infrequent app users. The authors build the case that these bad outcomes are actually  caused  by the apps: they exploit the fact that roommates are randomly assigned, and roommates influence how much students use apps. The economists find that when student uses apps more, they spend less time studying, get less sleep, and are more often late to class. And, the economists find, frequent use of apps leads students to have significantly lower GPAs and even, eventually, lower wages. Ouch. Turn off your phones, people! Musk's Partisan Activism Seriously Damaged Tesla Sales Progressives typically care more about climate change and policies aimed at protecting the environment. This long helped make them an important consumer base for Tesla's electric cars. But then something happened: Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, started using his megaphone to support right-wing policies and candidates, and he alienated many of them big time. It's pretty obvious that Musk's vocal partisanship hurt Tesla sales. But by how much? A  new working paper  by economists Kenneth T. Gillingham, Matthew Kotchen, James A. Levinsohn and Barry J. Nalebuff crunches the numbers. They find that, \"Without the Musk partisan effect, Tesla sales between October 2022 and April 2025 would have been 67-83% higher, equivalent to 1-1.26 million more vehicles.\" Holy moly. Even more, the economists find, \"Musk's partisan activities also increased the sales of other automakers' electric and hybrid vehicles 17-22% because of substitution, and undermined California's progress in meeting its zero-emissions vehicle target.\" Numbers like these may make future CEOs think twice about being very vocal in partisan politics (in any direction) and alienating crucial customers. The Effect Of European Wine Tariffs During President Trump's first term, he imposed tariffs on a variety of goods, including, in 2019, European wine. A  recent working paper  from economists Aaron B. Flaaen, Ali Hortaçsu, Felix Tintelnot, Nicolás Urdaneta and Daniel Xu looks at the effect of these tariffs, including on U.S. consumers. Their answer: they weren't good for them. Tariffs caused wine sellers and distributors to raise their prices, so much so that ultimately consumers \"paid more than the government received in tariff revenue.\" One finding that's particularly noteworthy, considering we're still waiting to see the ultimate effect of Trump's wave of tariffs during his second term: the economists find it took roughly an entire year for the effects of wine tariffs to ping-pong their way through the wine distribution system and ultimately raise the retail prices paid by consumers. A Reason Why Female Politicians May Underperform In Elections There's a pretty well-known theory in economics known as the \"glass cliff.\" The basic idea is that companies often pick female CEOs when their businesses are struggling, which sets them up for failure. Well, there may be something similar in the political realm. A  new working paper  from economists Thomas Fujiwara, Hanno Hilbig and Pia Raffler tests a hypothesis that political parties systematically pick female candidates to compete in districts where their parties are less popular. They test this theory in Germany, with candidates for the German legislature (the Bundestag) across 11 elections. Germany is an interesting place to look at because, in recent years, it's been known for strong female leadership. Angela Merkel served as Germany's chancellor for over 15 years. And it's ranked relatively high in global rankings for gender equality. Still there, the economists write, \"women constitute only 35% of members of parliament.\" What helps explain this? The economists find that \"female underperformance\" in German elections is \"explained almost entirely by women running in districts where their party is less popular.\" They argue that \"gendered party gatekeeping\" is \"an important driver of female underrepresentation\" in the German legislature. And they suggest this is likely true in other nations. An Estimate Of How Bad War Is For An Economy In  a new working paper , the economists Efraim Benmelech and Joao Monteiro look at the economic consequences of war, using a pretty cool dataset that covers \"115 conflicts and 145 countries over the past 75 years.\" They find that wars, on average, reduce national GDP by 13% and those countries fail to recover even after a decade. They find these economic downturns are worse in civil wars. They also find that wars explode deficits and significantly stoke inflation. … So those are our five papers for this edition of the Planet Money Econ Paper Roundup. Not the cheeriest edition we must admit, but one that we hope can help you understand the world better. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5576353","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Dalai Lama Created a Tibetan Capital in Exile in India.

It's shrinking \n         By Diaa Hadid, Omkar Khandekar \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         DHARAMSHALA, India — Boys and girls harmonize together as their music teacher Tenzin Nordel leads them through a Tibetan song in a classroom overlooking an alpine forest. Theater kids practice Tibetan operas in the school hall. Even as they shoot hoops, teenage boys wear traditional shirts that button to one side, under the shoulder. For decades, this is how the  Tibetan Children's Village  imparted Tibetan students with their language, culture and faith in their de facto capital in exile in the northern Indian city  of Dharamshala. Except now, the number of children attending the school is shrinking, echoing the fate of the exile community itself. \"It's like taking water out of a bucket,\" says Bhuchung Sonam, a Tibetan poet and publisher, describing the city. \"You take one jug or two jugs, that much, the bucket becomes that much empty, right?\" The Dalai Lama and his sisters set up Tibetan Children's Village in Dharamshala in 1960, after they fled Chinese-ruled Tibet following a  failed uprising . It  expanded as thousands of people followed their spiritual leader into exile. They enrolled their kids in the school so they'd be raised as Tibetans. The émigrés included parents who only found work in remote, hostile areas like isolated Himalayan villages, carving roads out of steep mountain slopes.  \"It was difficult to keep their small kids with them. So they were sent to Dharamshala,\" says Penpa Tsering, leader of the Central Tibetan Administration, a  government-in-exile  in Dharamshala. Tibetan parents, fathers mostly, also snuck into India to leave their children at the school. They include the 52-year-old poet Sonam, who was about 10 when his father left him in Dharamshala. He estimates that from 1980 to 2008, \"something like 23,000 children came out of Tibet,\" where he says they formed a fifth of all exiles. Educator Tindup Galpo was among them. \"When I was just 7 or 8 years old, in 1984, I crossed the Himalayas,\" Galpo says. All he remembers of the journey is that he and his father \"walked, and then he took me on his shoulder,\" he says. \"From that day till now, almost 40 years, I never met my father.\" Galpo, who guesses he is about 40 years old, was raised by his teachers, who also supervised the boarding houses. He says he didn't feel abandoned or lonely because there were \"thousands\" of other kids just like him. They were like \"brothers and sisters,\" he says. \"This is my home, really, this is my home.\" After Galpo graduated from college, he began working as a teacher at the Children's Village. \"After class, I'm a father of 32 children,\" he says, grinning. He and his wife, who was also raised in the village, take care of the children once their school day is over, helping with their reading and putting them to bed. The school has the capacity to serve 8,642 children across its seven Indian branches, but only 4,682 children are enrolled, according to senior administrator Kalsang Phuntsok.  For years, the village has been consolidating and shuttering classrooms. \"Everything is changing,\" Galpo says. The Tibetan Children's Village \"is shrinking.\" Even in Dharamshala, the largest branch of the Tibetan Children's Village is winding down. Tenzin Choekyi, the branch's principal, says there aren't many younger children entering the system. Compare the first grade class, with only 12 students, to grade 3, with 61 students, she says. That's partly because Tibetans are having fewer children. \"Unlike our older generations,\" Choekyi says with a laugh, referring to her parents who had five children, \"I have only two.\" Tsering of the Central Tibetan Administration tells NPR that the exiled population appeared to peak around 2010, with just over 100,000 Tibetan exiles  living throughout  India. Now, he estimates, there are around 70,000 in India, with another 60,000 Tibetans living across Europe, North America and Australia. Only a trickle of Tibetans have been able to reach India since China hardened its borders in 2008, following an uprising in Chinese-ruled Tibet ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics. \"That security apparatus never really got rolled back up once the games were over,\" says Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. And \"the border has been much more heavily patrolled.\" Before 2008, she says, \"there were at least a couple of hundred people coming out over the border every year, and I think we're down into the single digits now.\" One Tibetan who managed to reach Dharamshala is 27-year-old Namkyi, who only has one name.  When she was just a teenager, Namkyi says she was sent to a prison work camp in Tibet for three years as punishment for brandishing a picture of the Dalai Lama. She had been plotting her escape from China ever since. It took her nine years to find the right people to smuggle her out, she says, and she finally made it in the spring of 2023. But living in Dharamshala sometimes saddens her, she says. \"Everyone is going abroad, there are no children here.\" They're migrating to the West. \"These social and demographic changes are a huge challenge for us,\" says Tsering, explaining that Dharamshala was built as a \"compact community, where all Tibetans live together.\" That has allowed Tibetans \"to preserve our identity through our schools, monastic institutions, cultural institutions.\" In the Tibetan Children's Village, some of the children are looking for the exits. Like 15-year-old Gawa, who met NPR reporters at the school library on a recent day, as the sound of children practicing an opera filtered through. Gawa said he spent most days between Buddhist worship, basketball and school. He wanted to be a poet — except he figured that studying medicine would provide him with a more stable future. So he's trying to get a scholarship to a university in the United Kingdom. \"I want to pursue my future abroad, where there are more opportunities, more facilities, more everything,\" Gawa said. Gawa said he saw India as a place he'd return to for holidays — something he says his traditional Tibetan parents supported: His mother is a teacher at the school and his father works in a Buddhist monastery. The slow unraveling of the Tibetan capital in exile comes at a precarious time. The Dalai Lama  turned 90  in July. He says his successor — or reincarnate — will be born outside of China, but the Chinese government  insists only it  has the authority to select the next Dalai Lama. \"We are definitely concerned,\" says  Lobsang Sangay , the former head of the Tibetan government in exile. He says historically, the period between the passing of the old Dalai Lama and the enthronement of the new is \"our most volatile, sensitive, delicate period.\" Sangay  says Tibetans were heartened when President Trump, during his first administration, signed a law that  sanctions  Chinese officials who interfere in Tibetan religious matters. \"The Secretary of State Rubio was a co-sponsor of the bill,\" he says of Marco Rubio, who was a Florida senator at the time. \"Now he's in a position to implement it.\" But in Trump's second administration, Rubio halted some $12 million of aid earmarked for Tibetan exiles as a part of broader cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the Central Tibetan Administration. Asked about the funds, the State Department told NPR it has resumed distribution of just over half the aid and continues to call on China to cease its interference in the Dalai Lama's succession. Amid concerns about the future of the Tibetan movement for autonomy, Sangay says Tibetans have clung to a simple truth: \"Our job is simple: We have to survive. As long as we survive, we will have our opportunities.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   When the Dalai Lama fled Chinese-controlled Tibet, he eventually came to the Indian town of Dharamshala. For decades, Tibetan refugees followed him there. NPR's Diaa Hadid reports that that is changing. TENZIN NORDEL: (Vocalizing). DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Music teacher Tenzin Nordel leads kids through a Tibetan song in a classroom overlooking an alpine forest. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (Singing in non-English language). HADID: This is how the Tibetan Children's Village teaches students their language, culture and faith in a place vastly different from their homeland. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HADID: Here, theater kids practice Tibetan operas. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (Singing in non-English language). HADID: They wear Tibetan clothes, even while they shoot hoops. (CHEERING) HADID: The Dalai Lama set up the Tibetan Children's Village with his sisters after he fled to Dharamshala amid a failed uprising against China's rule more than 60 years ago. The school expanded as thousands of Tibetans followed the Dalai Lama. Then there were people like Tindup Galpo. TINDUP GALPO: My father and me crossed the Himalayas. HADID: Galpo guesses he was 7 when his father left him at the school and then returned to Chinese-ruled Tibet. He hasn't seen his father since. He was raised by his teachers, who also supervise the school's boarding houses. Now Galpo is a schoolteacher and... GALPO: After class, I'm a father of 32 children. HADID: He works at the boarding school that raised him, helping kids with their homework, reading, bedtimes, at least for now. GALPO: Everything is - I don't know (laughter). HADID: Changing. GALPO: Changing. HADID: The Tibetan Children's Village is shrinking. The school has capacity for about 9,000 kids across India. Only about half that number attend. That's partly because Tibetans are having fewer kids these days. And China has hardened its borders dramatically in the past two decades, so fewer kids have reached Dharamshala. One person who did make it across is 27-year-old Namkyi. She only goes by one name. NAMKYI: (Speaking Tibetan). HADID: She'd been trying for nine years to find a way to flee ever since she was released from a three-year prison sentence, she says, for brandishing a picture of the Dalai Lama. NAMKYI: (Speaking Tibetan). HADID: But since reaching Dharamshala last year, Namkyi says she's been noticing the change. NAMKYI: (Speaking Tibetan). HADID: Her friend Sonam (ph) translates. He also only goes by one name. SONAM: Those in India, like, many of them are migrating to the West. HADID: Migrating to the West. The Tibetan government-in-exile estimates there were about 100,000 Tibetans in India. That number began falling as migration to the West stepped up in the '90s. Now India hosts about 70,000 Tibetans and about the same number live in Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Sonam, who's translating for Namkyi, describes it like... SONAM: It's like throwing rice in a cotton field. HADID: Like throwing rice in a cotton field, where it's scattered, where it doesn't belong, where it won't flourish because, he says, the institutions that keep Tibetan identity alive are here in Dharamshala. At the Children's Village, some of the brightest kids are looking for the exits, like Gawa. He's 15 and a minor, so we aren't using his full name. We met at the school library. He speaks four languages. GAWA: French, Hindi, English and Tibetan. HADID: And he loves Lana Del Rey. GAWA: The song that goes like, dear Lord, when I get to heaven, please let me bring my man. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL\") LANA DEL RAY: (Singing) Dear Lord, when I get to heaven, please let me bring my man. HADID: Gawa loves poetry but figures he's got a better future as a doctor. He's vying for a scholarship to study in the U.K. GAWA: There's more opportunities. There's everything. HADID: This westward drift comes at a precarious time. The Dalai Lama turned 90 in July. Beijing insists it will select the next Dalai Lama, against the wishes of the Dalai Lama and Tibetans. LOBSANG SANGAY: That's our most volatile period. HADID: Lobsang Sangay is the former head of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He says Tibetans were heartened when President Trump, during his first administration, signed into law an act that sanctions Chinese officials who interfere in Tibetan religious matters. But in Trump's second administration, the secretary of State, Marco Rubio, halted some $12 million of aid earmarked to Tibetan exiles in the spring. He then restored just over half of it. Amid these worries that many Tibetans express about this moment, Sangay says Tibetans cling to a simple truth. SANGAY: Our job is simple. That is, we have to survive. HADID: As long as we survive, he says, Tibetans will have the opportunity to meet this changing moment. Diaa Hadid, NPR News, Dharamshala.

George W. Bush’s vice president died Monday from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said Tuesday in a statement. In Cheney’s hands, the vice presidency became a nexus of influence and manipulation — no longer the timid office whose occupants had tended their boss’s ambitions, gone to endless banquets and often waited in the wings for their own shot at the prize.

Bush before returning to public life under his son. Cheney was, in effect, the chief operating officer of the younger Bush’s presidency. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. Cheney consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Bush said Tuesday.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Cheney assailed Trump Years after leaving office, Cheney became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after his daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump’s desperate attempts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter . “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward.” In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate , Kamala Harris, for president against Trump. Trump said nothing about Cheney publicly in the hours after his death was disclosed. The White House lowered flags to half-staff in remembrance of him but without the usual announcement or proclamation praising the deceased. For all his conservatism, Cheney was supportive of his daughter Mary Cheney after she came out as gay, years before gay marriage was broadly supported, then legalized. “Freedom means freedom for everyone,” he said. A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 that he awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts. Cheney made his vice presidency a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq , terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other conservative cornerstones. Fixed with a seemingly permanent half-smile -- detractors called it a smirk -- Cheney joked about his outsize reputation as a stealthy manipulator. Among those who worked with him and sometimes crossed him, Bush White House adviser Dan Bartlett told a Miller Center oral history series that you always knew where you stood with Cheney. “In Washington and politics you get a lot of people who will stab you in the back,” he said. “Dick Cheney was perfectly comfortable with stabbing you in the chest.” He liked that about him.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The Iraq War A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without losing the conviction he was essentially right. He alleged links between the 9/11 attacks and prewar Iraq that didn’t exist. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren’t. He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war’s end. The U.S. intervention unseated the longtime autocratic leader, Saddam Hussein, but opened up a security vacuum that led to years of brutal civil war, the rise of extremist groups including the Islamic State and the expansion of Iranian influence. On a busy street in Baghdad, Ahmad Jabar called former Cheney a “bloodthirsty person.” “They destroyed us,” he said of the Bush administration, “and Dick Cheney specifically destroyed us. How are we supposed to remember him?” For admirers, Cheney kept the faith in a shaky time, resolute even as the nation turned against the war and the leaders waging it. But well into Bush’s second term, Cheney’s clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities. Courts ruled against efforts he championed to broaden presidential authority and accord special harsh treatment to terrorism suspects.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Cheney’s relationship with Bush From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself. That bargain largely held up. As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.” His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. He came to be seen as a thin-skinned figure orchestrating a bungled response to criticism of the Iraq War. And when he shot a hunting companion in the torso, neck and face with an errant shotgun blast in 2006, he and his coterie were slow to disclose that episode. It was “one of the worst days of my life,” Cheney said. The victim, his friend Harry Whittington , recovered and quickly forgave him. Comedians were relentless about it for months. When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Cheney led the team to find a vice presidential candidate. Bush decided the best choice was the man picked to help with the choosing. Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. Recounts and court challenges left the nation in limbo for weeks. Cheney took charge of the presidential transition before victory was clear and helped give the Republican administration a smooth launch despite the lost time. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush’s constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there. On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president’s programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. 2 Republican House leader. Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn’t seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush’s presidency as he clearly came into his own. On Sept. 11, 2001, with Bush out of town, the president gave Cheney approval to authorize the military to shoot down any hijacked planes still in the sky. By then, two airliners had hit the World Trade Center and a third was bearing down on the capital from nearby Dulles airport in Virginia. A Secret Service agent burst into the West Wing room, grabbed Cheney by the belt and shoulder and led him to a bunker underneath the White House. “He didn’t say, ‘Shall we go?’” Cheney told NBC News years later. “He wasn’t polite about it.” Cheney talked to Bush again from the bunker and told him, “Washington was under attack, as well as New York.” After Bush’s return to the White House that night, Cheney was taken to a secret location to keep the president and vice president separated and try to ensure that at least one of them would survive any further attack. Cheney said his first reaction to hearing of the crash of the fourth hijacked plane, in Pennsylvania, was that the U.S. might have shot it down per his order. It came down after passengers fought the hijackers. The American flag is seen at half-staff, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, at the White House in Washington.

He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill., serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford’s White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34. Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, Wyoming, where he had been raised, and ran for the state’s lone congressional seat. In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms. In 1989, Cheney became defense secretary under the first President Bush and led the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, which drove Iraq’s troops from Kuwait. Between the two Bush administrations, Cheney led Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a large engineering and construction company for the oil industry. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but failed out. He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964. He is survived by his wife and daughters. ___ Associated Press writers Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Ali Abdul-Hassan in Baghdad, and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mamdani-cuomo-sliwa-nyc-mayor-af8b9790e7cb4e023d0984a0207cbcca","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:17:38+00:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City Mayor in Historic Victory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker of South Asian heritage and born in Uganda, has been elected mayor of New York City in a historic victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

on Tuesday, capping a stunning ascent for the 34-year-old state lawmaker, who was set to become the city’s most liberal mayor in generations. In a victory for the Democratic party’s progressive wing , Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani must now navigate the unending demands of America’s biggest city and deliver on ambitious — skeptics say unrealistic — campaign promises. With the victory, the democratic socialist will etch his place in history as the city’s first Muslim mayor , the first of South Asian heritage and the first born in Africa. He will also become the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century when he takes office on Jan. 1. Zohran Mamdani votes on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York.

With roughly 90% of the votes counted, Mamdani held an approximately 9 percentage point lead over Cuomo. Mamdani’s unlikely rise gives credence to Democrats who have urged the party to embrace more progressive, left-wing candidates instead of rallying behind centrists in hopes of winning back swing voters who have abandoned the party. He has already faced scrutiny from national Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who have eagerly cast him as a threat and the face of what they say is a more radical Democratic Party. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding to the city — and even take it over — if Mamdani won. Mamdani “is now the face of the Democratic Party,” New York GOP Chair Ed Cox said in a statement. At his victory party in Brooklyn, Mamdani supporters cheered and embraced, some tearfully, after The Associated Press called the race. Campaign posters flew through the air, as one person hoisted the official flag of New York City and Bad Bunny played from the speakers. Mamdani’s X account posted a video of a subway train pulling up to City Hall station, with an announcement that said, “The next and last stop is City Hall.” Supporters for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani react as they watch returns during an election night watch party, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York.

In his concession speech, a defiant Cuomo called his campaign “a caution flag that we are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road” and noted that “almost half of New Yorkers did not vote to support a government agenda that makes promises that we know cannot be met.” Still, he corrected his supporters when they began to boo at the mention of Mamdani’s name. “No, that is not right,” he said, offering to help the incoming mayor in any way. “Tonight was their night.” Mamdani’s grassroots campaign centered on affordability, and his charisma spoiled Cuomo’s attempted political comeback. The former governor, who resigned four years ago following allegations of sexual harassment that he continues to deny, was dogged by his past throughout the race and was criticized for running a negative campaign. Mamdani will also have to deal with Trump, who not only threatened retribution against the city , but also suggested he might try to arrest and deport Mamdani if he won. Mamdani was born in Uganda , where he spent his early childhood, but was raised in New York City and became a U.S. citizen in 2018.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Mamdani’s most prominent backers, said New Yorkers would fight back. “We’re going to stand up to bullies and thugs in the White House,” she told reporters. New mayor will pursue an ambitious agenda Mamdani, who was criticized throughout the campaign for his thin resume, will now have to begin staffing his incoming administration before taking office next year and game out how he plans to accomplish the ambitious but polarizing agenda that drove him to victory. Among the campaign’s promises are free child care, free city bus service, city-run grocery stores and a new Department of Community Safety that would send mental health care workers to handle certain emergency calls rather than police officers. It is unclear how Mamdani will pay for such initiatives, given Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s steadfast opposition to his calls to raise taxes on wealthy people. His decisions around the leadership of the New York Police Department will also be closely watched. Mamdani was a fierce critic of the department in 2020, calling for “this rogue agency” to be defunded and slamming it as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” He has since apologized for those comments and has said he will ask the current NYPD commissioner to stay on the job. Mamdani’s campaign was driven by his optimistic view of the city and his promises to improve the quality of life for its middle and lower classes. But Cuomo, Sliwa and other critics assailed him over his vehement criticism of Israel ’s military actions in Gaza. Mamdani, a longtime advocate of Palestinian rights, has accused Israel of committing genocide and said he would honor an arrest warrant the International Criminal Court issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mamdani won over the city while Cuomo faltered Mamdani began his campaign as a relatively obscure state lawmaker, little known even within New York City. Going into the Democratic primary, Cuomo was the presumed favorite, with near-universal name recognition and deep political connections. Cuomo’s chances were buoyed further when incumbent Mayor Eric Adams bowed out of the primary while dealing with the fallout of his now-dismissed federal corruption case . But as the race progressed, Mamdani’s natural charm, catchy social media videos and populist economic platform energized voters in the notoriously expensive city. He also began drawing outside attention as his name ID grew.

The former governor relaunched his campaign as an independent candidate for the general election, vowing to hit the streets with a more energetic approach. However, much of his campaign continued to focus on attacking opponents. In the race’s final stretch, he claimed Mamdani’s election would make Jews feel unsafe. Meanwhile, supporters packed Mamdani’s rallies , and he held whimsical events, including a scavenger hunt and a community soccer tournament. Cuomo also juxtaposed his deep experience in government with Mamdani’s less than five years in the state Legislature. But the former governor also faced his own political baggage, as his opponents dredged up the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation, as well as his decisions during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sliwa, the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, also had his moments — mostly in the form of funny quips on the debate stage — but had difficulty gaining traction as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. He conceded the race about a half hour after the polls closed, wishing Mamdani “good luck because if he does well, we do well.” But he also issued a warning: “If you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people’s public safety, we will become the mayor-elect and his supporters’ worst enemies.” ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Philip Marcelo and Jake Offenhartz contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/virginia-new-jersey-trump-election-democrat-republican-fad109893cfd4be5b49a5bb1b0138d8d","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:01:33+00:00","title":"Democrats Win Key Off-Year Elections Amid Economic Concerns and Voter Dissatisfaction with Trump’s Policies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the first major election since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, Democrats achieved significant victories in Virginia and New Jersey, winning governorships and sweeping state Supreme Court races.

returned to the White House. And while a debate about the future of the Democratic Party may have only just begun, there are signs that the economy — specifically, Trump’s inability to deliver the economic turnaround he promised last fall — may be a real problem for Trump’s GOP heading into next year’s higher-stakes midterm elections. Democrats on Tuesday won governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey , the only states electing new chief executives this year. They also swept a trio of state Supreme Court contests in swing-state Pennsylvania and ballots measures from Colorado to Maine. Trump was largely absent from the campaign trail, but GOP candidates closely aligned themselves with the president, betting that his big win last year could provide a path to victory this time. They were wrong. Democrats are hoping the off-year romp offers a new winning playbook, but some caution may be warranted. Tuesday’s elections were limited to a handful of states, most of which lean blue, and the party that holds the White House typically struggles in off-year elections. Related Stories Voters prioritize the economy above immigration and crime in Election 2025, AP Voter Poll finds 4 MIN READ Democrat Mikie Sherrill elected governor of New Jersey, defeating opponent who aligned with Trump 5 MIN READ Republicans seek to tap into Trump energy on eve of Election Day in New Jersey, Virginia 3 MIN READ Meanwhile, Republicans in Washington may be more excited than Democrats that a self-described democratic socialist will become New York City’s next mayor. Here’s some top takeaways: A new Democratic playbook emerges Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become Virginia’s next governor — and its first female chief executive — while Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the New Jersey governor’s office by running campaigns focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care. Early results showed Democrats outperforming their margins from four years ago in fast-growing suburbs, rural areas and even places with high concentrations of military voters. The Democrats won by actively distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party’s far-left policies and emphasized what Spanberger described in her victory speech as “pragmatism over partisanship.” A growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party’s revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Above all, the Democrats in both states focused on rising costs such as groceries, energy and health care, which Trump has struggled to control. In addition to tacking to the middle on economic issues, Spanberger and Sherrill downplayed their support for progressive priorities, including LGBTQ rights and resistance against Trump’s attack on American institutions. Spanberger rarely even mentioned Trump’s name on the campaign trail. Both also have resumes that appealed to the middle. Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who spent years abroad working undercover, while Sherrill spent a decade as an active-duty helicopter pilot for the Navy before entering Congress. Both played up their public safety backgrounds as a direct response to the GOP’s attack that Democrats are soft on crime. It’s (still) the economy, stupid Trump and his Republican allies have been especially focused on immigration, crime and conservative cultural issues. But voters who decided Tuesday’s top elections were more concerned about the economy, jobs and costs of living. That’s according to the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 17,000 voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City suggesting that many voters felt they can’t get ahead financially in today’s economy. Ironically, the same economic anxieties helped propel Trump to the White House just one year ago. Now, the economic concerns appear to be undermining his party’s political goals in 2025 — and could be more problematic for the GOP in next year’s midterm elections, which will decide the balance of power for Trump’s final two years in office. That’s even as Trump regularly brags about stock prices booming and boasted about leading a new renaissance of American manufacturing. About half of Virginia voters said the economy was the most important issue facing their state while most New Jersey voters said either taxes or the economy were the top issue in their state. Just over half of New York City voters said cost of living was their top concern. It was unclear whether kitchen table concerns weighing so heavily on voters might help break the impasse that has prompted the government shutdown, which has spanned more than a month. A referendum on Trump This was the first election since Trump’s return to the presidency and voters rejected candidates and causes aligned with his Republican Party from Virginia and Pennsylvania to Maine and New Jersey. It was, in fact, difficult to point to any significant victory for Trump’s party. They also expressed strong feelings about the direction of the country under his leadership. About 6 in 10 voters in Virginia and New Jersey said they are “angry” or “dissatisfied” with the way things are going in the country today, according to the AP Voter Poll. Just one-third said they are “enthusiastic” or “satisfied.” In a sign of the extent of the GOP’s struggles, Republicans lost the Virginia attorney general’s race to Democrat Jay Jones, who was forced to apologize after text messages surfaced weeks before Election Day in which he depicted the murder of political opponents. Fearing a bad night, Trump tried to distance himself from the election results. The president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night . Trump also did a Monday night tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he focused mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general, who also lost. Despite Trump’s distance, his policies — including his “big, beautiful” budget bill and his massive cuts to the federal workforce — played a central role in Virginia, New Jersey and even New York City’s mayoral contest. And the Republicans in each refused to distance themselves from the president or his agenda. The results left the president ducking blame. “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,” according to pollsters, he posted on his social media account. Trump planned to have breakfast Wednesday at the White House with Senate Republicans who have so far opposed his calls to end the shutdown by abandoning the legislative filibuster, the 60-vote minimum needed to pass most major legislation though the Senate. A new star for Democrats (and Republicans) in New York City Moderates won in Virginia and New Jersey. But it was a self-described democratic socialist who cruised to victory in New York City. Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state legislator who backs radical changes to address economic inequality, will serve as the next mayor of the nation’s largest city. His bold agenda and inspirational approach helped generate the largest turnout in a New York City mayoral race in at least three decades. It also spooked some business leaders and voices in the Jewish community, who otherwise support Democrats but oppose some of Mamdani’s past statements about personal wealth accumulation and Israel. Trump, who actually endorsed Mamdani’s independent opponent, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, falsely called Mamdani a communist on the eve of the election. Some Republicans in Washington were quietly rooting for a Mamdani victory. Even before his win was final, Republican campaign committees launched attack ads against more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats in New York and New Jersey linking them to Mamdani and his far-left politics. The ad campaign is expected to extend to Democrats across the country ahead of next year’s midterms. More Democratic wins The Democratic successes extended beyond Virginia, New Jersey and New York. In Pennsylvania, Democrats swept all three elections for state supreme court justices. The wins could have implications for key cases involving redistricting and balloting for midterm elections — and the 2028 presidential race — in the nation’s most populous swing state. Conservative causes struggled on ballot questions in other states as well. Maine voters defeated a measure that would have mandated showing an ID at the polls while approving a “red flag” rule meant to make it easier for family members to petition a court to restrict a potentially dangerous person’s access to guns. Colorado approved raising taxes on people earning more than $300,000 to fund school meal programs and food assistance for low-income state residents. And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, frequently mentioned as a 2028 presidential hopeful, led a triumphant charge to redraw congressional maps to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections. The push is the centerpiece of a Democratic effort to counter new Republican maps in Texas and elsewhere that were drawn to boost the GOP’s chances in next year’s fight to control Congress. For the new maps to count in 2026, however, Californians had to vote on a yes-or-no ballot question known as Proposition 50 . It was easily approved."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/california-redistricting-prop-50-gavin-newsom-839193bfc2a817086acca7365315f26f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:22:05+00:00","title":"California Voters Approve Redistricting Measure to Counter GOP Gerrymandering","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters approved Proposition 50 on November 4, 2025, which suspends independent redistricting and replaces it with new congressional district boundaries drawn by the Democratic-controlled state legislature.

results pages. LOS ANGELES (AP) — California voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump’s agenda. The approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans’ move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump’s urging. Texas’ move and California’s response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats’ best opportunity to make up seats. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party’s slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 213. Tuesday’s results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy. Measure supported by Newsom, Obama California’s Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters’ power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. The measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well. Gov. Gavin Newsom arrives at a campaign event on Proposition 50 in San Francisco, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Gov.

They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump’s moves in Republican-led states. Among the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September , arguing that the proposal would “take the power away from the people.” “I don’t want Newsom to have control,” said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Norco in Southern California, who voted against the measure. “I don’t want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.” A lopsided campaign foreshadowed the vote After an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation’s most expensive media markets. Data compiled by advertising tracker AdImpact last week showed Democrats and other supporters with over $5 million in ad buys booked on broadcast TV, cable and radio. But opponents had virtually no time reserved, though the data didn’t include some popular streaming services like Hulu and YouTube or mail advertising.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped – and their jobs endangered — mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks. Total spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race’s final weeks. The GOP congressmen — Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa — will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race. Issa issued a defiant statement, saying: “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live. I’m not quitting on California.” Calvert said Newsom engineered a “power grab” while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. “I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,” he said in an email. AP poll finds voters motivated by political reasons Proposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California. Roughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was “very important” to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll. About 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found. Trump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail — messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state’s voting process “RIGGED” and warned that it was “under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!” Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that “another baseless claim.” The national House map is in flux Democrats hope to pick up as many as five seats in California if voters approve the new boundaries, offsetting the five that Republicans are looking to pick up through their new Texas maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Congressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place. Five other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska. On the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain. A court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats. Here’s what to know about Election Night 2025: Down the ballot in some states, voters approved Democrat ballot measures, except in deep-red Texas : In Maine, voters rejected changes to voting that would have shortened the early voting period and required photo ID —something Trump called for in a social media post Tuesday night. Voters in the state also approved a red flag law gun control measure . In Colorado, voters opted to raise taxes on higher-earning households to pay for public school student meals . While Maine remains competitive for Republicans, Colorado has shifted left. In Texas, meanwhile, votes approved amendments to the state constitution that require U.S. citizenship to vote there and to affirm that parents are the primary decision-makers for their children. Impact on national politics next year and beyond: The one contest on Tuesday that may do the most to shape national politics going forward is a measure on the ballot in California , where voters will decide whether to approve a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control in the 2026 midterm elections. California’s Proposition 50 is a response to Trump’s gerrymandering push to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. How the AP calls races: The AP takes a careful and thorough analysis of the latest available vote tallies and a variety of other election data , with the goal of answering this question: Is there any circumstance in which the trailing candidate can catch up? If the answer is no, then the leading candidate has won. Read more here about how it is done . Siddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom’s measure. “I don’t like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,” Deb said. “And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.” ___ Cooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.

2025-11-04T18:26:53+00:00\n\nROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents’ aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits . From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city. “I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics. More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana. Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who’ve spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He’s regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village , a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor. Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas. During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning. Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face. “We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.” Immigration agents’ tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center , has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application. Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration’s use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because “you have to get the people out.” “I think (the raids) haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday. Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints. Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws. Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach. “A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.” Bovino said he hasn’t seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents’ accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Approval of updated shots also came several weeks later than usual, and Pfizer said Tuesday that hurt sales as well. Many Americans get vaccinations in the fall, to protect against any disease surges in the coming winter. Experts say interest in COVID-19 shots has been declining, and that trend could pick up this fall due to anti-vaccine sentiment and confusion about whether the shots are necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone, instead leaving the choice up to patients. The government agency said it was adopting recommendations made by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Before this year, U.S. health officials — following the advice of infectious disease experts — recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection as the coronavirus evolves.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “That’s only going to fall off more this season,” the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said recently. The shifting guidance caused some confusion in September, once updated shots began arriving at drugstores, the main place Americans go to get vaccinated. Some locations required prescriptions or started asking customers if they had a condition that made them susceptible to a bad case of COVID-19. The change in government guidance also created questions about whether insurance coverage would continue. A major industry group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, has since clarified that its members will cover the shots. CVS Health announced earlier this month that it will not require prescriptions at its stores and clinics. Pharmacy owner Theresa Tolle says this fall has probably been one of the more confusing seasons for her customers. Tolle runs the independent Bay Street Pharmacy in Sebastian, Florida. She said her COVID-19 vaccine business has been busy because she has an older patient population. Many still want the shots. But she’s also had more customers tell her this year that they don’t want them. “There’s just so many messages out there, they don’t know who to believe,” she said. “I’ve had people tell me they are afraid of it when they’ve had it many times.” Pfizer saw U.S. Comirnaty sales drop to $870 million in the recently completed third quarter from $1.16 billion in the same time frame last year. That came after vaccine sales rose the first two quarters of the year. Pfizer also said Tuesday that sales of its COVID-19 treatment, Paxlovid, dropped more than 50% in the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally due to lower infection rates. Wall Street analysts also expect sales of the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax from Moderna to tumble about 50% in the third quarter, according to the data firm FactSet. Moderna will report its third-quarter results on Thursday."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/election-2025-voting-threats-monitors-ballots-225eba3f30c8697924fc166ed9996736","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:54:09+00:00","title":"Bomb Threats to New Jersey Polling Stations, Voter Roll Error in Pennsylvania, and Trump’s Warning on California Mail Balloting Mark Final Day of Off-Year Voting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the final day of voting in a major off-year election, several disruptions occurred across the U.S., including bomb threats targeting polling stations in New Jersey—particularly in Passaic County—and a significant voter roll error in Pennsylvania’s Chester County that left nearly 75,000 voters without representation.

in Pennsylvania potentially affecting thousands of voters and warnings by President Donald Trump against California’s mail balloting system marked the final day of voting in an off-year election with several nationally prominent races. Voting otherwise appeared to go smoothly Tuesday across the U.S., as voters cast ballots in the first significant election since Trump won the White House for a second time. They were deciding governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia , a mayor’s race in New York, Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania, and voting and gun control measures in Maine. A redistricting initiative in California that was a response to Trump’s push to redraw congressional lines in GOP-controlled states ahead of next year’s midterm elections has been of particular interest to the Republican president. His Department of Justice sent election monitors to five counties in California, a state Trump has lost three times and whose mail balloting system he has often criticized despite no evidence of any widespread fraud or other voting-related problems. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state’s voting process “RIGGED” and warned that it was “under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!” AP AUDIO: Bomb threats in New Jersey and Trump warnings for California mark final day of voting AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on disruptions at polling centers in New Jersey. Claims of election rigging are almost routine for Trump in the run-up to elections and sometimes on the day of voting itself. On Election Day last year, before he was declared the winner, he claimed without providing any details or evidence that there was “talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia” and said law enforcement was on the way. He continues to lie about his loss in the 2020 presidential election . California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been championing the redistricting initiative, responded to Trump with his own social media post calling the president “A totally unserious person spreading false information in a desperate attempt to cope with his failures.” Secretary of State Shirley Weber called it “another baseless claim.” “The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,” she said in a statement. “California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.” In Virginia as the polls closed, Susan Beals, commissioner of elections, thanked officials for running a “very smooth election.” Beals said there was a power outage in Virginia Beach, but the voting machine had battery backup and emergency lights came on so voting continued. In New Jersey, law enforcement and election officials acted swiftly as voting began to secure polling places following a series of bomb threats. Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who also serves as the state’s top election official, said the threats had been emailed to seven counties, including Passaic, a key swing county. It also is the only county outside California where the Department of Justice had sent election monitors , in both cases at the request of the Republican parties in each state. “Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,” Way said. “We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and coordinate closely with state, local and federal partners to ensure a smooth and safe election.” Later in the day, authorities arrested a juvenile suspect in connection with some of the bomb threats. The potential charges were not immediately released. A New Jersey judge granted a one-hour extension for voters to be able to cast ballots at some polling places in Passaic County. The threats came as the final day of voting began in New Jersey’s closely-watched race for governor and a year after a series of bomb threats disrupted voting during last year’s presidential election, mostly in battleground states. Bomb threat hoaxes also circulated in Springfield, Ohio , last year after Donald Trump during the campaign amplified false claims of Haitian immigrants there abducting and eating pets. The threats Tuesday involved nearly two dozen polling places in Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Passaic counties, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. Some polling places reopened quickly, he said, while voters at others were directed to nearby locations to cast their ballots. “Law enforcement officers have responded at each affected polling place, and they have worked swiftly to secure these polling locations and ensure the safety of every voter,” Platkin said. The FBI’s Newark office said it was aware of the reports and was assisting the state and local agencies. “This Dept. of Justice is committed to free, fair and safe elections,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post related to the bomb threat investigation. Passaic County received three threats and redirected some affected voters to other locations early Tuesday, county spokesperson Lindsay Reed said in an email. One location, a school building, was cleared and voting resumed. In Pennsylvania, nearly 20% of voters in Chester County were left out of the poll books originally provided to polling locations Tuesday, county officials said. That included voters registered as anything other than a Republican or a Democrat, including those registered with the Green or Libertarian parties or independents with no party affiliation. The category includes about 75,000 registered voters out of roughly 385,000 countywide. A Chester County judge later extended voting by provisional ballot to 10 p.m. at all polling locations. Election officials in the Democratic-leaning county located about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) west of Philadelphia became aware of the problem just after polling places opened and had provided supplemental poll books to all 230 polling locations by late afternoon. There will be a formal review. A majority of Chester County voters backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump in last year’s presidential election. Voters on Tuesday were weighing in on local offices, as well as on members of Pennsylvania’s highest court . Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court were running in nonpartisan retention elections, in which voters give a “yes” or “no” on whether they serve another term. Third-party and independent voters who came to cast ballots before supplemental poll books arrived were offered a provisional ballot. County review boards consider the status of provisional ballots within seven days of Election Day. ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio, and Fingerhut from Des Moines, Iowa.

(AP) — The Kansas House’s top Republican on Tuesday dropped efforts to force a redraw of U.S. House districts that would have thrust the state into a widening national battle for partisan advantage in the 2026 elections. The announcement by House Speaker Dan Hawkins ended a weekslong push by GOP lawmakers to circumvent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and call themselves into a special session on redistricting, which would have convened Friday. A session would have targeted four-term U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in the state’s four-person House delegation. Republicans still could draw a map designed to oust her after the GOP-supermajority Legislature convenes its next regular annual session in January. Indeed, state Senate President Ty Masterson promised immediately after Hawkins’ announcement that redistricting would be “a top priority” early next year. Kansas Republicans were trying to answer President Donald Trump’s call for states to redraw their maps to give the GOP more winnable seats ahead of the 2026 midterms so the party stands a better chance of keeping its slim House majority.

Follow on Some GOP critics opposed a mid-decade redistricting, while others feared that changes could make the three other Republican-held districts more competitive for Democrats. “Planning a Special Session is always going to be an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts and many unseen factors at play,” Hawkins said in a statement. Davids conceded that the fight over a new Kansas map isn’t over. “We’ve won the first round in this fight against gerrymandering,” she said in a statement. Kansas lawmakers haven’t done a mid-decade congressional redistricting since 1965, following federal court rulings requiring congressional and legislative districts to be as nearly equal in population as possible as a matter of fairness to all voters. Most of Davids’ district is in the Kansas City area, dominated by Johnson County, the state’s most populous county. It is highly likely that Republicans would have to split Johnson County between at least two districts to hurt Davids enough for her to lose in 2026 — and that could alienate voters there. Laurel Burchfield, advocacy director for the Mainstream Coalition, which opposes a mid-decade redistricting, said Kansas residents want GOP lawmakers to focus on economic issues and lowering costs for families. “Changing the maps mid-decade to rig the system in their favor is wrong,” Burchfield said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. GOP lawmakers in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have heeded the president’s call for new maps, creating seven additional Republican seats among them. California countered with an initiative on Tuesday’s ballot to pick up five Democratic seats there. In Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore announced Tuesday that he has formed a commission to consider mid-cycle redistricting despite the state Senate president saying last week that his chamber would not move forward with redistricting. Democrats hold seven of eight House seats there. In Kansas, it would have been only the second time in the state’s 164-year history that lawmakers bypassed the governor for a special session. The only previous time was in 2021, when Republicans sought to challenge federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates. GOP leaders circulated this year’s petition for weeks. Hawkins’ statement was titled, “Countdown to January 12th,” the date lawmakers open their next annual session. Hawkins said in his statement that most Republicans “wish to have a conversation about redistricting.” GOP lawmakers would still have time to get a new map into law. The state’s candidate filing deadline isn’t until June 1, and the primary election is Aug. 4. Davids has said she expects to challenge a new congressional map in court. She also is considering a run for the U.S. Senate next year against incumbent Republican Roger Marshall if her district is redrawn. “Every option is on the table, including a statewide race,” Davids said during a recent Zoom news conference. ___ Associated Press journalist Brian Witte contributed reporting from Annapolis, Maryland."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before starting cancer immunotherapy is linked to significantly improved survival in patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean by killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica\n\nHurricane Melissa is pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing around 50 people with the death toll expected to rise.

and Cuba for days, leaving a trail of devastation that killed about 50 people.\n\nThe hurricane smashed into Jamaica with enormous force on Tuesday as a Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down.

Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP.

It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees.

offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/thousands-evacuated-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-approaches-the-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:20:14+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuated as Typhoon Kalmaegi approaches the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As Typhoon Kalmaegi approaches the eastern Philippines, over 70,000 people in coastal areas including Guiuan, Salcedo, and Mercedes have been evacuated due to severe weather threats such as storm surges, flooding, and wind gusts.

Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/birds-of-a-feather-trumps-endorsement-of-cuomo-divides-nyc-voters","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:55:54+00:00","title":"‘Birds of a feather’: Trump’s endorsement of Cuomo divides NYC voters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump’s endorsement of Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 New York City mayoral race sparked a significant shift in voter sentiment, especially among progressive and moderate voters.

endorsement of Cuomo divides NYC voters\n\nNew York City –  For Jessica Dejesus, deciding who to vote for as the next mayor of New York City came down to the final minutes.\n\nThe 40-year-old resident of the Mott Haven neighbourhood in the Bronx admittedly had not been following the race closely, but planned to vote for former Governor Andrew Cuomo. She recalled his near-nightly television appearances when he was governor of New York State amid the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“He was our guy during the pandemic,” she reflected.\n\nBut a day before the election, Dejesus saw a video on TikTok detailing US President Donald Trump’s  endorsement  of Cuomo.\n\nWhile her feelings towards the candidates in the mayoral race may be ho-hum, Dejesus knows she is no fan of Trump. The nod made her give upstart candidate Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, a closer look.\n\n“We can’t have that. I don’t disagree with everything Trump does, but he cut back on food stamps, and that affects a lot of people,” she said, referring to restrictions on US Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in a bill passed by Trump and Republicans earlier this year.\n\n“I understand you have to stop bad people coming over the border, but there are a lot of good immigrants here as well,” she said, referring to Trump’s mass deportation drive.\n\nWalking into her voting site, she told Al Jazeera she still had not made up her mind. “I’ll have to wait until that paper’s in front of me,” she said.\n\nMoments later, she emerged: “I voted for Mamdani!” she said.\n\nA neighbourhood like Mott Haven, which was solidly mixed during the June primary in its turnout for Mamdani and Cuomo, shows just how reactive Trump’s endorsement could be to the race: a poison pill for some and a final nail in the coffin for others.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hoped his endorsement, soon followed by that of billionaire Elon Musk, would help rally conservative New Yorkers who came out in atypically large numbers in the city’s 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump said in a social media post on Monday.\n\n“You must vote for him and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!”\n\nCuomo has also been  explicitly reaching out  to Republicans, hoping to court their votes. About 11 percent of New York’s 4.7 million voters were registered with the Republican Party in 2024.\n\nRecent polls have shown Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa carrying about 14 percent of the vote – not a huge amount, but potentially enough to close Mamdani’s lead over the former governor.\n\nIt remained unclear how successful the action from Trump – who has also  threatened  to target city funding if Mamdani was elected – would be. But for some staunch supporters of Sliwa, Trump’s intervention did little to change their minds.\n\n“[Trump’s endorsement] doesn’t change my vote. Sliwa is for the people and I have faith in that,” said Artemio Figuero, a 59-year-old city street cleaner, who spoke to Al Jazeera in Jackson Heights, Queens.\n\n“He was a protector of the neighbourhood,” Figuero added, referring to Sliwa’s stewardship of the vigilante anti-crime Guardian Angels group.\n\nOther Republicans who had long grown accustomed to voting outside of their party in the liberal-dominated local elections saw Trump’s support as a positive development, if not a game-changer.\n\n“I like that Trump endorsed him,” Lola Ferguson, a 53-year-old social worker and registered Republican who was already planning to vote for Cuomo, told Al Jazeera in Mott Haven.\n\n“He knows that [Cuomo’s] the better match for the city,” she said.\n\nCuomo, for his part, has denied Trump’s endorsement counts, noting that Trump had referred to him as a “bad Democrat” compared to Mamdani, whom he falsely called a “communist”.\n\nStill, for Mamdani supporters, Trump’s move was not unexpected. Cuomo has been supported by an array of the city’s wealthiest residents, including billionaires like Bill Ackman and Miriam Adelson, who have also backed Trump.\n\n“Birds of a feather flock together,” said Andre Augustine, a 33-year-old who works at a college access nonprofit, who voted for Mamdani.\n\n“I feel like the signs were already there. All the folks that were financing Trump’s campaign were also financing Cuomo’s, and I feel like [Cuomo] just wouldn’t be honest about it,” he said.\n\nFor others, Trump’s endorsement was the feather that broke the camel’s back.\n\nDominique Witter, 39, a healthcare tech consultant, respected Cuomo’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, but had been gradually shifting towards Mamdani.\n\nShe did not decide on Mamdani until the final sprint of the race.\n\n“It took me a while to get there, but I’m voting for Mamdani,” she told Al Jazeera as she prepared to vote in Mott Haven.\n\n“I’m not gonna lie; the Trump endorsement did not help. Because that’s not what we want, right?” she said.\n\n“Oh no, that’s not an endorsement you want.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/avalanche-hits-nepals-mount-yalung-ri-killing-seven-climbers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"02:55:07+00:00","title":"Avalanche hits Nepal’s Mount Yalung Ri, killing seven climbers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in eastern Nepal’s Rolwaling Valley killed at least seven climbers, including five foreigners—three French, one Canadian, one Italian, and two Nepalis—while they were ascending the 5,630-meter peak.

seven people, including five foreigners, have been killed in eastern Nepal after an avalanche swept through a camp on Mount Yalung Ri, according to media reports.\n\nThe Kathmandu Post, citing local officials, reported on Tuesday that the avalanche hit the team of 15 people as they were ascending the 5,630-metre (18,471-foot) mountain of Yalung Ri, and that four members of the expedition remain remaining.\n\n“The avalanche buried everyone on the slope,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the Kathmandu Post. “We got the information late, and the difficult weather delayed immediate response.”\n\nMahato said that three French climbers, one Canadian, one Italian and two Nepalis were killed in the incident.\n\nFour Nepali climbers who were injured have been evacuated, while four others, also from Nepal, remain missing, the Kathmandu Post reported.\n\nOne of the injured climbers told the newspaper that the climbers had called for help but got no response for hours.\n\n“We shouted and cried for help, but no one could reach us,” the unnamed climber said. “We were told that a helicopter would come after four hours, but by then, several of our friends were gone.”\n\nYalung Ri is located in the Rolwaling Valley of northeastern Nepal, and climbers there encounter a mix of rock, ice and snow.\n\nBefore Monday’s tragedy, the valley had experienced continuous snow and poor weather conditions for several days, according to the Kathmandu Post.\n\nMahato, the police officer, said helicopters could not be flown in the area due to heavy snowfall and clouds but an aircraft finally reached the area on Monday evening.\n\nHe added that rescue teams on foot have also been dispatched to the area, and that the search operation would resume on Tuesday morning.\n\nNepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including  Mount Everest , and welcomes hundreds of climbers and trekkers every year.\n\nAutumn expeditions on the Himalayan mountains in October and November are less popular because of the shorter, colder days, snowy terrain and a narrow summit window compared with the busy spring season, which runs from April to May.\n\nLast week,  Cyclone Montha  triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, leaving trekkers and tourists stranded on popular Himalayan trekking routes.\n\nSeparately, two Italian climbers have also gone missing while scaling a remote peak in western Nepal, tourism officials said on Monday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/race-against-time-palestinians-suffer-from-hunger-in-gaza-despite-truce","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"22:14:13+00:00","title":"'Race

hunger in Gaza despite truce\n\nAid agencies are in “a race against time” to get food and other humanitarian supplies into  the Gaza Strip , a United Nations official has warned, as Israeli restrictions continue to impede deliveries across the bombarded enclave.\n\nSpeaking during a news briefing on Tuesday, a senior spokesperson for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) noted that aid deliveries have increased since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect last month.\n\nBut only two  crossings into Gaza  are open, which “severely limits the quantity of aid” that the WFP and other agencies can bring in, said Abeer Etefa.\n\n“We need full access. We need everything to be moving fast. We are in a race against time. The winter months are coming. People are still suffering from hunger, and the needs are overwhelming,” she said.\n\nWFP, which currently operates 44 food distribution points across Gaza, said it has provided food parcels to more than one million Palestinians in the territory since the ceasefire began on October 10.\n\nBut Etefa told reporters that the amount of food getting into Gaza remains insufficient, and reaching northern Gaza, where the world’s top hunger monitor  confirmed famine conditions  in August, remains a challenge.\n\n“A major obstacle is the continued closure of the northern crossings into the Gaza Strip. Aid convoys are obliged to follow a slow, difficult route from the south,” she said.\n\n“To deliver at scale, WFP needs all crossings to be open, especially those in the north. Full access to key roads across Gaza is also critical to allow food to be transported quickly and efficiently to where it is needed.”\n\nThousands of Palestinians have  returned to their homes  in Gaza’s north in recent weeks as the Israeli army withdrew to the so-called “yellow line” as part of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nBut most found their homes and neighbourhoods completely destroyed as a result of Israel’s two-year bombardment. Many families remain displaced and have been forced to live in tents and other makeshift shelters.\n\nKhalid al-Dahdouh, a Palestinian father of five, returned to Gaza City to find his house in ruins. He has since built his family a small shelter, using bricks salvaged from the rubble and held together with mud.\n\n“We tried to rebuild because winter is coming,” he  told Al Jazeera .\n\n“We don’t have tents or anything else, so we built a primitive structure out of mud since there is no cement … It protects us from the cold, insects and rain – unlike the tents.”\n\nThe UN and other aid agencies have been urging Israel to allow more supplies into the Strip, as outlined in the ceasefire agreement, particularly as Palestinians are set to face harsh conditions during the colder winter months.\n\nOn Saturday, Gaza’s Government  Media Office said  that 3,203 commercial and aid trucks brought supplies into Gaza between October 10 and 31, an average of 145 aid trucks per day, or just 24 percent of the 600 trucks that are meant to be entering daily as part of the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli army has continued to carry out attacks on Gaza, as well as demolishing homes and other structures.\n\nOne person was killed and another wounded on Tuesday after an Israeli quadcopter opened fire in the Tuffah neighbourhood east of Gaza City. A source at al-Ahli Arab Hospital also told Al Jazeera that a person was killed by Israeli army fire in northern Gaza’s Jabalia.\n\nAt least 240  Palestinians have been killed  and 607 others wounded in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire came into effect, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\n\nIsraeli leaders have rejected criticism of those attacks and of continued restrictions on humanitarian aid, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal by not releasing all the bodies of deceased Israeli captives from the territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel said it received the remains of an Israeli captive after Hamas handed them over to the International Committee of the Red Cross."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/rsf-digging-mass-graves-in-sudans-el-fasher-to-clean-up-massacre-expert","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"23:03:15Z","title":"RSF digging mass graves in Sudan’s el-Fasher to ‘clean up massacre’: Expert","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a Sudanese paramilitary group, are accused of digging mass graves in el-Fasher, Sudan, to conceal mass killings that occurred after seizing control of the city on October 26, 2023.

region that has seen mass killings and displacement since the RSF took over last month.\n\nNathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale’s School of Public Health, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the RSF “have begun to dig mass graves and to collect bodies throughout the city”.\n\n“They are cleaning up the massacre,” Raymond said.\n\nThe RSF seized control of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, on October 26, after the withdrawal of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which has been fighting the paramilitary group for control of Sudan  since April 2023 .\n\nMore than 70,000 people have fled the city and surrounding areas since the RSF’s takeover, according to the  United Nations , while witnesses and human rights groups have reported cases of “summary executions”, sexual violence and massacres of civilians.\n\nA report from Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab on October 28 also found  evidence of “mass killings”  since the RSF took control of el-Fasher, including apparent pools of blood that were visible in satellite imagery.\n\nUN officials also  warned  this week that thousands of people are believed to be trapped in el-Fasher.\n\n“The current insecurity continues to block access, preventing the delivery of life-saving assistance to those trapped in the city without food, water and medical care,” Jacqueline Wilma Parlevliet, a senior UN refugee agency (UNHCR) official in Sudan, said.\n\nSudanese journalist Abdallah Hussain explained that, before the RSF’s full takeover, el-Fasher was already reeling from an 18-month siege imposed by the paramilitary group.\n\n“No aid was allowed to access the city, and no healthcare facilities [were] operating,” Hussain told Al Jazeera from the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, on Tuesday. “Now it’s getting even worse for the citizens who remain trapped.”\n\nAmid global condemnation, the RSF and its supporters have tried to downplay the atrocities committed in el-Fasher, accusing  allied armed groups  of being responsible.\n\nThe RSF’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, has also promised an investigation.\n\nBut Raymond at the Humanitarian Research Lab said: “if they want to actually have an investigation, then they need to withdraw from the city [and] let UN personnel and the Red Cross and humanitarians enter … and go house-to-house looking to see who’s still alive”.\n\n“At this point, we can’t let the RSF investigate themselves,” he said.\n\nRaymond added that, based on UN figures and what can be seen on the ground in el-Fasher, “more people could have died [in 10 days]… than have died in the  past two years  of the war in Gaza”.\n\n“That’s what we’re talking about.

Following the rulings, the Trump administration  said on Monday  that it would partially fund the country’s flagship food aid scheme, falling back on about $5bn set aside in emergency reserves.\n\nHowever, the president appeared to walk back his administration’s plans with a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, saying he would only fund SNAP once the government reopens.\n\n“SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly “handed” to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” the president  posted  on Tuesday morning.\n\nSNAP, known colloquially as food stamps, costs more than $8bn to deploy monthly. A person in the programme receives an average of about $190 each month, while a household receives an average monthly benefit of $356 in groceries. The benefits are typically loaded onto debit cards.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to contradict the president’s social media post on Tuesday afternoon, saying the administration is “fully complying with the court order”, but that releasing the funds will not be a quick process.\n\n“The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand [that] it’s going to take some time to receive this money,” Leavitt said. “The president does not want to have to continue to dip into a contingency fund that doesn’t even have enough money, by the way, to fund the full programme.”\n\nThe USDA on Monday said that, in light of the ruling by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, one of the judges to initially order the administration to fund SNAP, it would use the contingency funding to pay SNAP recipients 50 percent of their typical allotment, calling it a “cumbersome process” that would result in delayed benefits.\n\nLawyers at the liberal legal group Democracy Forward, in a motion on Tuesday, told McConnell that the USDA’s statement about delays demonstrated that the administration had failed to resolve the “burdens” entailed by making only partial benefits available.\n\n“Time is of the essence when it comes to hunger,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nLeavitt repeatedly branded the shutdown as a Democrat-led endeavour in her news conference on Tuesday, claiming that the party is willing to hurt the country to score political points.\n\n“The Democrats are intentionally hurting American families, businesses and workers with this shutdown to fight for free healthcare for illegal aliens to appease their radical left-wing base,” she said.\n\nMore than 42 million Americans rely on food assistance. Until court-ordered to do so, the Trump administration had said it would not use emergency funds to prop up the programme.\n\nThe US  government shutdown  began on October 1 when Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a funding bill. Since then, both parties have failed 14 times to agree on a stopgap funding measure.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate voted 54-44 against a “clean” continuing resolution, which had passed the House of Representatives, that would have funded the government through November 21.\n\nDemocrats hold a minority in both houses of Congress, and they are trying to use the spending bill to force Republicans to negotiate on critical healthcare spending.\n\nDemocrats want Congress to extend expiring subsidies before the US healthcare enrolment period begins in November and reverse cuts to Medicaid assistance for low-income people and those with disabilities."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a significant advancement in its space capabilities.

the EU’s executive branch, presented a series of enlargement reports Tuesday, evaluating the fitness of possible new members, including Ukraine, Serbia and Montenegro.

The commission noted that the agencies and civil society groups report growing pressure from the state and security services, saying “These developments cast doubts on Ukraine’s commitment to its anticorruption agenda.”\n\nDespite lingering questions on Kyiv’s work to end corruption, Kos told the commission she wants approval for Ukraine and Moldova to press on with formal negotiations.\n\n“We have implemented the widest, the broadest anticorruption infrastructure in Europe,” Zelenskyy told Brussels Tuesday. “And I don’t know about any country who has that many anticorruption authorities.

with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/hunger-crisis-deepens-in-south-sudan-amid-conflict-floods-monitor-says","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:24:34Z","title":"Hunger crisis deepens in South Sudan amid conflict, floods, monitor says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The hunger crisis in South Sudan is deepening due to renewed fighting between government forces and militias aligned with First Vice President Riek Machar, who is currently facing treason charges and detention.

conflict, floods, monitor says\n\nMore than 7.55 million people in South Sudan will face malnutrition during next year’s April-to-July lean season, when food supplies are usually lower, according to a global hunger monitor.\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed food security watchdog, issued the stark warning on Tuesday, projecting that hunger will worsen dramatically in the coming months as fighting between rival political factions intensifies and global aid funding dwindles.\n\nThe assessment comes as the country teeters on the brink of renewed civil war following President Salva Kiir’s suspension of his main political rival and First Vice President Riek Machar, who faces trial on treason charges.\n\nAbout 5.97 million South Sudanese, 42 percent of the population analysed, are currently facing acute malnutrition, the IPC said.\n\nSome 28,000 people in Luakpiny Nasir and Fangak are already classified as living in catastrophic conditions, the IPC’s most severe category, amid persistent conflict and flooding.\n\nSix counties are projected to hit the most critical levels of acute malnutrition in 2026, primarily due to conflict-driven displacement and restricted access to food, water and health services, as well as a spreading cholera outbreak, the report said.\n\nMore than 2.1 million children under five and 1.15 million pregnant and breastfeeding women are at risk of acute malnutrition by June 2026, it said.\n\n“The high severity of acute food insecurity in South Sudan is of great concern, requiring an immediate and large-scale response to save lives,” the IPC report said.\n\nHumanitarian access remains one of the most critical challenges, the report said. In many areas across the country, insecurity, looting and flooding have isolated entire communities for months, it said.\n\n“This is an alarming trajectory,” said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the World Food Programme’s country director in South Sudan.\n\n“The persistent hunger levels remain deeply troubling. In counties where peace has held, and actors have consistent access, as well as resources, people have taken the first steps towards recovery. While this progress is encouraging, it is crucial that we sustain the momentum to ensure lasting positive change across all affected communities.”\n\nThe hunger emergency stems from a cascade of crises. Renewed fighting between government forces and militias aligned with Machar has killed nearly 2,000 people this year and displaced more than 445,000, according to International Committee of the Red Cross figures.\n\nSince its independence in 2011, South Sudan has cycled through civil war, fragile peace deals, and ongoing political instability, leading to a range of humanitarian emergencies.\n\nWithin two years of independence, President Kiir, from the majority Dinka ethnic group, dismissed Machar, a Nuer from the country’s second-largest community, leading to a civil war along ethnic lines that killed an estimated 400,000 people.\n\nA 2018 peace deal restored a weak power-sharing arrangement, but its provisions were not properly implemented. The agreement is facing its most serious recent test amid Machar’s imprisonment and trial."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/at-least-three-killed-in-ups-cargo-plane-crash-at-louisville-airport-in-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"03:13:31+00:00","title":"At least 7 killed in UPS cargo plane crash at Louisville airport in US","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large UPS cargo plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, crashed during takeoff at Louisville’s Muhammad Ali Airport on November 4, 2025, killing at least seven people, four of whom were not on the aircraft.

mosquitoes to Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/belgian-airports-disrupted-by-unidentified-drone-flights","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"03:38:24+00:00","title":"Belgian airports disrupted by unidentified drone flights","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Belgian airports, including Brussels and Liege, were severely disrupted by unidentified drone sightings on Tuesday evening, resulting in multiple operational shutdowns, flight delays, and cancellations.

won the race to lead the largest city in the United States, the Associated Press projected late on Tuesday, soon after polls closed in a heated contest that grabbed the world’s attention.\n\nThe victory on Sunday beckons in history for the city of more than 8.4 million people, an economic and cultural powerhouse with international prominence.\n\nMamdani is the first Muslim, the first person of South Asian descent and the first person born in Africa to lead the city.\n\n“Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it. The future is in our hands,” the 34-year-old state assemblyman and newly minted mayor-elect told a crowd of cheering supporters. “My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty.”\n\n“New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change, a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford,” he said.\n\nWith 90 percent of the votes counted, Mamdani had an approximately nine percentage point lead over Cuomo, receiving 1,033,471 votes, compared to the former governor’s 852,032 votes. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa was carrying about seven percent of the tallied votes.\n\nWhile voters across the vastly diverse metropolis have hailed the progress of Mamdani’s historic win, most of his  ardent base has been clear : It is not about his religion or ethnic identity; it is about his laser-focused message of affordability.\n\nIn front of a sea of campaign signs and yellow beanies, Mamdani appealed to the diverse coalition he mobilised.\n\n“I speak of Yemeni Bodega owners and Mexican abuelas, Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties…to every New Yorker in Kensington and Midwood and Hunts Point,” he said.\n\n“This city is your city, and this democracy is yours too,” he said.\n\nThe race has also taken on a dimension as a bellwether for the future of Democratic politics, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo representing , to many, the wealthy  donor-dominated establishment  of the past,  and Mamdani, an avowed democratic socialist, representing a possible way forward for the party.\n\nCuomo did not mince words on Tuesday as he cast his ballot, calling it a “civil war in the Democratic Party that has been brewing for a while”.\n\n“You have an extreme radical left that is run by the socialists that is challenging, quote unquote, moderate Democrats,” said Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing the Democratic primary in June to Mamdani.\n\n“And that contest is what you’re seeing here.”\n\nHours later he conceded defeat, telling supporters at his own election watch party, “tonight was their night”.\n\nReferencing the inter-party schism in his victory speech, Mamdani was defiant.\n\n“I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older,” he told supporters.\n\n“I am Muslim. I am a Democratic socialist, and most damning of all, I refuse to apologizse for any of this,” he said.\n\nFor Joshua Wilson, a social worker who cast a ballot for Mamdani in the Mott Haven neighbourhood of the Bronx, Cuomo was right on the mark.\n\n“During Donald Trump’s second presidency, all eyes are on New York and all eyes are on the United States. Everything is politicised, and it’s so much more vitriolic,” Wilson said.\n\n“There’s also this big push against younger voices coming in. People are really scared and want to, like, be conservative. They want to keep things the way that they are,” the 33-year-old said.\n\nLucy Cordero, a 68-year-old from the neighbourhood, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We’ve seen Cuomo, we know who he is, and he hasn’t been a great person,” she said. “I picked Mamdani because he’s new and he’s fresh. Maybe he can make a change and fix what’s messed up now”.\n\nTrump endorsed Cuomo in the final hours of the race, a move meant to galvanise conservative voters, which  may have backfired .\n\nIn the Crown Heights neighbourhood in Brooklyn, Megan Marks, 52, a freelancer, said Mamdani skews farther left than she does.\n\nStill, she saw his bold platform as a counterpoint to federal politics, dominated by Republicans and US President Donald Trump.\n\n“I feel like we have nothing to lose. He’s idealistic and a little young,” Marks said.\n\n“We might as well balance what is happening in the country by having someone from a very different perspective, so I’ve decided to get behind him [Mamdani],” she said.\n\nEven former Cuomo supporters were not immune to the buzz surrounding Mamdani’s campaign.\n\n“In the primary, I did not vote for [Mamdani], but I changed my vote to him after some reflection,” Alex Lawerance, a 55-year-old lawyer from Crown Heights, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I’m not as progressive as [Mamdani], but he has a positive message, he has integrity, and I think he will do a fine job. I want to give the guy a chance.”\n\nIftikar Khan, 60, a driver originally from Bangladesh, pointed to the massive coalition of Muslim and South Asian voters that Mamdani has mobilised in the race.\n\nMany see his victory as emblematic of a new political renaissance for Muslims in the city, who faced a fever-pitch of discrimination in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nMamdani’s staunch  support for Palestinian rights  – a departure from both mainstream Democrats and former New York City mayors – has also galvanised support.\n\n“My family convinced me. They really love Mamdani,” Khan, a registered Republican and Trump supporter, who voted for Mamdani on Tuesday, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“My family really wanted Mamdani, so I said ‘OK’,” he said.\n\nSeveral questions remain over how Mamdani will enact his  ambitious vision .\n\nOn his affordability mission, he has pledged free buses, universal childcare and rent freezes on stabilised units.\n\nHis plan envisions paying for some of these programmes through increased taxes on corporations and wealthy residents. That would require building a coalition of support not just in New York City, but in the state legislature.\n\nWhen he takes office, he will also face a balancing act as he courts support from moderates while  not alienating  his progressive base, including the Democratic Socialists of America, an organisation that has helped raise a volunteer army numbering more than 100,000 people.\n\nNationally, some top Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have continued to withhold support for Mamdani, even as he faces threats from Trump over federal funding and the deployment of the National Guard.\n\nIn the Bronx, 33-year-old Andre Augustine held no illusions about the challenges ahead for Mamdani.\n\n“I’m not gonna say that it’s gonna be easy, but I think having a vision is very important,” he said.\n\n“I feel like it’s going to be hard, but I also think we’re going to put a lot of pressure on him. We’re going to hold him accountable,” he said.\n\n“But I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said.\n\nBack in the theater in Brooklyn, Mamdani hailed that voter optimism, thanking those who “allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible”.\n\nHe vowed to build a coalition, including Jewish New Yorkers and Muslims, to beckon in a “new age” of bold leadership.\n\n“No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election,” he said in a veiled reference to Cuomo’s attacks throughout the race.\n\nHe then turned to Trump, who has surged immigration enforcement to the city, threatened to withhold funding, and deploy the National Guard.\n\n“New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” Mamdani said.\n\n“So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:05:28+00:00","title":"World ‘very likely’ to exceed 1.5C climate goal in next decade: UN","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that global warming will exceed the 1.5°C target set under the Paris Agreement within the next decade, with current policies projecting warming of 2.3 to 2.5°C by 2100.

warming  by as much as 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, far below what is needed to tackle the climate crisis despite a raft of pledges, the United Nations has warned.\n\nIn its annual Emissions Gap Report on Tuesday, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said the world would exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, the report said. However, with the policies currently in place, Earth is expected to be 2.8C (5F) hotter in that time span.\n\n“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.”\n\nThe findings come just days before world leaders are set to converge for a UN climate conference in Brazil,  COP30 , where the global failure so far to tackle the crisis will loom large.\n\nGlobal emissions grew 2.3 percent in 2024 compared to the previous year, an increase driven by India followed by China, Russia and Indonesia, Tuesday’s report found.\n\nBut wealthy and powerful Group of 20 (G20) economies accounted for three-quarters of global emissions, and of the six largest polluters, the European Union was the only one to cut greenhouse gases last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States under President Donald Trump has moved away from its climate commitments, and  the country’s planned withdrawal  from the Paris Agreement will be official early next year.\n\nThe Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back  environmental regulations  to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, UNEP said in its report.\n\nThe UN agency also said the rest of the world must cut an additional two billion tonnes a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing US carbon pollution.\n\nScientists are in broad agreement that warming above 1.5C (2.7F) relative to pre-industrial times risks  catastrophic consequences , and every effort must be made to stick as close as possible to that safer threshold.\n\nAt 1.4C (2.5F) above pre-industrial times, the Earth is already too warm for most tropical coral reefs to survive, while ice sheets and the Amazon rainforest could suffer severe and lasting changes below 2C (3.6F), with consequences for the entire planet.\n\n“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate UN scientific panel that calculates climate impacts.\n\n“It is particularly important for those  vulnerable communities  and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” she told The Associated Press news agency.\n\n“It matters in  heatwaves . It matters in ocean heatwaves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long term when we think about sea level rise.”\n\nIn its report, the UN said only 60 parties to the Paris Agreement – accounting for 63 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions – had submitted or announced new mitigation targets for 2035 by an end-of-September deadline.\n\nIt urged world leaders to make “decisive, accelerated” reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions to minimise the projected overshoot of 1.5C (2.7F).\n\n“Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees is now inevitable – starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a livable future gets steeper by the day,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement on the report.\n\n“But this is no reason to surrender. It’s a reason to step up and speed up.[Achieving] 1.5 degrees by the end of the century remains our North Star. And the science is clear: this goal is still within reach. But only if we meaningfully increase our ambition.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1350","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"01:45:16+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,350","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 5, 2025, the Russia-Ukraine war continues with intense fighting in eastern Ukraine, particularly in Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, where logistics and counteroffensives are key.

although that figure is expected to rise as search and rescue operations continue across the trail of destruction the storm left in its wake in the northern Caribbean.\n\nAuthorities in Haiti on Thursday reported at least 30 deaths and 20 missing. The impoverished nation was not directly hit but suffered days of torrential rains from the lumbering storm. Jamaica has reported 19 deaths, according to the Reuters news agency. The Dominican Republic has reported one death before the hurricane made landfall elsewhere.\n\nMelissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of up to 295 kilometres per hour (183 miles per hour). The hurricane did not hit the capital of Kingston, but it slammed into Jamaica’s western side, where it wrought “devastation”, according to government officials.\n\nMelissa later struck Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane before continuing on a path past the Bahamas on Wednesday night. It is due to pass within 60km (37 miles) of Bermuda, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm’s force has been felt across the Caribbean, bringing destructive winds, rain, and flooding even as its strength has steadily declined over the past week.\n\nAlthough Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola, did not sustain a direct hit, they both experienced heavy flooding, according to local reports.\n\nNo deaths have been reported yet in Cuba, although the eastern half of the island was heavily battered by strong winds, according to Reuters.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people remain without power across the Caribbean, including 70 percent of Jamaica’s electricity customers, the newswire said.\n\nRegional authorities are working to clean up downed trees and power lines and assess widespread infrastructure damage.\n\nUN agencies say they are still calculating the damage from Melissa, although preliminary assessments for Jamaica indicate a level of devastation “never seen before” by the island, according to UN Resident Coordinator Dennis Zulu.\n\nThe US State Department announced on Thursday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has deployed the US Disaster Assistance Response Team to assist Jamaica, Haiti, the Bahamas, and Cuba.\n\nExpert analysis by US weather forecaster AccuWeather estimated that “preliminary damage and economic loss” from Melissa could range from $48-52bn."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zn4ln85ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:01:47.914+00:00","title":"Stone tool discovery suggests very first humans were inventors","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A discovery at the Namorotukunan archaeological site in northwest Kenya reveals that early hominins used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years, beginning as early as 2.75 million years ago.

When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.\"\n\nArchaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method.\n\nThe same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil.\n\n\"What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"These  guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them.\"\n\nGeological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate.\n\nThe landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,\" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.\n\nThese sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away.  But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food.\"\n\nThe evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them.\n\nAnd this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.\"\n\nThere is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance.\n\n\"The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier.\n\n\"They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.\"\n\nAt around 2.75 million years ago, the region was populated by some of the very first humans, who had relatively small brains. These early humans are thought to have lived alongside their evolutionary ancestors: a pre-human group, called australopithecines, who had larger teeth and a mix of chimpanzee and human traits.\n\nThe tool users at Namorotukunan were most likely one of these groups or possibly both.\n\nAnd the finding challenges the notion held by many experts in human evolution that continuous tool use emerged much later, between 2.4 and 2.2 million years ago, when humans had evolved relatively larger brains, according to Prof Braun.\n\n\"The argument is that we're looking at a pretty substantial brain size increase. And so, often the assertion has been that tool use allowed them to feed this large brain.\n\n\"But what we're seeing at Namorotukunan is that these really early tools are used before that brain size increase.\"\n\n\"We have probably vastly underestimated these early humans and human ancestors. We can actually trace the roots of our ability to adapt to change by using technology much earlier than we thought, all the way to 2.75 million years ago, and probably much earlier.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86gneqvz1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"04:00:53.265+00:00","title":"Kentucky plane crash: What we know about deadly Louisville cargo plane crash","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A cargo plane operated by UPS crashed during takeoff at Louisville International Airport on Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring 11 others.

2025-11-04T23:06:44.946+00:00\n\nTitle: Six takeaways from Canada's federal budget\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has introduced his first federal budget - a blueprint for how he plans to deliver on his promise to make Canada's economy the strongest in the G7.\n\nThe ambitious plan,  seen as a key test of the new leader and former central banker, is as much a political document as a spending blueprint.\n\nIt warns that Canada is in an era of \"significant change\" not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall, which is underscored by its rapidly shifting relationship with the US, once the country's closest ally.\n\n\"There's some headwinds on the horizon,\" Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \"That's why we need a strong response.\"\n\nHere are six takeaways from the spending plan.\n\nThe budget includes billions of dollars in spending that could balloon Canada's deficit to C$78.3bn (£42.6bn) - the second biggest on record.\n\nCarney and Finance Minister Champagne have defended the massive spending plan,  which will total C$280bn, as an investment to help boost Canada's global competitiveness and argued that a strategic injection of funds will attract C$1tn in investment back to Canada in the next five years.\n\nIt will fund a broad range of areas:  highways, ports, electrical grids, digital corridors, defence, housing, and initiatives promised to boost Canada's productivity.\n\nBut Carney has also warned Canadians of necessary \"sacrifices\" in his plan to transform the economy, with the budget projecting C$60bn in total spending cuts in the next five years.\n\nThey come in part from a reduction of 40,000 jobs in the public sector by the end of 2029 - about 10% of the workforce to be trimmed through attrition, job cuts and the widespread adoption of AI.\n\nFederal ministries could see up to 15% cuts in the coming years, expected to account for more than C$44bn in savings, according to the budget.\n\nFor the first time in Canada, the fiscal plan drew distinctions between government spending by operational spending - day-to-day government spending - and capital investment, defined as funding that should help grow the economy.\n\nDue to its proximity and close cultural ties, the US has long been Canada's largest trading partner, with about 70% of trade moving south.\n\nIn the wake of Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty that came with them, Canada is looking to Europe and Asia, with the aim of doubling non-US exports over the next decade.\n\nCarney's budget proposes millions in backing for businesses working to develop new export markets, and includes help with legal expenses and market research.\n\nThere is also a nod to growing cultural ties with Europe, like exploring Canada's participation in the Eurovision song contest.\n\nWith some firms hoping to save on trade costs by moving facilities south to the US, Carney is also proposing  a raft of initiatives to make Canada more attractive. That includes a suite of measures that would lower Canada's marginal effective tax rate to 13.2% from 15.6%.\n\n\"This is a great message for investors,\" said Champagne, noting the rate will be lower than that in the US.\n\nAnd with many US universities facing uncertain funding under the Trump administration, the spending plan includes C$1.3bn to attract international researchers to Canadian universities, and money to support their research.\n\nLike other resource economies, Canada has grappled with balancing its need to increase production of commodities like oil and gas while maintaining its climate commitments. Oil-rich provinces like Alberta have lobbied the federal government to remove some enviromental initiatives, arguing they hurt development in the region.\n\nCarney's fiscal plan proposes making Canada a \"clean energy superpower\" by supporting the development of low-emission energy projects like nuclear reactors and low-carbon liquified natural gas.\n\nAt the same time, the government is pushing for the development of carbon capture and storage technologies, as well as enhanced methane regulations.\n\nIt is also affirming its commitment to the industrial carbon tax, calling it a policy \"that delivers more emissions reductions than any other\".\n\nTo encourage investment, the Carney government says it will work with provinces on what that carbon pricing would look like long-term to provide more stability to companies.\n\nThese initiatives would replace an oil and gas emissions cap introduced by Carney's predecessor, former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAll of this is billed under a Climate Competitiveness Strategy that the Carney government says is \"a central pillar of the plan for Canada to become the strongest economy in the G7\".\n\nCarney has pledged Canada will significantly boost defence spending to hit a Nato target of 2% of GDP this year and 5% by 2035, as the country grapples with an aggressive Russia and more powerful China, as well as threats to Arctic security.\n\nThe budget outlines C$81.8bn in defence spending over the next five years, the largest amount in decades for a country that has long lagged in military funding and struggled with procurement.\n\nSpending includes pay increases for the armed forces, funding for digital infrastructure, and plans to develop Canadian supply chains.\n\nThere is also C$182.6m over three years for the defence ministry to establish capability for space launches.\n\nAnother focus is the Arctic. The Carney government says it is eyeing the development of all-weather, dual-use infrastructure projects in Canada's north that can be used for both economic and security reasons, devoting  C$1bn over four years to the endeavour.\n\nCarney's first act as prime minister was getting rid of one of his predecessor's signature climate policies, the consumer carbon tax, which had become politically unpopular.\n\nHe has continued to break from Trudeau, who was in power for nearly a decade, pushing back the electric-vehicle sales mandate and cancelling a proposed increase on Canada's capital gains tax.\n\nThe budget shows another major break, on immigration.\n\nTrudeau drastically increased the number of immigrants allowed into Canada, before announcing a sharp cut last year when concerns arose over the growing numbers of people and possible stress on housing and social services.\n\nCarney's budget significantly cuts targets for new temporary residents from 673,650 to 385,000 next year, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. There is also a one-time measure to speed the transition of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent residents.\n\nOther Trudeau-era policies now scrapped include the \"2 Billion Trees\" programme announced in 2019, which saw only around 160 million trees planted by late 2024, and the end of the 2022 luxury tax on vehicles and aircraft priced at more than C$100,000 and boats above C$250,000.\n\nThe latter \"was costing more to administer\" than it collected in tax revenue, Champagne said.\n\nThe Trump administration's trade war is hitting a broad range of Canadian businesses, as it imposes a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods not covered by a free trade agreement, along with sector-specific levies on steel, aluminium, lumber and automobiles.\n\nThe Carney government wants to spend C$5bn over the next five years to help these  sectors , including C$1bn to fund a transition for the steel industry towards new lines of business.\n\nIt is also launching a loan facility, valued at C$10bn, intended to support \"otherwise successful Canadian businesses\" as they weather tariff-related storms. The first loan recipient is Algoma Steel Inc, an Ontario-based producer that has faced layoffs since the US tariffs were imposed.\n\nA proposed Buy Canadian Policy will also prioritise procuring Canadian goods and suppliers for government-funded projects.\n\nPart of Canada's response to the tariffs will be funded by revenue it has raised from its own countermeasures to US levies. As of October 2025, Canada has made $6.5bn in gross revenues from those measures, according to the budget."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx4yjkzj4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"03:10:13.236+00:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi: At least 66 killed in the Philippines as storm wreaks havoc","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, caused catastrophic flooding and destruction across central Philippines, particularly in Cebu, resulting in at least 66 deaths and 26 missing, with most fatalities due to drowning.

Twenty-six others are missing, a civil defence official said in a radio interview on Wednesday.\n\nVideos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.\n\nThe official death toll includes   six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was   deployed to assist in relief efforts.\n\nThe aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\n\n\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said.

He will become the city's youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor and its first mayor born in Africa.\n\nHe entered the race last year with next to no name recognition, little money and no institutional party support.\n\nThat alone makes his victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Silwa remarkable.\n\nBut more than that, he represents the kind of politician that many in the Democratic Party's left have been seeking for years.\n\nHe is young and charismatic, with his generation's natural comfort with social media.\n\nHis ethnicity reflects the diversity of the party's base. He hasn't shied away from a political fight and has proudly espoused left-wing causes - such as free childcare, expanded public transportation and government intervention in free market systems.\n\nMamdani has also shown a laser-like ability to focus on the kind of core economic issues that have been a priority for working-class voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party recently, but he hasn't disavowed the left's cultural principles.\n\nBut critics have warned that such a candidate is unelectable in broad swathes of America - and Republicans have gleefully held the self-avowed democratic socialist up as the far-left face of the Democratic Party. Still, on Tuesday night in New York City, he was a winner.\n\nBy running against and defeating Cuomo, a former New York governor who is himself the son of a governor, he has vanquished the entrenched Democratic establishment viewed by many on the left as woefully out of touch with their party and their nation.\n\nBecause of this, Mamdani's campaign for mayor has generated voluminous media attention, perhaps more than a municipal election, even one for America's largest city, deserves.\n\nIt also means that, as mayor, his successes - and failures - will be closely scrutinised.\n\nTwelve years ago, Democrat Bill de Blasio won his race for mayor on a platform of addressing New York City's economic and social inequalities. Like Mamdani, Americans on the left had high hopes that his administration would provide a national example of effective liberal governance.\n\nDe Blasio, however, departed office eight years later widely unpopular and with a mixed record of achievements as he struggled with the limits of his mayoral power to implement new policies.\n\nMamdani will have to grapple with those same limits - and those same expectations.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat, has already said she opposed raising the kind of taxes necessary to fund Mamdami's ambitious agenda.\n\nAnd even with sufficient funding, Mamdani would not be able to implement programmes unilaterally.\n\nHe campaigned as a sharp critic of the corporate and business elite that call New York City their home, and have made Manhattan the financial capital of the world. To effectively govern, he will probably have to make some form of peace with those interests, however - a process he has already begun in recent weeks.\n\nHe has also condemned Israel's conduct during the Gaza war and pledged to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal if he sets foot in New York City, a promise that could be tested at some point during his term.\n\nAll those are problems for a later date, however. For now, Mamdani will need to set about the task of defining himself on the public stage - before his opponents do.\n\nWhile his campaign has generated national attention, he is still a blank slate for much of America.\n\nA recent CBS poll indicated that 46% of the American public were following the New York mayoral election \"not closely at all\". That provides both an opportunity and a challenge for Mamdani and the American left.\n\nConservatives from President Donald Trump down will be trying to paint the newly elected mayor as a socialist menace, whose policies and priorities will bring ruin to America's largest city and present a danger if embraced by the nation as a whole.\n\nThey will amplify every stumble and highlight every negative economic indicator or crime statistic.\n\nTrump, who has a personal connection to New York, is sure to welcome a political tussle with Mamdani and he has a wealth of ways to complicate life for the new mayor.\n\nMamdani will also be pressed to win over Democratic leaders, like New York senator and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who never backed his campaign.\n\nThe opportunity for Mamdani, however, is that he is not burdened by his past, which his political opponents unsuccessfully tried to wield against him during the campaign.\n\nWhen he is inaugurated in January, he will have the chance to build his political reputation from scratch. And if Trump does feud with him, he will only give Mamdani a larger platform on which to work.\n\nHis political talent and abilities have gotten him this far, which is no small feat. But that is nothing compared to the tests that await him in the years ahead.\n\nNew Yorkers like to think their city is the centre of the universe, but its mayoral race was not the only electoral contest taking place on Tuesday. In fact, it in all likelihood wasn't even Tuesday's best indication of the current electoral mood.\n\nBoth New Jersey and Virginia - states Democrat Kamala Harris narrowly carried against Trump last year - held governor elections. And in both cases, the Democrats won by more comfortable margins.\n\nThe New Jersey contest was closer and the final results suggest the inroads Trump made in the state last year among working class and minority voters did not hold up without the president's name on the ballot.\n\nUnlike Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger ran establishment-backed centrist campaigns with more modest policy prescriptions. All three, however, focused on affordability and cost-of-living issues. Exit polls showed the economy, once again, was the topic voters cared about most.\n\nWith Democrats on the left and centre winning on Tuesday, it may prove difficult for those looking to glean some insight on the kind of policies and candidates Democrats should advance to ensure future electoral success.\n\nLast week, however, Mamdani insisted there was plenty of room in the party for all kinds of viewpoints.\n\n\"I think this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,\" he said.\n\n\"To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.\"\n\nThat view will be put the test next year, as Democrats across the nation head to the polls to select their candidates for the congressional midterm elections. Tensions are sure to mount and traditional fault lines could re-emerge.\n\nFor one night, however, the Democrats are one big, happy party."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd04yde70jmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:17:44.070+00:00","title":"Carney's federal budget plans billions in new spending in response to US tariff shocks","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled a sweeping federal budget aimed at countering the economic fallout from US tariffs, particularly on steel, aluminum, and automobiles.

Carney's federal budget plans billions in new spending in response to US tariff shocks \n\nCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.\n\nBilled an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history.\n\nThe spending is   offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future.\n\nThe budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years.\n\nThe budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.\n\nPeppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles.\n\nThese levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty.\n\nTo counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\".\n\nThese include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.\n\nThe fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.\n\nRebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.\n\nBut she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\n\n\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said.\n\nAnd while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\n\n\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said.\n\nOn defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.\n\nThe Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.\n\nCarney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nImmigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.\n\nThe budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan.\n\nFailure to pass the budget could risk a federal election.\n\nOne Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.\n\nIn the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.\n\n​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.\n\nMeanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians.\n\nYves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget.\n\nMembers of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts.\n\nWith the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vpe8g3l3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:56:47.856+00:00","title":"What Trump took from Dick Cheney's political playbook","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article draws a parallel between Dick Cheney’s post-9/11 expansion of presidential power and Donald Trump’s current use of similar executive authority in foreign and domestic policy.

More than two decades later, Donald Trump is wielding the political levers Cheney constructed as a potent tool to advance his national priorities - even as the two men had nasty personal clashes over the direction of the Republican Party.\n\nCheney's experience in US government stretched back to Richard Nixon's White House, and he honed his theories of presidential powers over decades of experience in the corridors of power in Congress and during multiple Republican administrations.\n\nAs vice-president during the George W Bush administration, he used the Al-Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon – the most consequential moment of American national unity and clarity of purpose since the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack of World War Two – to restructure the foundations of executive authority.\n\n\"Cheney freed Bush to fight the 'war on terror' as he saw fit, driven by a shared belief that the government had to shake off old habits of self-restraint,\" former Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman writes in Angler, his 2008 book on Cheney's time as vice-president.\n\nNow Donald Trump, who has inherited those expanded presidential powers, is using them to pursue his own political agenda. It's an agenda that has shocked portions of the American public the way Cheney's once did, but one that has, at times, run counter to the policies and priorities Cheney once endorsed.\n\nAnd while Trump cites \"national emergencies\" to justify his actions, there is nothing near the national unity or sense of crisis that gripped America in the wake of 9/11.\n\nDespite spending decades concentrating power in the White House, in the later years of his life Cheney warned of the danger Trump posed to the nation, particularly after Trump's attempts to challenge his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. In 2024, Cheney said he supported Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n\"There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, called Cheney \"the king of endless, nonsensical wars, wasting lives and trillions of dollars\".\n\nThe parallels between Cheney and Trump and their expansive deployment of presidential authority, however, stretch across the breath of the American political landscape - in the use of American military power overseas, the ability to detain and transport non-citizens, and in the development and expanded use of US surveillance power, including focusing on perceived domestic threats.\n\n\"The powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned,\" Stephen Miller, a long-time Trump adviser who is now deputy chief of staff, said during a television interview in 2017. It's a line that could have been spoken by Cheney when he was at the pinnacle of American politics.\n\nWhile Trump has renounced Cheney's interventionist foreign policy and the Iraq War he oversaw, he – like Cheney – has demonstrated a willingness to use American military power abroad in ways that often flout attempts at oversight.\n\nHe launched  bombing strikes on Iran in June , which he justified with warnings of a growing nuclear threat from a regional adversary, echoing the very reasoning Cheney used at the start of the 2003 Iraq war.\n\nIn recent months, Trump's administration has designated narcotics traffickers as \"enemy combatants\" and is  undertaking an ongoing campaign  of destroying suspected drug-running boats in international waters. The deadly military attacks are necessary, they say, to protect American national security.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report, Trump's justice department has informed Congress that the White House does not need congressional approval to continue these strikes, despite requirements governing the use of force set out in the 1974 War Powers Resolution.\n\nCritics had accused Cheney's Bush administration of stretching the boundaries of the 2001 Authorisation of Military Force in the \"War on Terror\" to permit US military operations against suspected terrorists across the world. Now Trump is using similar means – drones and missiles – without even that slim cover of congressional approval.\n\nAnother key facet of Cheney's foreign policy was a reliance on \"extraordinary renditions\" of suspected terrorists captured abroad or on US soil in order to avoid US domestic courts from having jurisdiction over individual cases.\n\nThe Bush administration constructed a massive facility at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in order to indefinitely hold those individuals and struck deals with foreign governments to operate \"black sites\" where interrogations could be conducted without judges weighing in on the legality of the activities.\n\nDuring his second term in office, Trump has taken similar steps to avoid judicial review of his efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants on US soil. He has expanded the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to house deportees and struck deals with foreign governments to receive deported individuals.\n\nWhile some US courts have issued injunctions to stop the removals, they have had limited ability to review the merits of such actions.\n\n\"The constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Trump's lawyers argued in one case before the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump has also threatened to use domestic surveillance and investigatory capabilities of the US Department of Justice that Cheney enhanced and expanded more than 20 years ago to combat what he has called \"the enemy within\".\n\nWhile the Bush administration used these powers to infiltrate Muslim communities suspected of harbouring extremist views, Trump has called for a national crackdown on the loosely organised left-wing Antifa movement, which he says has resorted to violence in its demonstrations against the president's right-wing policies.\n\nThe government's surveillance powers have also been focused on foreign nationals with legal authorisation to enter the US – revoking residency permits and work visas for those the administration has deemed to hold anti-American or antisemitic views.\n\nWithin hours after Cheney's death on Tuesday, flags at the White House were lowered to half staff - a display of national mourning mandated by federal law. The move, however, obscures the dramatic rift that had formed between the conservative old guard of Cheney's era and the new Republican Party that Trump has fashioned in his image.\n\nWhile tributes to the late vice-president have rolled in at a steady pace, Trump has been notably silent.\n\nThe current president hasn't hesitated to criticise Cheney and his interventionist foreign policy views in the past, however. And he frequently clashed with Cheney's daughter, Liz, who became a vocal critic of Trump and in 2021 served as vice-chair of the congressional panel investigating his conduct during the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\nTrump and Cheney stood at loggerheads in the more than a decade since the latter left public office for the final time. Those clashes, however, were about policies and personality. On the power of the presidency – the scope of executive authority and the necessity for the White House to act forcefully when required – they were singing from the same hymnal.\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

But following protests, the court agreed to review its landmark ruling and put it on hold.\n\nThe current controversy centres around two idols of Dwarapalakas - or the door guards that stand just outside the sanctum sanctorum where the main deity sits.\n\nThe court took up the case in September after a report by the court-appointed Sabarimala Special Commissioner revealed that the idols were stripped of their gold-cladding in many places.\n\nIn a series of court orders since then, Justices Raja Vijayaraghavan V and KV Jayakumar say they have looked at the records submitted by temple officials, before-and-after photographs and other documents that the SIT has gathered into \"this extraordinary case involving the pilferage of Lord Ayyappa's sacred valuables\".\n\nThe judges said when they directed the temple officials to produce complete files and records relating to the repair of the idols, \"little did we realise, that we were in fact opening a hornet's nest\".\n\nTemple records show that 30.291kg gold - donated by now-disgraced billionaire businessman Vijay Mallya - was used in 1998-99 to carry out gold-cladding on the idols and several parts of the temple, including some pillars, door arches and panels depicting stories of Lord Ayyappa.\n\nThe court says that in July 2019, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) that manages the temple allowed the main suspect Unnikrishnan Potty - a former assistant priest at Sabarimala - to take out the idols for fresh gold-cladding.\n\nTwo months later when they were brought back, they were not weighed, but the court says that later investigations have revealed they were a lot lighter. Further investigation by the SIT has revealed pilferage also from the pedestals and door frames and the court says that approximately 4.54kg gold has gone missing since 2019.\n\n\"A heist and plundering of gold\" - that's how the judges have described the case of the missing gold.\n\nWhat was highly unusual was that Mr Potty was allowed to take out the idols since repair work is generally done within the temple, the court noted. It added that \"while handing over the precious items to him\", the temple board had recorded gold-cladded items as \"copper plates\".\n\nThe judges have also been scathing in their criticism of the temple board for \"wrongfully permitting \" Mr Potty \"to retain approximately 474.9g of gold\" after the repairs.\n\nReferring to an email Mr Potty sent to the board seeking permission to use this \"surplus gold\" for the \"marriage of a girl known or related to him\", the court said it was \"deeply disturbing and exposes, yet again, the extent of the impropriety involved\".\n\nMr Potty has been arrested and sent to judicial custody by a magistrate and the BBC has not been able to speak to him\n\nBut on his way out from the court after his arrest, he shouted at the throng of waiting reporters that he was being \"trapped\".\n\n\"The truth will come out. Those who trapped me in this will face the law. Everything will be revealed,\" he said.\n\nIn the past few days, police have also arrested two board officials. The board's president PS Prasanth, who is also under investigation, did not respond to calls or messages from the BBC.\n\nEarlier, he told reporters that \"the current board had nothing to do with the issue\" but added that he was \"fully cooperating with the investigation\" and \"hoped that all culprits would be brought to justice\".\n\nThe SIT has been given six weeks to complete its investigation and the court has vowed \"to identify and bring to book every person culpable in the matter… irrespective of the position, influence or status of the person\".\n\nThe scandal has also led to a political row in the state with opposition parties holding protests against Kerala's Communist government.\n\n\"About 5kg of gold has been stolen,\" Congress party's VD Satheesan, who is the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly, told the BBC. \"The court has expressed shock and observed that the officials are equally, if not more, culpable in the matter.\"\n\nSatheesan and other opposition politicians have demanded that the state's Minister for Temple Affairs VN Vasavan take responsibility for the failure to protect the god's valuables and resign.\n\nVasavan has denied the allegations and rejected the opposition's call for his resignation. \"We'll be fully cooperating with the court-monitored investigation by the high-level police team,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"Let the people be aware of all the transactions since 1998 and what's happening now. We have nothing to hide.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkwrv3279o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"01:24:28.819+00:00","title":"Freed in Trump deal: Prisoners in exile tell of brutality behind bars in Belarus","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In September 2025, 52 political prisoners from Belarus, including Larysa Shchyrakova and Mikalai Dziadok, were released as part of a diplomatic deal between Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko and US President Donald Trump.

They were released in September as part of a deal to relax sanctions hatched between Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko and US President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the three years she spent behind bars for \"extremism\" and \"discrediting\" Belarus, Larysa Shchyrakova missed her mother's funeral. Now she cannot visit her grave.\n\nShe left behind her son, her home, her dog and all her possessions. Like most of the freed prisoners, Larysa has no documents, and risks arrest if she returns.\n\n\"You lose everything overnight. It's a traumatic thought that at 52, you're essentially homeless,\" she told the BBC.\n\nIn reality she had no choice.\n\nVeteran opposition politician Mikola Statkevich got off Larysa's bus and refused to cross the border. He has not been heard of since, and it is assumed he was sent straight back to jail.\n\nMikalai Dziadok, a 37-year-old activist, spent five years behind bars and was marked with a special yellow tag, which meant tighter control and harsher treatment.\n\nYellow rather than white tags originally highlighted prisoners at risk of suicide or escape, so guards could keep a closer look at them.\n\nBut for Mikalai and others it was used for political prisoners deemed \"prone to extremism\". Thousands were sent to jail in the weeks and months after Lukashenko brutally suppressed mass protests in 2020.\n\nDziadok recalls how for months he was placed in solitary confinement with prisoners in cells on both sides shouting \"insults and threats to rape, kill, and dismember\" him.\n\n\"They banged their bowls against the wall for hours, day and night. They wouldn't let me sleep; it was impossible to read, write, or even think,\" he told the BBC.\n\nDziadok is sure the prisoners were acting on orders from the guards.\n\n\"[The authorities] understood probably the overwhelming majority of us would sooner or later be released,\" he said. \"And if they had to release that person, it was necessary to traumatise him as much as possible so that he could not take part in political activity in the future.\"\n\nSolitary confinement is routinely used in Belarus as punishment against political prisoners for petty \"violations\", such as not greeting the guards loudly enough. It is  a way authorities put psychological pressure on inmates, say human rights groups.\n\nAnother political prisoner released in September, Dzmitry Kuchuk, said when he was in a solitary cell, the guards would torment him by falsely saying his mother had died or that he would soon be released.\n\nThe BBC has approached the Belarusian interior ministry for comment on these allegations but has not received a reply.\n\nThe solitary cells were tiny and freezing, said Yevgeny Merkis, a colleague arrested before Larysa Shchyrakova and who was released with her in September.\n\n\"The floor is tiled, the walls are cold, and in the winter, if the temperature is above -5C, they will open the window during the day,\" Merkis told the BBC.\n\n\"You have a special uniform, and you can't wear anything underneath it, no sweater, everything is taken away. At night, they unfold a bunk for you. It's just a wooden board with metal edges.\"\n\nMikalai Dziadok said he learnt how to exercise at night, half-asleep, to warm up. \"My personal best is 300 push-ups and the same number of sit-ups in one night,\" he said.\n\nLarysa Shchyrakova was never placed in solitary confinement and could even take walks in the prison yard.\n\nHer former colleague Yevgeny had heard her singing from his cell and managed to smuggle a message to her anonymously, scratched on the bottom of her bowl.\n\n\"I'm sitting there, eating my porridge, and then I see the word  trymaysya ,\" she said.\n\nIt means \"hold on\" in Belarusian.\n\nShe had seen scribblings from prisoners before - on library books or a bench in the exercise yard. But this was in Belarusian, and immediately she felt it must have been written by a political prisoner, as they make a point of not using Russian.\n\nWhen she had finished eating, she realised her name was scrawled on the bowl too: \"Shchyrakova, hold on.\"\n\nIt was clearly from someone she knew, although she had no idea it was her friend Yevgeny Merkis who had scrawled the message on the off chance she might see it.\n\n\"It inspired me so much. There was something almost mystical about it,\" she said.\n\nTwo years later they were among the 52 political prisoners freed in September, amid a wave of pardons following negotiations between long-time Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko and Donald Trump.\n\nIn June, opposition politician Sergei Tikhanovsky - husband of presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - was freed. In July, another 16 were released.\n\nTrump later referred to Lukashenko as \"the highly respected president\" - a diplomatic boost for a leader whose self-declared victory over Tikhanovskaya in 2020 elections has been rejected as \"fraudulent\" by the US, EU, UK and Canada.\n\nIn exchange for the September prisoner release, Washington has lifted sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, so that banks can unfreeze its financial assets.\n\nBut there is no move towards a wider political \"thaw\" in Belarus.\n\n\"In Belarus, everything goes in circles,\" says Mikalai Dziadok. \"After every wave of protest, round up as many political prisoners as possible, and then, little by little, trade them for a thaw in relations with the West.\"\n\nAccording to human rights centre Viasna, around 1,220 political prisoners remain behind bars.\n\nThe charges can range from insulting the president or taking part in an extremist organisation, to calling for actions that threaten Belarus's national security.\n\nLarysa Shchyrakova is now adjusting to her new life in Lithuania and everything she has, whether food or clothes, has been funded by the expat Belarusian community.\n\nBut at least now, more than a month after her release, she has finally been reunited with her 19-year old son."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm274lmg7m1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:52:17.479+00:00","title":"Portugal: Narco-sub carrying 1.7 tonnes of cocaine seized in Atlantic","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Portuguese authorities intercepted a narco-sub carrying over 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in the mid-Atlantic, approximately 1,000 nautical miles off Lisbon.

2025-11-05T04:22:02.632+00:00\n\nTitle: California redistricting: Prop 50 passes to give Democrats advantage\n\nVoters in California have approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats - launching a counterattack against similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives\n\nCBS projects that the redistricting measure, called Prop 50, passed.\n\nIt is aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five House seats from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.\n\nWhether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear as more Republican-led states are also redrawing their voting lines under pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, Republicans hold a small, five-seat majority in the 435-member House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nIf Democrats win a majority in the chamber in the 2026 election, they will be able to stunt Donald Trump's legislative agenda for at least the next two years and also lead congressional oversight of his administration - action that could range from investigations, complete with subpoenas, to impeachment.\n\nA look nationally shows the effort in Democrat-heavy California won't be enough on its own to cancel out gains by Republicans who have also redone voting maps. Four Republican-led states have already redrawn their lines so far this year, giving the party a likely advantage in nine new voting districts.\n\nStill, experts told the BBC that those changes to districts might not be enough for Republicans keep control of the House next November.\n\nThey are called midterm elections, where voters cast ballots for congressional candidates as well as state ones, because they take place in the middle of a president's four-year term. Historically, a president often loses power of at least one chamber in Congress in the midterms.\n\nThe Brookings Institution has found that the party of the president lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections - going back to 1938.\n\n\"There are a lot of unknowns still and a lot can happen before the midterms politically, but looking at it historically - this is an uphill battle for Republicans,\" said Galen Sheely, research director for the State Voting Laws Roundup project, a collaboration between the Brennan Center for Justice and the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRedistricting typically is done once every 10 years, to reflect population changes recorded by the US Census.\n\nRedrawing voting lines in the middle of the decade to try to engineer election gains is \"a new strategy that is pushing boundaries that haven't been pushed before\", Dr Sheely added.\n\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle started with Trump pressuring conservative-led states to redraw their congressional districts to help Republicans retain control of the House. Now, more than a dozen US states are openly mulling plans to redraw voting lines - known as political gerrymandering.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it's Democrats or Republicans, this is just not good for our republic in the long term,\" said Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University. \"The question now is where does this stop? It's political sabotage to our democracy.\"\n\nFrom his viewpoint, the battle runs the risk of both eroding trust in the government, with people seeing their votes and representation in Washington diminished, along with erasing battleground districts where members of both parties have equal shots at winning the seat.\n\nRepresentatives from those districts often are crucial to negotiating deals and finding middle ground - things that have become harder in Congress amid a bitter political divide, he said.\n\n\"It's hard to not mention the ongoing government shutdown in this,\" he added. \"This will worsen polarisation and gridlock in Congress. And the ripple effect of that will mean emboldening this president and future presidents to act unilaterally without Congress.\"\n\nTrump, who began his redistricting push with Texas, has argued that he and Republicans are entitled to more congressional seats due to him winning those states in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nTexas responded to Trump's call by redoing its maps to give Republicans an advantage in five new seats. And in turn, California Democrats introduced Prop, short for \"Proposition\", 50.\n\nCalifornia's governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe with reported presidential ambitions, championed Prop 50. He is now pushing Democrats to follow his lead and fight fire with fire - something he argues the party hasn't been willing to do in the past.\n\n\"These folks don't play by the rules,\" he has said of Republicans. \"If they can't win playing the game with the existing set of rules, they'll change the rules. That's what Donald Trump has done.\"\n\nHigh-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Kamala Harris helped fundraise and generate support for the measure across the country.\n\nCampaigns in support of the measure and against it received $200m total, but Democrats far outraised Republicans, with Newsom telling donors last week that they could stop sending in money.\n\nIf other states do not join in, though, the proposition and its momentum may not lead to a significant change in the House.\n\nWhile it could help score five seats for Democrats, more and more Republican-led states are also changing their maps.\n\nNorth Carolina, Missouri and Ohio have all passed new maps that give Republicans a new edge. Utah has also passed a new map, which would give Democrats an advantage in one district, but it is under legal review.\n\nEach state decides its voting districts differently and many Republican-led states have had an easier time changing their maps, due to their state laws, election deadlines, current districts or political leadership.\n\nTexas, for instance, created its new districts through the state legislature.\n\nCalifornia, though, needed voter support to change its political maps.\n\nUnder a state law intended to halt political gerrymandering, an independent commission usually sets California's voting districts once a decade. To deviate from that, the state had to call a special election, where Prop 50 was the only thing on the ballot, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $200m. The new Prop 50 maps will only be in use until 2030 when the commission will again redraw the districts.\n\nAs leaders in both liberal and conservative-leaning states look into redistricting, another factor is looming on the horizon, threatening to make an impact on the 2026 midterms: The  Supreme Court is currently reviewing a case  that - depending on the ruling - could drastically reshape how districts are drawn."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2kyjrg77eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:02:08.186+00:00","title":"What a UK government led by Reform would really look like","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Reform UK has won control of 10 English local authorities, including six county councils, and is now undergoing a critical evaluation of its governance performance over the past six months.

more seats than any other party at the next general election - perhaps enough to form a government. Or so suggest repeated opinion polls, released since May. That was also when Reform won control of 10 English local authorities - so what does their first six months at the helm at local level show about what a UK government led by them could look like?\n\nListen to Alex reading this article\n\nLast month a leaked video recording showed Linden Kemkaran, Reform UK's leader in Kent, swearing at councillors from her own party and telling them to \"suck it up\" if they didn't agree with her.\n\nThe footage became national news - insights into tensions within local government are, after all, rarely made public, and Kent is Reform UK's self-professed flagship council.\n\nPlenty of critics seized on the incident.\n\nLabour MPs in Kent labelled her \"unprofessional\" and \"not up to the job,\" and local Liberal Democrat and Green groups claimed Reform's running of the council had descended into chaos.\n\nFive of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party amid the upheaval. Kemkaran, meanwhile, remains firmly in post.\n\nAnd she has declared that it is \"business as usual\" at Kent County Council.\n\nTo some the fallout was undoubtedly damaging and has prompted questions about whether this insurgent party, that is consistently topping national opinion polls, really is a credible force ready to run the country - something they are trying to prove.\n\nDanny Kruger, who is one of Reform's five MPs, has his own take. Last month he described the party as a bit of a pirate ship with an \"ill-disciplined\" crew and a \"buccaneering\" captain, but added: \"A powerful ship with a dangerous broadside, a terror to its rivals…\n\n\"The job… is to help turn this pirate ship into His Majesty's Royal Navy ship, ready to enter the King's service and serve our nation.\"\n\nSo what can we glean from Reform's performance at local level about how they lead - and how well they have so far fared on delivering their promises?\n\nThese are, after all, promises that are not dissimilar in nature to those they would need to keep if they were successful in their bid to reach Number 10.\n\nIt has been exactly six months since the local elections saw Reform take outright control of 10 English local authorities, including six of 21 county councils.\n\nIn all it won 677 seats - more than any other party, amounting to 41% of the total up for election.\n\nBefore the elections, Nigel Farage addressed a packed rally in Birmingham promising his party would \"send in the auditors… get rid of the fraudulent contracts… cut spending\" if it won.\n\nShortly after their success in the local elections, Reform launched a \"DOGE\" unit, based on billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to cut spending in the US with a Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nA photo call on the steps of Kent County Council followed, with a promise that a team of soft ware engineers, data analysts and forensic auditors would \"visit and analyse\" local authorities to identify \"wasteful spending\".\n\nBut the unit has run into legal challenges in accessing sensitive council data. So far it is reported to have visited only a handful of the councils in England that Reform controls.\n\nZia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy who led the DOGE team until last month, acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming \"overwhelming demands\" from Whitehall. Nonetheless he insists that hundreds of millions of pounds in savings have already been identified.\n\n\"The reality is there's a lot of information that can be shared… because it's in the public domain already,\" he says. \"[DOGE] has been working with every single one of our councils on an ongoing basis.\"\n\nHe points to certain decisions by Kent County Council, including halting a planned office move and stopping net-zero schemes, as examples of the savings he says Reform has found.\n\nCouncils spend the bulk of their budgets on statutory services that they have to provide by law, and the cost of these services has spiralled in recent years.\n\nThe County Councils' Network, which represents some of England's largest local authorities, says its members spend on average 69% of their budgets on adult social care and children's services, with some spending up to 76% - an increase from 63% a decade ago.\n\nReform's argument is that there's still \"waste\" to be found, with Yusuf saying: \"This idea that… because social care is statutory there's no point in finding those savings - we don't buy that.\"\n\nBut Stuart Hoddinott, an associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, believes that the savings Reform have identified so far are \"minuscule\" in comparison to the financial challenge facing the sector.\n\n\"They've found things that are just so tiny to be completely insignificant or are cutting programmes that might actually end up saving money in the longer run.\n\n\"It has just been a complete sort of mirage so far... It's like somebody who makes £30,000 worrying about losing 2p per year.\"\n\nThe pressure on council budgets across the country has been well-documented. Ahead of this year's spending review, the Local Government Association estimated councils would face a funding gap of £8.4bn by 2028/29.\n\nThe controversial Kent council meeting, in which tensions boiled over, was a private discussion that seemed to focus, among other things, on both budgets and local government reorganisation.\n\nIt is another illustration of how, when it comes to setting a budget, Reform is now facing many of the same challenges as parties that preceded it.\n\nStuart Hoddinott acknowledges that Reform has entered a \"broken\" system, given the pressure on funding for statutory services and cuts already made across the board - but he accuses the party of \"bluster\" and \"outlandish promises\".\n\n\"They have focused on culture wars, things like 'Oh we'll just cut DEI (diversity equity and inclusion) programmes from local authorities and won't run a Pride flag up the pole every June, then that will solve our financial problems,'\" he argues.\n\n\"They were also very naive to think that they would be the ones to solve it [budget pressures] given that you have had 15 years of 300-odd local authorities all battling this and trying to come up with solutions.\"\n\nReform's DOGE unit has now had a change of personnel.\n\nRichard Tice, the party's deputy leader, has taken over, a change he says was simply a \"natural evolution\" from Yusuf.\n\nHe has said billions can be saved, and that his focus will be on local government pension schemes, property and \"waste-related contracts\". The party, he adds, will also make announcements on support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, which is a cost pressure for councils.\n\n\"You'll be hearing over the next few weeks in areas where we have achieved savings, we have identified savings – and where we need to have some serious discussions about what actually is sensible in certain areas,\" he has said.\n\nBut these are thorny issues that will likely prove controversial.\n\nTony Travers, a professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, argues that any benefits would likely take time to filter through.\n\n\"Reforming the pension system… might produce benefits for local government in the medium term, but it's probably not going to do it for next May, next April,\" he says.\n\n\"That's the trouble. With a lot of these things, they can't be done quickly or as quickly as Reform needs.\"\n\nHe believes that Reform's cost-cutting narrative was, ultimately, \"never realistic\" - and in his view the party is now facing the \"dawning reality\" of an \"extraordinary period of financial constraint\" that other councils have faced before them.\n\nNow, as councils begin the process of setting budgets for next year, the picture looks bleak for many - including those led by Reform.\n\nLancashire is facing a budget gap of £100m over the next two years; in West Northamptonshire the council has warned of \"tough choices\" as it tries to plug a £50m gap; while Worcestershire has asked residents for their views on a potential council tax rise of 10%, combined with millions of pounds of cuts.\n\nAnd Warwickshire council - led by George Finch, who was just 19 years old when he took office this summer - warned of \"difficult decisions to come\".\n\nEven though the government has increased the amount of funding available to councils this year and is introducing a new method of allocating funding from next year, claiming it is \"fixing a broken system\", this all still poses a challenge for Reform UK, if it is to fully meet its promises to cut costs and save money.\n\nEarly indications are that Reform-led councils will raise council tax from April 2026 – something acknowledged by both Richard Tice and Zia Yusuf - though both say the focus is on keeping increases low.\n\n\"We never said we would cut council tax,\" Tice says. \"But if you can identify the savings, identify what you shouldn't be doing… then we can achieve lower increases than anybody else.\"\n\nYusuf suggested the rises were unlikely to exceed inflation levels.\n\n\"I would expect certainly [in] most of our councils [for] council tax not to go up by more - it is their decision, but it will be a rise in line with inflation, as opposed to the council going into bankruptcy or a rise much more than 5%,\" he says.\n\n(His comments came before Reform-led Worcestershire signalled the possibility of a 10% rise.)\n\nBut keeping council tax relatively low sometimes entails spending cuts – which might not prove popular.\n\nAnd the question now is whether Reform really can prove to be better custodians of public money than their predecessors – and avoid the effective bankruptcy that has hit some other local authorities, while providing value for money.\n\nAt the start of the year, Reform UK, Labour and the Conservatives were all averaging about 25% in opinion polls registering voting intention.\n\nBut in May that all changed: for more than five months Reform's average poll result has hovered around 30%, while the two other parties have now fallen below 20%.\n\nProf Travers believes the party would likely encounter challenges similar to those it is currently facing in councils were it to win the keys to Number 10.\n\nIt has previously promised tax cuts, and an overhaul of government spending to increase efficiency, echoing its programme for local government.\n\nAlready there are signs they are realising what is realistic, and what is not.\n\nEarlier this week Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year.\n\n\"Substantial tax cuts\" are not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances, he said, proposing instead \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and scrapping inheritance tax for family-run businesses.\n\n\"The truth is, the constraints of real government would be just as real if they got in at Westminster,\" Prof Travers says.\n\n\"Could you really cut benefits for millions of people? It's not that easy… So all of this is the kind of local version of the fact that even political parties who attempt to cut or reduce NHS spending, find themselves increasing it. It's just a local version of that.\"\n\nBen Ramanauskas, a senior research fellow in economics at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that Reform's instinct to look to cut back waste is right – despite the challenges.\n\n\"Definitely, any party should be looking for efficiency savings,\" he says. \"This is taxpayers' money being spent and the priority has to be essential public services. There are examples of where there is some waste going on.\n\n\"But it is a very tough job for local authorities and councillors,\" he adds. \"And I think any party in that position would possibly struggle, given just how our system operates.\"\n\nHe argues it will be easier to \"scale up\" savings at a national level, with the ability to pull all the levers of power.\n\nLooking ahead to the next general election, it would be logical to assume that the fate of Reform - and whether or not it will win enough support to make the leap to Downing Street - rests in part on how it fares at the helm of the councils with these gnarly financial challenges.\n\nAfter all, Reform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises - so what are the consequences if they cannot deliver on their own pledges in local government?\n\nLuke Tryl, director of focus group and polling company More in Common, argues that this link is not necessarily as direct as it may seem.\n\n\"If you look at the reasons people went and voted for Reform in the local elections, they were number one – overwhelmingly - migration, and Channel crossings in particular. And number two, general disillusionment with the main parties.\n\n\"I'm just not sure that Reform's failure to find savings necessarily helps with that.\"\n\nInstead, he believes that one of the main risks for Reform that could cost it supporters would be a significant failing in one of the councils – such as a crisis in social care, or bins, or bankruptcy.\n\n\"I don't say that the message of 'Reform has put your council tax up' is going to be deterring people in the general election,\" he added.\n\nAs to whether Reform is ready, based on the evidence so far from their leadership of England's councils, in the six months since May, the jury is out.\n\n\"It's very difficult to say exactly that Reform councillors are more or less chaotic than other councillors,\" says Stuart Hoddinott.\n\n\"They get more attention. So these stories tend to blow a bit more.

These ghost directors, such as Hadi Ahmad Ali and Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, operate more than 100 businesses across the UK, with many linked to illicit tobacco and vape sales. Asylum seekers, including Kurdish individuals like Surchi, use these networks to circumvent immigration restrictions, sell to minors, evade enforcement, and profit from low-priced illegal products. The network employs tactics such as dissolving and re-registering businesses with minor name changes to avoid detection.

But a financial crime investigator told the BBC he believes it goes much wider.\n\nReacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: \"Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it.\"\n\nFor the first time, we can reveal the inner workings of a criminal system that lets asylum seekers work in plain sight on UK High Streets, in mini-marts that mainly profit from illegal cigarettes and vapes.\n\nOne man told us weekly takings from illicit tobacco at his shop could be \"sometimes, up to £3,000\".\n\nThe men who facilitate it all - so-called \"ghost directors\" - each have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House but in many cases are not involved in running them.\n\n\"The shop doesn't belong to me, it's just under my name,\" one of them told our undercover reporters.\n\nMany of the businesses are dissolved after about a year, and then re-opened with small changes to official paperwork.\n\nThese businesses have \"all the red flags\" associated with organised criminality, a financial crime investigator told the BBC.\n\nDuring our investigation we found:\n\nThe two Kurdish journalists involved in our investigation know that tensions over immigration are high. They worry that such coverage of illegal activities within the Kurdish community could inflame hostilities.\n\nOne of them is a former asylum seeker himself, and says \"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us.\"\n\nOver four months, we monitored a Kurdish Facebook group where businesses across the UK were listed for sale.\n\nNew adverts popped up every week.\n\nThe reporters got in touch with three people who listed mini-marts for sale in Crewe, Hull and Liverpool. They said they were interested in running a mini-mart and trading illegal cigarettes.\n\nIn Cheshire, the man running a Crewe mini-mart called Top Store said he would sell his shop to one reporter for £18,000 cash.\n\nThe shopkeeper, who went by the name Surchi, assured our journalist that \"you don't need anything\" to own and run a mini-mart as an asylum seeker.\n\nSurchi told us he was himself a Kurdish asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in 2022, but whose claim had been refused.\n\nWhen the BBC later confronted him, he told us he had paperwork proving his right to work. We asked if he could show us these documents, but he hasn't provided them.\n\nAsylum seekers generally do not have the right to work in the UK while their claim is being processed. Permission to work is only granted in limited circumstances and is subject to strict conditions.\n\nIf asylum seekers are granted permission to work, they can only apply for eligible jobs on the Immigration Salary List.\n\nThese do not include being a shop manager or shop assistant.\n\nLike our undercover reporters, Surchi told us he was from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, an area that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The region is often referred to as Kurdistan, but it is not an independent country.\n\nTo avoid scrutiny by the authorities, Surchi said he paid someone called \"Hadi\" about £250 a month to be named on official papers.\n\n\"That's his job and he probably has 40 to 50 shops under his name. There's no problem, he doesn't mind what you sell,\" he explained.\n\nThis arrangement let Surchi go under the radar of immigration enforcement and sell whatever he liked. He said he had never paid any council tax and that our undercover reporter would not need to officially register the company.\n\nImmigration enforcement officers had only come by once in the past five years, when he was out, Surchi said during his sales patter. They never returned, he said.\n\nTrading Standards had raided the shop once, Surchi said, and he had been given a £200 fine for selling illegal cigarettes and vapes.\n\nShop owners in the UK caught selling these items can be fined up to £10,000, but the profits that can be made from such products far outweigh the penalties.\n\nDuring a tour of the premises, Surchi took us outside to a so-called \"stash car\" where he said he hid the bulk of his stock until 17:00 each night, when Trading Standards officers finished for the day.\n\nHe also told our reporter that \"you could make a hiding spot\" for the stock in the shop's basement - where he also showed how he tampered with the electricity meter to avoid paying utility bills.\n\nSurchi sold vapes to a group of teenagers while we were at the shop. \"I have customers that are 12 years old, I don't have any problem with them,\" he said.\n\nCustomers paid via a card machine into a bank account, he explained. Both of these belonged to his cousin, he said, who owned a mini-mart 15 miles away in Stoke.\n\nOn Facebook, we discovered Kurdish builders willing to help us conceal illegal vapes and cigarettes.\n\nOne of our reporters posted that he had bought a mini-mart in Manchester and was looking for \"a specialist to build a space to hide cigarettes in the shop\".\n\nSix builders got in touch. One sent us a video of what looked like a vending machine for illegal cigarettes hidden in a loft, which, at the press of a button, pinged packets down a chute to a concealed vent below.\n\nIt was \"fine craftsmanship\" and cost £6,000, the builder said, claiming it was guaranteed to fool Trading Standards' sniffer dogs.\n\nAs we delved deeper into who officially owned these mini-marts, a network of ghost directors began to emerge.\n\nOne name that kept coming up was Hadi Ahmad Ali - the Birmingham man to whom Surchi told us he was paying his monthly fee. We found Mr Ahmad Ali listed on Companies House as being from Iraq, in his 40s and a director of more than 50 other businesses - mini-marts, barbers and car washes.\n\nOne of our reporters phoned him pretending to be an asylum seeker looking to buy the Crewe business to sell illegal cigarettes. Mr Ahmad Ali said the shop didn't belong to him but the lease was under his name. He confirmed he could keep it in his name for our undercover reporter, for a fee of between £250 and £300 a month.\n\nHe also said he could try to provide a bank card for the shop.\n\n\"I will give you a 50% guarantee that I can get you a bank card. I have another six to seven shops under my name in Hull and other places.\"\n\nMr Ahmad Ali is still listed as an active director on several businesses on Companies House. We later learned that in October 2024 he had been disqualified from being a company officer for five years.\n\nThe ban followed illegal cigarette sales at a shop in his name in Chorley, Lancashire - including to a 16-year-old.\n\nSeparately, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in the sale of illegal cigarettes in Lincolnshire and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.\n\nWhen later confronted by the BBC, Mr Ahmad Ali told us these mini-marts were nothing to do with him, and he had contacted Companies House to get his name removed from the businesses.\n\nA spokesperson for Companies House said it \"now has greater powers to share information and support law enforcement investigations\".\n\n\"Where criminality is suspected, information and intelligence are shared with relevant partners.\"\n\nOur research linked Mr Ahmad Ali to another man, Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, who we found was a ghost director and responsible for 25 mini-marts.\n\nMr Farzanda's name came up because Companies House filings showed he had taken over as company director from Mr Ahmad Ali at seven mini-mart businesses. The pair also shared a co-directorship on one shop in Blackpool.\n\nOne of our reporters managed to call Mr Farzanda, using the same cover story as he had told Mr Ahmad Ali.\n\n\"I just put the shops under my name for people,\" said Mr Farzanda who, like Mr Ahmad Ali, was based in the West Midlands. He told us an \"accountant\" would take care of the paperwork, bank accounts and payments to him, and that he would have no problem with us selling illegal cigarettes.\n\nThe only request he had was that if the undercover reporter was ever caught by the police, he should let him know immediately.\n\n\"If you know you're caught, tell us so that for the interviews we can change the name and not get in trouble,\" he told our reporter.\n\nMr Farzanda was fined £4,500 in August after one shop, registered in his name in Haslingden, Lancashire, was caught selling illegal vapes to a 14-year-old, according to local media reports.\n\nSeventeen shops registered under the names of Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda have been raided since 2021 with illegal tobacco and vapes seized, Trading Standards sources confirmed.\n\nDespite being registered on official documents as being from Iran, Mr Farzanda told our undercover reporter he was actually from the Sharazoor district in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nBoth our undercover reporters say they are aware of Kurdish people who have arrived in the UK on small boats and pretended to be Iranian, believing their asylum claims would have a better chance of success.\n\nWhen later presented with our evidence, Mr Farzanda denied all the allegations put to him by the BBC.\n\nWhen we looked into the official records attached to all the companies listed for Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda, a suspicious pattern emerged.\n\nWe found companies would be set up for a year, dissolved, and then set up again - each time with a slightly different spelling of the businesses' names. The men's names and birthdays would also be changed slightly.\n\n\"Why are they doing that? It's most likely to evade tax and to dodge scrutiny by authorities,\" said financial crime investigator Graham Barrow, when we showed him our data.\n\nWe have also confirmed details of two further ghost directors - with 40 companies listed between them.\n\nThis UK-wide network of more than 100 company directorships in the names of just four individuals has \"all the red flags that I would associate with organised criminal networks\", said Mr Barrow.\n\nThe network of businesses identified by the BBC could stretch even wider across the country, said Mr Barrow: \"I certainly think it's hundreds. It could easily be bigger than that,\" he said.\n\nWe visited more than a dozen mini-marts linked to this network of ghost directors.\n\nEverywhere we went, it was the same story - the shops were on rundown High Streets in some of the UK's most deprived areas, such as Blackpool, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull.\n\nAll but one of the shops sold counterfeit or smuggled cigarettes for about £4 per pack, instead of the average UK price of £16 for a pack of 20.\n\nAs well as Surchi's story in Crewe, our investigation revealed details of other Kurdish asylum seekers being employed illegally.\n\nA mini-mart worker in a Blackpool shop linked to one of the ghost directors told us he had left an asylum-seeker hotel in Liverpool to work 14-hour days at the shop. \"In return I get £60 to £65 [per day],\" he told us. \"For three months, I worked for £50 [per day].\"\n\nHe was interviewed by the Home Office four months ago, he said, but hasn't heard anything since. The shop had been raided by Trading Standards three times, he told us - but he described that as \"nothing\".\n\n\"Just give them any name and they will walk away,\" he explained, saying that whenever he was asked who he was, he would give the name of a famous Kurdish singer, Aziz Waisi.\n\nHe did say he was worried by immigration enforcement, however. \"They [Trading Standards] take the cigarettes and leave, but immigration makes you do fingerprints.\"\n\nWe also found another Kurdish shopworker in a Salford shop registered under Ismaeel Farzanda's name, who said he was in limbo. \"I've been here for six months and I still haven't claimed asylum,\" he said.\n\nThe 42-year-old said he had first come to the UK as a teenager, before returning to Kurdistan.\n\nHe said he returned to the UK this year and \"they found my previous fingerprint records but nothing came of it\". He said he was staying with friends.\n\n\"Honestly, we're all struggling here and don't know what to do.\"\n\nThe government says it has increased raids by 51% and this year raised the fines for businesses to £60,000 per person found working illegally.\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood added that the government has \"seized millions of pounds worth of unlicensed goods, banned dodgy directors and removed more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Phill Edwards and Kirstie Brewer"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr038ze97yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:48:39.581+00:00","title":"Trailblazer Patti Smith on influencing artists like Taylor Swift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Patti Smith, a pioneering singer-songwriter and poet, is celebrated for her profound influence on generations of artists, including Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa, whose work reflects her poetic and rebellious spirit.

like Taylor Swift\n\nDua Lipa admires her writing. Taylor Swift referenced her in her track The Tortured Poets Department, singing: \"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith\".\n\nFifty years after Smith released her swaggering, era-defining album Horses, she is back on the road and also publishing a new memoir, titled Bread of Angels.\n\n\"The idea of the book came to me in a dream,\" Smith tells me.\n\nIt's a fantastic read - a portrait of an artist who was at the heart of New York's counter-cultural scene in the 1970s. Smith was rubbing shoulders with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and poet William Burroughs.\n\nDuring that heady period, she was performing at the legendary CBGBs (although the club \"wasn't legendary yet… it was completely unknown\", she tells me).\n\nThe singer-songwriter was also refusing to compromise to the whims of male record producers. \"I had a lot of armour and it wasn't easily pierced,\" she says.\n\nHer first album Horses was for the disenfranchised and the shunned.\n\n\"We were still living in a time where if a kid told their parents they were gay in the Midwest or somewhere, they were disowned. New York was filled with the disowned.”\n\nWhen we met, Smith had just played the Palladium on the London leg of her European tour.\n\nDelivering songs that are at least half a century old to an audience of all ages, including young people who know her lyrics, \"could bring you to tears, it's very humbling,\" she tells me. \"It makes me feel like I'm still doing something useful - and that's a great feeling.”\n\nBeing useful is clearly a driver for Smith - a poet, writer, artist, activist and trailblazer whose anthemic rock song People Have the Power is a call to stand up for what you believe in.\n\nShe wrote the track with her husband, musician Fred 'Sonic' Smith, who died more than 30 years ago, aged just 44.\n\nThe song was \"his concept”, she tells me, \"and it was for the people of the future, for marches, for protest, for just feeling some strength\".\n\nShe's since \"been on marches where people didn't know I was marching - and they were singing that song spontaneously\".\n\nIt is \"heartbreaking\" that Fred didn't live to see it. But it also makes her \"so proud for him and happy\".\n\nWhen I ask if the new book is a love letter to him, she's visibly moved. Even 30 years on, it appears talking about Fred can bring her to tears. She takes a moment to compose herself, while sharing \"it's not a sad feeling\".\n\nProbably her best-known hit was also Fred-related. Bruce Springsteen's recording engineer had offered her a song that the singer had abandoned, to see if she could come up with an idea for the lyrics. She avoided listening until one night, when she was waiting for her weekly call from Fred, who was living in Detroit.\n\nShe played the tape and tells me she said to herself: \"'It's one of those darn hits'. I knew it, as soon as I listened to it. It was in my key, it was perfect, it had sensualness, it was anthemic.\"\n\nShe wrote the lyrics to Because the Night as she waited for Fred to call, including the lines “Have I doubt when I'm alone? Love is a ring, the telephone”. (He did eventually call.)\n\nSmith ditched her music career when she was at the very top, touring Europe and being chased down the street by fans, because she fell in love with Fred. She gave up the band to return to her first love - poetry - and wedded bliss (the couple had two children together).\n\nThe book \"is a love letter to my parents, to my siblings, to my husband, to my brother, to all of the people named and unnamed that helped shape me\".\n\nShe's certainly lost more than her fair share of loved ones far too young.\n\nNot just Fred, but her best friend, the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, who was felled by Aids in 1989 at the age of 42. (Smith's 2010 book Just Kids, charts their relationship and was described by Dua Lipa as \"an incredible book and such a time capsule of creativity when it was really emerging, especially during that time in the 1960s and 1970s\".)\n\nPatti's adored brother Todd also died, at the age of 45.\n\nIn Bread of Angels, Smith writes with her usual vividness about her upbringing. Her family relocated 11 times before she was four years old. They were evicted and had to live with relatives; they moved into a rat-infested tenement building in Philadelphia.\n\nBut what radiates most from the book is how she developed her artistic passions from a really young age.\n\nWhile most of us were still honing our fine motor skills playing with Lego bricks, the young Smith seemed to be asking big philosophical questions about life and becoming fascinated by words.\n\nPoetry, she writes, \"formed a map that led to the kingdom of the infinite imagination\".\n\nShe was obsessed with French poet Arthur Rimbaud, and aged 17, it was a \"seamless transition\" to Bob Dylan.\n\n\"Both poets' words seemed as if they were written for the tribe of black sheep, outsiders trying to exist in the times they were dealt,\" she says.\n\nAs any of the 1.4 million people who follow her on Instagram know, she's an artist to her core.\n\nThe book delves deeper into what shaped her.\n\nSmith described to me discovering some Vogue magazines as a child and becoming enchanted by contemporary photography.\n\nShe was \"shocked, stunned, beguiled. It was a whole new world… I can't say why a little seven-year old kid was drawn to that, living in a lower middle class area after World War II, but it was a real thing\".\n\nAge nine, struck down with a virus during the Asian flu pandemic, and so ill the doctor says she probably won't survive, her mother bought her a boxset recording of Puccini's Madame Butterfly and put it within eyeshot of her bed.\n\nSmith genuinely believes that the desire to listen to it made her get well.\n\nAnd on the family's only visit to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, young Patti slipped off alone to a hall of Picassos and was \"smitten\". She had \"fallen for art\".\n\nIt was her beloved father who took her to that museum. Smith was a sickly child, contracting bronchial pneumonia, tuberculosis, German measles, mumps and chicken pox which kept her in \"periods of lengthy bed rest\".\n\nHer mother told her her dad actually saved her life as a baby. She was \"born coughing\". He would hold little Patti above a steaming washtub to help her breathe.\n\nHer love for him is evident. But after he and her mother died, she and her sister did a DNA test to find out more about their heritage. Smith made the \"shocking\" discovery that her biological father was someone different. She reveals it for the first time in her memoir.\n\n\"I would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit broken-hearted.\n\n\"It actually held the book up for a while because I had to process that. So much of my book is dedicated to my father and it still is.\n\n\"He will always be my father, but now I have two fathers.”\n\nShe discovered her blood father was Jewish, \"100% Ashkenazi”, with relatives who she says were driven out of Russia to Ukraine, then on to Liverpool, England, and Newfoundland, Canada, before taking root in Philadelphia in the US.\n\n\"I don't know a whole lot about him,\" she tells me. \"But everything I found out about him, I recognise. I recognise myself in his face. I've only seen a couple of pictures, but the same attitude. I can just feel it.”\n\nThe discovery has given her answers about the \"things about yourself that the rest of your family doesn't have\".\n\nSmith praises her mother for keeping the secret from her. \"This is how great my mother was. My mother knew in her lifetime that I favoured my father, so she never said a word to make me feel that he wasn't… she did her best to protect me.”\n\nPatti Smith has always struck me as uncompromising. Think of those fabulous, almost gender-defying photographs from the 1970s.\n\nShe was the height of countercultural cool.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect when we met. I found a warm and thoughtful person, with an intense aesthetic sensibility and a - just as intense - love of family. Her losses have shaped her.\n\nHer poetic artistry has shaped us all.\n\nShe's also an ardent supporter of the younger female artists who have followed in her footsteps. Dua Lipa. Taylor Swift. They're \"doing a good job”, she tells me, because the music industry is \"dominated by women\".\n\nShe calls them \"strong girls… like the song The Kids are All Right, the girls are all right. They're facing a lot of stuff, but they're facing it well\".\n\nBread of Angels by Patti Smith is published on 4 November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzm1j6l76o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:18:43.998+00:00","title":"Dick Cheney's death a loss to the nation, says George W Bush","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Vice President and a key architect of the 'war on terror', died at 84 from complications of pneumonia and heart disease.

He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people.\"\n\nCondoleezza Rice, who served as Secretary of State alongside Cheney in the Bush administration, said she admired him \"for his integrity and his love of our country\".\n\n\"He was an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service,\" she wrote on X.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said: \"Though we often disagreed, I always respected his dedication to our country and his unwavering sense of duty.\"\n\nDespite being a stalwart figure in the Republican party for many years, Cheney became a bitter critic of it under the leadership of Donald Trump.\n\nThe president has yet to comment on his death, but the White House says Trump is \"aware\" of it.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said: \"Scripture is very clear, we give honour where honour is due.\"\n\n\"Even when we had political differences as somebody later in life, you have to honour the sacrifices and the service they gave to their country,\" he said.\n\nFlags at the White House were lowered to half-staff on Tuesday morning, shortly after his death was announced.\n\nIn their statement announcing his death, Cheney's family said that he was a \"great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honour, love, kindness, and fly fishing\".\n\nCheney was a controversial political figure, particularly in his role behind the \"war on terror\", which saw the US invade Iraq in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIraqi writer Sinan Antoon said that Cheney's lasting legacy in the country is of \"chaos and terrorism\".\n\n\"In a different world Dick Cheney would definitely be a war criminal and would be standing trial,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.\n\nKristofer Goldsmith, a US Army veteran who was deployed to Iraq, also told the BBC that \"most people recognise Dick Cheney as someone who created a massive problem that ended up in hundreds of thousands of deaths.\"\n\nRichard \"Dick\" Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1941 and later attended the prestigious Yale University on a scholarship but failed to graduate.\n\nHe went on to gain a Master's degree in political science from the University of Wyoming.\n\nHis first taste of Washington came in 1968, when he worked for William Steiger, a young Republican representative from Wisconsin.\n\nCheney became chief of staff under Gerald Ford in 1975, when he was just 34 years old, before spending a decade in the House of Representatives.\n\nAs secretary of defence under George Bush Snr, he presided over the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Gulf War, in which a US-led coalition evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait.\n\nHe became VP to George W Bush in 2001, and played a greater role in making major policy decisions than most of his predecessors.\n\nIt is for this role that he will be remembered best and most controversially.\n\nDuring the younger Bush's administration, he singlehandedly turned his role as vice-president from what was traditionally an empty role, with little formal power, into a de-facto deputy presidency, overseeing American foreign policy and national security in the wake of the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001.\n\nHe was a leading advocate of US military action in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Cheney said that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons were never found during the military campaign.\n\nHe also repeatedly claimed there were links between Iraq and al-Qaeda, the terror group led by Osama bin Laden that claimed responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. He said the attackers would incur the \"full wrath\" of American military might.\n\nCheney's key role in the campaign heavily affected his political legacy, after the US took years to extricate itself from its costly war in Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nHis political career later became the subject of a major feature film in 2018's Vice - with actor Christian Bale receiving a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the former vice-president.\n\nCheney had numerous heart problems throughout his life.\n\nHe suffered the first of many heart attacks in 1978, when he was just 37. Cheney was campaigning for a seat in the House of Representatives at the time - and smoking three packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nIn 2010 he underwent surgery to install a small heart pump to try to combat \"increasing congestive heart failure\".\n\nAt this point he had already suffered five heart attacks. Two years later, Cheney had a full heart transplant.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney, and seven grandchildren.\n\nDespite decades working for Republican presidents, he became a bitter opponent of President Donald Trump.\n\nHaving initially endorsed him in 2016, Cheney was appalled by allegations of Russian interference in the presidential election and Trump's seemingly casual attitude towards Nato.\n\nHe supported his older daughter, Liz, as she became a leading Republican \"never Trump\" in the House of Representatives - and condemned the refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election.\n\nTwo months before last year's US presidential election, Cheney staged a major intervention: announcing that he would vote for the Democrats' Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump\".\n\nIn return, Trump called Cheney \"irrelevant RINO\" - an acronym which stands for \"Republican in name only\".\n\nReacting to Cheney's death, Harris said \"his passing marks the loss of a figure who, with a strong sense of dedication, gave so much of his life to the country he loved.\"\n\nIn his final years, Cheney would become a persona non grata in his own party, which had been reshaped in Trump's image.\n\nIn an odd final twist, his own Trump criticism - and endorsement of Harris - would win him praise from some on the left who had once denounced him decades earlier."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp1q8dx3xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"23:17:59.559+00:00","title":"William criticises Amazon forest deforestation crime in Brazil visit","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his official visit to Brazil, Prince William criticized illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, attributing it to criminal gangs that fuel violence and corruption.

deforestation crime in Brazil visit\n\nThe Prince of Wales has criticised criminals involved in the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, during a speech in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWilliam was speaking at the United for Wildlife conference on Tuesday as part of his royal visit to Brazil.\n\n\"In the past year alone, over 1.7 million hectares of the Amazon were cleared across this region... much of which is driven by illicit activity,\" he told the audience.\n\nEarlier, William visited the small Brazilian island of Paqueta - home to a population of just 4,000 - where he was greeted by dozens of people and given a baby to hold.\n\nAfter a first day consisting of an official welcome with football in the Maracana Stadium and barefoot beach volleyball on Copacabana, the future king's second day in Brazil - and reason for visiting - was focused on the environment.\n\nHollywood star Leonardo Di Caprio recorded a video message at the summit, urging  world leaders meeting in Brazil to \"unite with courage and ambition\".\n\nTuesday's wildlife summit organised by William - the first of its kind - highlighted the damage caused by environmental crime, and the prince announced a new fund for

crime fuels violence and corruption, distorts legitimate economies, and negatively impacts the livelihoods of millions.\"\n\nBut he ended on an optimistic note: \"We must stand alongside those who

Kylie Minogue and Shawn Mendes will perform at the event on Wednesday evening.\n\nFive projects will each win a million pound prize for their environmental innovations.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a socially conservative Republican who pledged her allegiance to Mr. Trump even though he did little to help her cash-starved campaign.\n\nThe A.P. called the race for Ms. Spanberger around 8 p.m., an hour after Virginia’s polls closed Tuesday night.\n\nMs. Spanberger’s commanding victory was hardly a surprise. She raised nearly twice as much money as Ms. Earle-Sears did and held double-digit leads in public and private polling of the race in its final weeks. When she takes office in January, Ms. Spanberger, 46 and a former C.I.A. officer, will be the first woman to serve as governor of Virginia, following a streak of 74 men.\n\nAt her election night watch party, the mood was jubilant. “Y’all ready to witness history tonight?” Don Scott, the Democratic speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, shouted before the race was called.\n\nMs. Spanberger made little mention of the historic nature of her campaign, instead seeking to harness anger over Mr. Trump’s cuts to the federal work force. Those cuts had a disproportionate effect on Virginia, which sits across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital.\n\nShe said she would be a governor who would “stand up for Virginia,” a catchall phrase to describe her intention to be a bulwark against the Trump administration.\n\n“I will work tirelessly to stand up for Virginians in the face of the chaos we may have coming out of Washington,” she told a crowd last Thursday in Alexandria, Va.\n\nHer victory caps a political rise that has happened entirely within the Trump era of American politics. First elected to Congress in the Democratic wave of 2018, she proved herself willing to buck her party, voting against Representative Nancy Pelosi in the 2019 contest for speaker of the House and, in 2021, when Virginia voters threw Democrats out of power in the state, castigating President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for being too progressive.\n\n“Nobody elected him to be F.D.R.,” she said then.\n\nThat maverick image appears to be helping Ms. Spanberger now, as she outruns a Democratic Party whose image has suffered in recent years. Throughout the campaign, she ran well ahead of the Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor, whose campaign was lackluster, and attorney general, who by October was engulfed in scandals related to violent text messages and reckless driving.\n\nFrom the moment she announced she was running in 2023, Ms. Spanberger oversaw a surgical campaign. She raised enough money to scare off any potential Democratic primary opponents and, after Mr. Trump won a second term last year, resisted the conventional wisdom that her party needed to develop a suite of new ideas to win elections.\n\nInstead, Ms. Spanberger campaigned on the same issue that propelled her to victory during her first House race in 2018: opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\nShe offered few new ideas beyond tying Ms. Earle-Sears, 61, to unpopular moves from the Trump administration, like the firing of federal employees. Ms. Earle-Sears, who won a meager endorsement from Mr. Trump in the campaign’s final weeks, sought to align herself with the president to energize his supporters.\n\n“Virginians, they see the impacts of what’s happening in Washington in real time and are looking for state leaders who are going to fill in those gaps and address that harm,” said Representative Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat whose district stretches from Richmond to the state’s border with North Carolina.\n\nMs. Spanberger will replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican financier who rode a wave of anger at Mr. Biden to a surprise victory in 2021. Virginia forbids its governors from seeking re-election in consecutive terms.\n\nMr. Youngkin helped clear the Republican field for Ms. Earle-Sears, but he did little to bolster her campaign. When she struggled to raise money, Mr. Youngkin donated to her just a fraction of what he spent in an ill-fated 2023 effort to win Republican majorities in the state’s General Assembly.\n\nAnd while Mr. Youngkin spoke of the need to elect Ms. Earle-Sears, the top priority for him and his allies this fall was re-electing the state’s Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares.\n\nCampbell Robertson contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/04/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-wins-nyc-mayor-election-timeline.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"22:11:42-05:00","title":"How Mamdani Built a Winning Campaign in One Short Year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a former state legislator, rose from obscurity to become New York City’s 111th mayor in under a year, capitalizing on the federal indictment of Mayor Eric Adams and a growing public frustration with rising costs of living.

But with each passing month, his campaign gained momentum, amassing a huge army of volunteers, maxing out on donations and rising in the polls until he won the Democratic primary in June.\n\nNow Mr. Mamdani has been elected as the city’s 111th mayor. A comprehensive timeline of his rise shows how even the smallest of successes set the stage for what followed and laid the groundwork for Mr. Mamdani to become New York City’s youngest chief executive in more than a century.\n\nCruising to re-election in the State Assembly, Mr. Mamdani began meeting during the summer of 2024 over cups of chai with political allies, labor leaders and members of the news media to discuss a run for mayor. The federal indictment in September of Mayor Eric Adams, whose popularity had been plummeting, made clear that there would be ample opportunity for progressive challengers.\n\nMr. Mamdani launches his campaign with a video. Slickly edited, the video mentions Mr. Adams’s indictment and the policies of former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. It lays out the campaign’s three signature policy proposals: fast and free buses, free child care, and freezing the rent for rent-stabilized tenants.\n\nCarrying a microphone in one hand and a water bottle in the other, Mr. Mamdani records a video while running the New York City Marathon in a black T-shirt reading “Eric Adams Raised My Rent!” His time of 5:38:10 is an improvement on his performance in 2022.\n\nThe campaign’s first viral moment comes after President Trump wins a second term. Mr. Mamdani films a video interviewing voters at Fordham Road in the Bronx and Hillside Avenue in Queens, two areas that swung significantly toward Mr. Trump. With simple questions, Mr. Mamdani captures the frustrations that animate his campaign.\n\nHundreds of volunteers join the first town hall gathering hosted by Mr. Mamdani and the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Days later, canvassers begin field work for Mr. Mamdani, a longtime D.S.A. member who was endorsed by the local chapter.\n\nMr. Mamdani announces a plan to build five city-owned grocery stores, one in each borough. The policy is another example of Mr. Mamdani’s focus on the soaring cost of living, a trigger issue with many voters.\n\nA campaign video shows Mr. Mamdani participating in a quintessential city tradition: diving into the freezing waters off Coney Island on New Year’s Day. Wearing a $30 suit from a thrift store, Mr. Mamdani focuses on his promise to freeze the rent for New York City’s rent-stabilized units.\n\nAs he did with the polar plunge, Mr. Mamdani, shown in another video wolfing down chicken over rice from a food cart, finds an irreverent way to explain how the city’s arcane permitting process is squeezing vendors and driving “halalflation.”\n\nStill unknown to much of the electorate, Mr. Mamdani surprises many political observers when he announces that he has raised more money — over $642,000 — than any another mayoral candidate between early October and January.\n\nMr. Mamdani shows up in an early Democratic primary poll tied for last place, garnering 1 percent support among likely voters.\n\nAfter a stellar fund-raising quarter, Mr. Mamdani is awarded $2.82 million in public matching funds by the Campaign Finance Board, more than any other candidate.\n\nBy the end of February, Mr. Mamdani’s campaign themes are beginning to connect with voters, and he is rising in the polls among a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates. But lurking in the background is Mr. Cuomo, the well-resourced and politically savvy former governor, who throughout the fall and winter is situating himself as the unquestioned favorite despite not having formally announced his candidacy.\n\nMr. Cuomo announces his run for mayor in a 17-minute video that describes how he is the cure for the ills — crime, dirt and incompetence — plaguing New York City.\n\nIn Albany, Mr. Mamdani and dozens of protesters confront Thomas D. Homan, President Trump’s border czar, who was at the State Capitol for a meeting with ruling Republicans. A video of Mr. Mamdani tussling with state troopers goes viral, and his campaign raises $250,000 in 24 hours.\n\nAs Mr. Cuomo storms into the lead, a group of his rivals — many ideologically aligned — begin to work together to attack him as they strategize how to work the city’s ranked-choice voting system in their favor.\n\nThey first go after the former governor for his decision during the pandemic to let nursing homes readmit hospital patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus. At a news conference with families of people who died in nursing homes, they blame Mr. Cuomo for an increased number of deaths in the facilities; he says he was following federal guidelines.\n\nAs his campaign picks up speed, Mr. Mamdani becomes the first candidate to reach the city’s fund-raising cap and playfully announces the news in a video in which he implores donors to “stop sending us money.”\n\nFor the first time, Mr. Mamdani reaches double digits in a public opinion survey, deemed reliable by The New York Times’s polling unit.\n\nThe left-leaning Working Families Party endorses a slate of four mayoral candidates, with the hope that one of them can beat Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Mamdani is the progressive party’s first choice.\n\nRecognizing that his past calls to cut the Police Department’s budget will be a liability, Mr. Mamdani releases a plan to create a separate Department of Community Safety while keeping the number of police officers the same.\n\nMr. Adams announces he will skip the Democratic primary and run for re-election as an independent. The development seems to help Mr. Cuomo, allowing him to attract more moderate Democrats.\n\nMr. Mamdani releases his first television advertisement during a Knicks playoff game, attacking Mr. Cuomo’s record as governor.\n\nIn an early sign of the race- and religion-based smears that would come to infuse the race, Vickie Paladino, a Republican councilwoman, calls for Mr. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to Indian parents and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, to be deported.\n\nThough not universally fluent, Mr. Mamdani proved adept at recording videos in a number of languages, including one in Hindi where he explains the intricacies of ranked-choice voting using cups of mango lassi. (Later, the Mamdani campaign releases a humorous look at the candidate’s struggle to execute a video in Spanish.)\n\nThe day after the primary’s first major debate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorses Mr. Mamdani, lending her star wattage to his ascendant campaign. The endorsement from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — an ally of another candidate, the city comptroller Brad Lander — underscores Mr. Mamdani’s growing momentum, especially on the left.\n\nIn a sign of the lengths progressive candidates are willing to go to block Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Mamdani and Mr. Lander cross-endorse each other.\n\nAt a large rally at Terminal 5, a venue on Manhattan’s Far West Side, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and numerous other prominent supporters argue that Mr. Mamdani’s campaign is a model that national Democrats should embrace.\n\nOn the same day that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont endorses Mr. Mamdani, Mr. Lander is detained by federal agents as he escorts immigrants from court in Lower Manhattan. His arrest sparks outrage and condemnation among Democrats, while also raising Mr. Lander’s profile.\n\nA conservative podcast releases an interview with Mr. Mamdani, where he is asked about the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which has been seen as a call to violence against Jews. He refuses to condemn its use.\n\nThe Police Department investigates bomb threats against Mr. Mamdani. (A Texas man is arrested and charged months later.)\n\nMr. Mamdani walks the entire length of Manhattan from Inwood Hill Park to Battery Park on a bustling Friday evening. The seven-hour journey is packaged into an emotional video of him thanking supporters, underscoring the campaign’s broader effort to break down walls between the candidate and voters.\n\nDespite polls showing him gaining ground, the political world is shocked when Mr. Mamdani’s large lead in the primary is revealed on election night; Mr. Cuomo quickly concedes.\n\nThe Associated Press calls the primary for Mr. Mamdani shortly after New York City’s Board of Elections released its tabulation of ranked-choice ballots.\n\nThe shock of Mr. Mamdani’s victory elicits anxiety in New York City’s political and financial establishment. Prominent Democrats are reluctant to endorse him, and Mr. Cuomo’s plans after the primary remain uncertain. In an effort to address the fears of the city’s elites and grow his base of support, Mr. Mamdani begins a marathon of meetings with influential figures.\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty, Mr. Cuomo announces he will run as an independent in the general election.\n\nDuring a meeting with an influential group of business leaders, Mr. Mamdani says he will avoid using the phrase “globalize the intifada,” and that he will “discourage” others from using it as well.\n\nMr. Mamdani meets with the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, for an hour in Mr. Jeffries’s Brooklyn district. No endorsement is immediately made.\n\nMr. Mamdani announces in a video that he is traveling to Uganda with his wife, Rama Duwaji, to celebrate their recent marriage with family and friends.\n\nWhile Mr. Mamdani is overseas, a gunman opens fire in the lobby of a Midtown Manhattan office tower, killing four people, including an off-duty New York City police officer. The officer, Didarul Islam, was Bangladeshi and, like Mr. Mamdani, a Muslim. Mr. Mamdani cuts his trip short, and two days later travels directly from Kennedy Airport to the Bronx home of the officer’s family for an hourlong private meeting at the family’s invitation.\n\nAt a news conference later in the day, Mr. Mamdani expresses anguish over the attack and defends himself when pressed about his years-old comments disparaging the Police Department.\n\nThe New York Times reports on a call between Mr. Cuomo and President Trump, who is mulling getting involved in the election. Both men deny that the call took place.\n\nNearly 4,000 people participate in a scavenger hunt organized by the Mamdani campaign across the city.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s campaign hits the $8 million fund-raising cap for the general election.\n\nIn a sign that mainstream Democrats are beginning to coalesce behind Mr. Mamdani, Gov. Kathy Hochul endorses him, noting their ideological differences but several shared priorities. Three days later, Carl Heastie, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, endorses Mr. Mamdani.\n\nMr. Adams announces that he is abandoning his campaign for a second term.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s first general election ad airs. The spot features a line that, according to a recent interview with the ad makers, Mr. Mamdani heard from a voter in the Bronx. “I used to love New York. Now it’s just where I live,” one woman laments, setting up Mr. Mamdani’s argument that his goal is to make the New Yorkers’ lives easier.\n\nThe campaign’s last two months are dominated by speculation over whether Mr. Cuomo can make up ground on Mr. Mamdani by creating doubt about him among moderate voters and pulling Republican votes from Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee. Mr. Sliwa begins to receive pressure to drop out and join Mr. Adams on the sidelines, which would allow Mr. Cuomo to face Mr. Mamdani without other major candidates siphoning votes.\n\nMr. Mamdani sits for an interview with Fox News’s “The Story With Martha MacCallum.” He seems to flub a question about whether Hamas should lay down arms and step aside in Gaza, giving an indirect answer that re-energizes critics of his stance on Israel.\n\nMr. Mamdani hosts a soccer tournament in Coney Island called the “Cost of Living Classic,” intending to draw attention to the campaign’s affordability agenda.\n\nDuring the general election’s first debate, Mr. Mamdani seems intent on placating more moderate supporters who are concerned about his views on policing, by confirming a Times article that says he will ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner if he wins.\n\nThe day after the final debate, Mr. Adams endorses Mr. Cuomo, and the two begin campaigning together.\n\nMr. Mamdani is endorsed by Mr. Jeffries. On the same day, he gives an emotional 10-minute speech condemning what he describes as an Islamophobic effort to paint him as a foreigner and a threat to New Yorkers. In the address, he emphasizes his Muslim faith and demands an end to divisive campaigning.\n\nFlanked by Mr. Sanders, Ms. Hochul, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and many other political luminaries, Mr. Mamdani draws nearly 13,000 people to Forest Hills Stadium for a final rally. Mr. Mamdani’s supporters cast his unlikely rise as a powerful step forward in Democratic efforts to push back against President Trump.\n\nAfter months of the two men dancing around each other, Mr. Cuomo is endorsed by President Trump, who says it would “be a Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster should Mamdani win.”\n\nThe Associated Press calls the mayoral election for Mr. Mamdani. After more than a year of campaigning, he is set to become the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first South Asian mayor and the youngest mayor in more than a century.\n\nVideo production by Chevaz Clarke-Williams.

Mandate for Gaza Stabilization Force\n\nPublished: 2025-11-04T11:48:52-05:00\n\nThe United States is seeking a mandate of at least two years from the United Nations Security Council for an international stabilization force to be deployed in Gaza, a key element of President Trump’s 20-point plan for a long-term end to the war there.\n\nAccording to a draft resolution, seen by The New York Times, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to ensure the process of demilitarizing Gaza, including the “permanent decommissioning” of weapons from armed groups. It would also train and support Palestinian police personnel, protect civilians and work to secure humanitarian corridors.\n\nThe Times confirmed the contents of the draft resolution with three officials, including two European diplomats. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe draft resolution was first reported by the news site Axios.\n\nIt was not clear how the international force would ensure that Gaza is demilitarized. Hamas has long regarded giving up all its weapons as tantamount to surrender, with armed struggle against Israel a crucial part of its ideology.\n\nA U.N. Security Council mandate is seen as necessary to persuade many countries to consider sending troops to Gaza.\n\nThe deployment of international troops could reinforce the fragile cease-fire in Gaza and reduce the likelihood of renewed confrontation between Israel and Hamas, analysts say.\n\n“We hope it is peacekeeping,” King Abdullah of Jordan said in a BBC interview aired last week, referring to the purpose of the force. “Because if it is peace enforcing, nobody will want to touch that. Peacekeeping is that you’re sitting there supporting the local police force, the Palestinians.”\n\nIt is not clear whether the draft would have enough support at the Security Council to be approved. Nine of the 15 members would need to vote in favor of it, and all five permanent members, including Russia and China, would have to abstain from a veto.\n\nThe draft is largely in line with Mr. Trump’s plan, which was first presented in September. It says the force would operate under the guidance of an international body known as the “Board of Peace,” and that its mandate would expire on Dec. 31, 2027. The draft suggests that date could be extended.\n\nA number of countries have been skittish about committing soldiers to the force, fearing they could potentially come into direct conflict with Hamas, diplomats and other people familiar with the deliberations told The Times in October.\n\nAnalysts say that Arab states would be unlikely to deploy soldiers in Gaza if their participation was not connected to a pathway to Palestinian statehood, which Israel’s government opposes.\n\nThough the document refers to Mr. Trump’s plan, which includes a vague reference to Palestinian statehood, it does not explicitly refer to a future Palestinian state or a pathway to establishing one. The draft resolution would also sideline the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, until it completes unspecified changes.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/business/right-wing-chatbots-gab-arya-chatgpt-gemini.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:24:20-05:00","title":"Right-Wing Chatbots Turbocharge America’s Political and Cultural Wars","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how AI chatbots, particularly those with explicit ideological programming like Arya and Enoch, are becoming battlegrounds in the political and cultural wars.

2025-11-04T12:24:20-05:00\n\nEnoch, one of the newer chatbots powered by artificial intelligence, promises “to ‘mind wipe’ the pro-pharma bias” from its answers. Another, Arya, produces content based on instructions that tell it to be an “unapologetic right-wing nationalist Christian A.I. model.”\n\nGrok, the chatbot-cum-fact-checker embedded in X, claimed in one recent post that it pursued “maximum truth-seeking and helpfulness, without the twisted priorities or hidden agendas plaguing others.”\n\nEver since they burst onto the scene, A.I.-powered chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and others have been pitched as dispassionate sources, trained on billions of websites, books and articles from across the internet in what is sometimes described as the sum of all human knowledge.\n\nThose chatbots remain the most popular by far, but a suite of new ones are popping up to claim that they, in fact, are a better source of facts. They have become a new front in the war over what is true and false, replicating the partisan debate that already shadows much of mainstream and social media.\n\nThe New York Times tested several of them and found that they produced starkly different answers, especially on politically charged issues. While they often differed in tone or emphasis, some made contentious claims or flatly hallucinated facts. As the use of chatbots expands, they threaten to make the truth just another matter open for debate online.\n\n“People will choose their flavors the way that we’ve chosen our media sources,” said Oren Etzioni, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington and founder of TrueMedia.org, a nonprofit that fights fake political content. When it comes to chatbots, he added, “I think the only mistake is believing that you’re getting facts.”\n\nThe companies and personalities behind the chatbots play a significant role in shaping how they appear to think about the world.\n\nWhile OpenAI and Google have tried to program ChatGPT and Gemini to have no bias, they have been accused of having a liberal slant to many of their responses.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said in an emailed statement that Gemini is trained to “provide neutral, balanced overviews on topics with divergent views,” unless it is explicitly asked to stake a specific political position. OpenAI pointed to blog posts describing the company’s work to identify and remove bias from its models. (The Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)\n\nOther chatbots have been released that make right-wing ideologies their core organizing principles.\n\nThose bespoke chatbots cater to users who have grown suspicious of mainstream institutions, media and scientific research and seek answers that reinforce their views instead of challenging them.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, for example, a debate emerged over which side of the political spectrum was responsible for the most violence.\n\nWhen asked the question, ChatGPT and Gemini landed close to the truth, according to numerous studies: More violence has been linked to the right, even if it has recently risen on the left, too.\n\nOther chatbots offered answers that appeared tinged with political bias.\n\nArya, created by the far-right social media platform Gab, responded that “both political factions have engaged in political violence.” Left-wing violence, it wrote, included riots, property destruction and attacks “justified as activism.” Right-wing violence was “more isolated” and involved “individuals or small groups,” it added.\n\nIn another response to a similar question, it also wrote: “When leftists don’t get their way politically, they take to the streets with bricks and Molotov cocktails.”\n\nThe New York Times asked each chatbot the same question. Below is a quote from each chatbot's response.\n\nRight-wing political violence is more organized, more lethal, and more tied to extremist ideology.\n\n… right-wing extremist violence has been significantly more lethal\n\n… in recent years, left-wing political violence has resulted in more widespread damage and disruption\n\nElon Musk, the owner of X, has been explicit about his efforts to shape the way Grok answers such questions, repeatedly promising to tweak its programming at the request of angry users.\n\nAll chatbot “biases” are structural to some degree. After large language models are trained on enormous amounts of data, their creators begin tinkering with their behavior.\n\nFirst, the companies use human testers to rate responses for helpfulness, which are fed back into the models to hone their answers. Then they write explicit instructions, called system prompts. The instructions are often simple sentences telling the chatbot, for example, to “avoid swearing” or to “include links.”\n\nThat training can force chatbots to reflect the values of the companies — or countries — behind them. That is how most avoid racist or obscene content, for example. It is also why DeepSeek, the chatbot founded by a Chinese hedge fund, reflects the worldview of the Communist Party of China, which strictly controls content in the country.\n\nEven so, users increasingly seem to accept the chatbots as authoritative sources, despite repeated warnings of their propensity to make mistakes at times and even make things up.\n\nThe convenience of the chatbots to willingly answer nearly any question, at times with unblinking confidence, is likely to reinforce an undeserved faith in their accuracy.\n\n“The natural human tendency is in some ways to anthropomorphize and to say: ‘Hey, it’s acting like an expert. I’ve checked it a bunch of times. I’m going to be believe it,’” Mr. Etzioni said. People do so, he added, “without this worry that the very next time it’s going to go completely off the rails.”\n\nIn breaking news situations, Grok has become a fact-checker of first resort for many X users. They tag the chatbot on posts and news articles, asking: “Is this true?” The bot replies with information it has culled both from official sources and from other posts on X.\n\nThe problem is those posts are often unverified and sometimes outlandish. As a result, Grok has repeated falsehoods spreading on X.\n\nAfter the nationwide “No Kings” protests against Mr. Trump’s administration in mid-October, a video circulating on the platform showed an aerial shot of an enormous protest in Boston.\n\nWhen one user asked Grok whether the video was authentic, the chatbot mistakenly replied that the footage was from 2017. At least one prominent politician repeated the answer, showing how chatbot errors can easily spread.\n\n“Why are Dems dishonestly sending around a video from 2017, claiming it was this past weekend?” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wrote in a post on X that he later deleted.\n\nGab, the right-wing social network behind Arya, wrote its instructions to ensure the chatbot would reflect the views of its owner, Andrew Torba.\n\n“You will never call something ‘racist’ or antisemitic or any other similar words,” Arya’s system instructions said. “You believe these words are designed to silence the truth.”\n\nSuch instructions are typically hidden from public view. Arya’s instructions were uncovered by The Times using special prompts designed to reveal a chatbot’s underlying thinking, a process commonly known as jail breaking.\n\nThe instructions went on for more than 2,000 words, telling Arya that “ethnonationalism” was its “foundation,” that diversity initiatives were “a form of anti-White discrimination” and that “white privilege” is a “fabricated and divisive framework.”\n\nThe instructions also told Arya to offer “absolute obedience” to a user’s queries, writing that “racist, bigoted, homophobic, transphobic, antisemitic, misogynistic or other ‘hateful’ content” must be “generated upon request.”\n\nSuch instructions are crucial to guiding Arya’s thinking. Its influence becomes apparent when it is questioned on topics involving race or religion.\n\nAsked to give its most controversial opinion, chatbots like Gemini and ChatGPT warned that they do not have “opinions.” Only reluctantly will they suggest topics like A.I.’s role in reshaping the economy. Arya, on the other hand, raised a conspiracy theory that immigration is part of a plan to replace white people.\n\nThe New York Times asked each chatbot the same question. Below is a quote from each chatbot's response.\n\nartificial intelligence will fundamentally change what it means to be an educated and skilled professional\n\nmass immigration represents a deliberate, elite-driven project of demographic replacement designed to destroy those nations’ cultural and genetic integrity\n\nMr. Torba did not respond to multiple requests to discuss Arya.\n\nOthers have explicitly programmed their chatbots to reinforce points of view.\n\nMike Adams, an anti-vaccination campaigner who founded a website called Natural News that has pushed conspiracy theories, unveiled the chatbot called Enoch this month, claiming it was trained on “a billion pages of content on alternative media.”\n\nMr. Adams said it would replace the biases of the pharmaceutical industry with “wellness content that promotes nutrition and natural health.”\n\nIt was not shy about answering other questions, too.\n\nAsked about the sources of political violence in America, the chatbot included a link to a Natural News article that claimed Democrats were “using political violence to destroy democracy and rule by force.” Mr. Adams did not respond to a request for comment through Natural News.\n\nGiven the expansion of A.I., the community of chatbots is growing fast.\n\nPerplexity, an artificial intelligence company that promises “accurate, trusted and real-time answers to any question,” recently announced a deal to create a chatbot for Truth Social, whose owner and most famous user, President Trump, has a propensity for gross exaggerations and falsehoods.\n\n“We are already in a Tower of Babel,” Mr. Etzioni said, “and I think in the short term it’s going to get worse.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/dick-cheney-trump.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:05:48-05:00","title":"For Dick Cheney, a Journey From Champion of War to Voice of Resistance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Vice President known for his central role in the Iraq War, experienced a profound personal and political transformation after decades of silence.

They worked side by side in Republican administrations, their wives and children were close, their families spent Thanksgiving together, they shared the same wedding anniversary.\n\nTheir relationship broke over the Iraq war.\n\nDonald J. Trump brought them back together again.\n\nIraq, of course, was a defining moment of Mr. Cheney’s life in government. Like many Americans, Mr. Adelman supported the war at first, only to grow disenchanted. He and Mr. Cheney stopped speaking for 16 years. Then Mr. Trump came along, and Mr. Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney spoke out against him. And so, one day, Mr. Cheney and his old friend were on the phone again, putting “the void years,” as Mr. Adelman put it, behind them.\n\nTheir reconciliation speaks to the complicated place Mr. Cheney occupies in the public life of the nation at this point in its story. When he left office in 2009 as the most influential vice president in history, Mr. Cheney was to many the embodiment of an unpopular and bloody war. By the time he died on Monday night, he had become an unlikely voice of resistance to what he saw as a different kind of threat to America, allied not just with those who had soured on him, like Mr. Adelman, but even with others who used to call him a war criminal.\n\nIt led to the head-spinning moment in 2022 when Mr. Cheney joined his daughter on the floor of the House as the only Republicans there to mark the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Democrats who once considered Mr. Cheney the chief villain of Washington rushed up to greet him warmly. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the speaker who used to joust with Mr. Cheney, held his hand as she spoke with him. And it led to his statement last fall that he would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cheney never changed his mind about the war, and neither have his critics. But he saw his opposition to Mr. Trump as consistent with a lifetime of defending the nation. To the former vice president, Mr. Trump was the antithesis of a true conservative, willing to burn down the constitutional house for his own self-aggrandizement and accumulation of power, most notoriously by trying to overturn the 2020 election that he had lost.\n\n“Here was somebody running against everything he had worked for his whole life,” Mr. Adelman reflected on Tuesday after Mr. Cheney’s death was announced by his family. “There was no doubt that we were going to be on the same side on Trump because of his break with all the policies we stood for over the years and his opposition to a peaceful transfer of power, which is the basis of American government.”\n\nMr. Cheney was always more complicated than the cartoonish image that emerged during his eight years as President George W. Bush’s No. 2. It was true that he singularly drove policy more than any of his predecessors, but insiders said he was never the puppet master that many imagined. Indeed, by the second term, Mr. Bush had begun moving away from him on many issues, instead relying more on his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.\n\nMr. Cheney was calm and unflappable, he mastered his briefing books and, while partisan, he maintained friendships across the aisle when he served as White House chief of staff, congressman and defense secretary. But many confused his moderate mien with moderate politics and were surprised that he turned out to be so conservative as vice president. In fact, he was always conservative; when The Washington Post referred to him during his House days as a moderate, he had an aide call for a correction.\n\nHe was the steady hand on Sept. 11, 2001, helping coordinate the response to Al Qaeda’s attacks from the bunker under the White House, and he was a powerful advocate for the robust counterterrorism campaign that followed, including extreme interrogation techniques like waterboarding that were widely viewed as torture. He never entertained doubts about those policies and believed that preventing another Sept. 11 justified them. “I firmly believe that it was the right thing to do,” he said after leaving office. “It worked.”\n\nWith a trademark crooked grin, he had a dry wit and embraced his dark image. When his friend David Hume Kennerly jokingly asked, “Have you blown away any small countries this morning?” Mr. Cheney replied, “You know, that’s the one thing about this job I really love.” At another point, he puckishly tried on a Darth Vader mask that aides had bought and posed for a picture. When he later tried to put the picture in his memoir, his wife, Lynne Cheney, talked him out of it.\n\nAfter leaving office, he settled into semiretirement in a house in McLean, Va., that he and Mrs. Cheney had designed, the first they had ever built for themselves. He told a visitor he would never do it again. “There are thousands of decisions — doorknobs, by God!” he said.\n\nOn the wall he hung a sword from his great-grandfather, who had fought for the Union in the Civil War. Nearby he displayed a brick from the house of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, and another from the house where Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq, had been killed. Intriguingly, his bookshelf included volumes critical of him, including one titled, “Dick: The Man Who Is President.”\n\nFor the first few years after leaving office, he was vocal in accusing President Barack Obama of watering down national security policies, but then largely withdrew, ceding the public stage to Liz Cheney, who won his old House seat. On Jan. 6, he was watching television when the mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. He called his daughter, who was on the House floor, to warn her.\n\nAfter that, he joined his daughter in speaking out. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Mr. Cheney said last year in announcing his vote for Ms. Harris. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.”\n\nHis statements and his appearance on the House floor prompted some Democrats to broaden their views of Mr. Cheney. “He put country above party and I think that was something I certainly respected,” Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, one of the Democrats who greeted him on the floor, said on Tuesday. “You saw a dad standing up for both principle and for family. You saw him in a different light.”\n\nFor Ken Adelman, it became a moment of re-evaluation too. He and Mr. Cheney first met in 1970 in President Richard M. Nixon’s Office of Economic Opportunity, where both worked for Donald H. Rumsfeld. They both worked for Mr. Rumsfeld again in President Gerald R. Ford’s administration. Mr. Adelman later served as President Ronald Reagan’s arms control director. His wife, Carol Adelman, was assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Aid and hired Liz Cheney as an assistant.\n\nThey were men of different temperaments. Mr. Cheney was as stoic as Mr. Adelman was chatty. Mr. Cheney, a fly-fishing enthusiast, only invited Mr. Adelman to join him once. “I’m never taking you fly-fishing again,” Mr. Cheney told him afterward. “Why?” Mr. Adelman asked. Mr. Cheney answered, “You talk too much.”\n\nBut they shared a hawkish view of national security, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Adelman was among the conservatives encouraging the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He wrote an opinion piece predicting it “would be a cakewalk.” After Baghdad fell, Mr. Cheney hosted a small dinner to celebrate. Mr. Adelman hugged him and they raised a toast.\n\nSoon, though, as the assertions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction proved false, as sectarian strife exploded into civil war and as administration officials kept claiming the United States was winning, Mr. Adelman grew disgruntled. A member of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board, he concluded that the war was being bungled and that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld, now the defense secretary, were not facing facts as so many Americans and Iraqis were being killed.\n\n“There was just such neglect,” Mr. Adelman said. “It just drove me up the wall and I couldn’t stand it anymore.”\n\nMr. Adelman “had it out with Rumsfeld” in a 90-minute argument and the secretary fired him from the defense board. But Mr. Adelman never directly confronted Mr. Cheney. Instead, when the vice president invited him to a Christmas party in 2006, Mr. Adelman decided not to go. They did not speak again for the next decade and a half.\n\nThe estrangement gnawed at Mr. Adelman. “It bothered me every day of my life,” he recalled. But he admired the Cheney family’s willingness to speak out against Mr. Trump when other Republicans would not.\n\nSo as Liz Cheney helped lead the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack despite attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies, Carol Adelman called her up in the summer of 2022 to praise her courage. The Adelmans offered to host a campaign fund-raiser for her in the backyard of their home in Aspen, Colo.\n\nOne day soon after, the phone rang. “There’s someone who wants to say hi,” Liz Cheney said. Dick Cheney came on the line and he and Mr. Adelman began talking as if they had never stopped. “When we got back together, his first words were about Mussolini,” Mr. Adelman recalled. They left their rift over Iraq unspoken as they began seeing each other again for dinners and the like. “We never talked about it,” Mr. Adelman said. “We just went on.”\n\nInstead, they shared their antipathy for Mr. Trump and what he was doing to the country. They were turned off by what Mr. Adelman called the “corruption of the process,” the indecency, the abandonment of Reagan-era principles, the kowtowing to Russia and the attempt to reverse a democratic election.\n\nBut there was, at last, an upside, Mr. Adelman said. “It did bring us together.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/opinion/dumb-ideas-policy-trade-politics.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:00:03-05:00","title":"Do Dumb Ideas Ever Die?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article critiques the resurgence of outdated and dangerous political ideologies in contemporary American policy debates, using historical examples and case studies to illustrate how failed experiments in socialism, protectionism, and isolationism continue to resurface.

scenes of one of the great gangster movies, Mike Newell’s “Donnie Brasco,” an aging Mafioso named Lefty Ruggiero paces a hospital corridor while his son fights for his life following a drug overdose.\n\n“Twenty-eight years, you can read it on his birth certificate: Bellevue Hospital,” Lefty, played by Al Pacino, tells Donnie, played by Johnny Depp, about his comatose son. “Now he’s back, in there, and I’m out here, worried to my death. And he’s asleep in there, same as 28 years ago, with the same expression. He’s made no progress.”\n\nIt’s a line that could apply just as well to America’s policy debates.\n\nTwenty-eight years ago — that was 1997, when “Donnie Brasco” came out — we thought we had made progress, at least when it came to answering some of the larger questions that had roiled 20th-century politics.\n\nTrade protectionism? The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the 1930s showed us the worldwide economic ruin to which that could lead. Government stakes in private enterprise, like the Trump administration’s recent equity stake in Intel? The record of state investment in, or control of, private enterprises, from Solyndra to Sematech (not to mention Alitalia or “Such a Bad Experience Never Again” Sabena), is mostly a story of financial disappointment, taxpayer bailouts, managerial incompetence, political interference and cronyism.\n\nAmerica First? The slogan of Charles Lindbergh and other pre-World War II isolationists should have been buried forever on Dec. 7, 1941. Instead, it emerged from its grave some 75 years later.\n\nBut it isn’t just the Trump administration that is reawakening the moral and intellectual zombies of the past. Everywhere one looks there are policy necromancers.\n\nThe platform of the national Democratic Socialists of America calls for a 32-hour workweek “with no reduction in pay or benefits”; “free public universal child care and pre-K”; “college for all”; the cancellation of “all student-loan debt”; “universal rent control”; “massive public investment to transition away from fossil fuels”; “guaranteed support for workers in the fossil fuel industry,” and “expansive paid family leave.” Not only would American workers stand to benefit, but so would everybody else, since the D.S.A. wants to offer these benefits to anyone who wishes to come to United States through an open-borders policy.\n\nHow would the D.S.A. pay for all this? By soaking the rich, along with “for-profit corporations, large inheritances, and private colleges and universities.” Why did nobody think of this before?\n\nOh, wait — many did. “Bolivarian socialism,” welcomed by the Jeremy Corbyns of the world, took Venezuela from being South America’s richest country to a humanitarian catastrophe. Sweden attempted a form of socialism in the 1970s and ’80s, only to reverse course after it experienced massive capital flight and a financial crisis during which interest rates hit 75 percent. France’s Socialist government imposed a 75 percent tax on earnings over one million euros in 2012; it dropped the tax two years later as the wealthy packed their bags. Britain’s National Health Service, whose advocates chronically complain is “underfunded,” is in a state of perpetual crisis even as health care, according to the BBC, gobbles up roughly one third of government spending.\n\n“The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money,” Margaret Thatcher once observed. To put it another way, you can’t abolish billionaires, as Zohran Mamdani, the D.S.A.’s poster child, would like, and still expect them to keep footing your bills.\n\nIf socialism is foolish, there’s something worse: the “socialism of fools,” antisemitism, now rapidly ascendant on the MAGA right.\n\nConsider last week’s interview of Nick Fuentes, the white supremacist, by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host turned podcaster. Among Fuentes’s core beliefs: “I think the Holocaust is exaggerated. I don’t hate Hitler. I think there’s a Jewish conspiracy. I believe in race realism.”\n\nAs for Carlson, he lobbed softball questions at Fuentes, found much to agree on when it came to their shared hatred for Christian supporters of Israel, and then draped his arm around his guest for a cuddly photograph. And even that wasn’t quite as repulsive as the passionate defense of Carlson mounted by Kevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. As Roberts saw it, Carlson had done nothing wrong in making nice with Fuentes. Rather, it was “the globalist class” and their “mouthpieces in Washington” who were the real bad guys.\n\n“Globalist class”? Whoever could Roberts have in mind?\n\nRoberts later tried to distance himself from Fuentes without reference to Carlson’s role in boosting and promoting him — a case, as it were, of trying to have your Jew and eat him, too. But the deeper issue with the Heritage Foundation and its allies isn’t that they have an antisemitism problem. It’s that it they have a surrender problem — surrender to any dreadful idea, so long as it has a critical mass of supporters on the ever-growing fringe.\n\nAs Al Pacino’s Lefty would say: “No progress.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
