Holmes, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:55 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s  hopes for a quick meeting  with Russian President Vladimir Putin may be stalled after sources familiar with the matter told CNN that an expected pre-meeting between the world leaders’ key foreign affairs aides this week had been tabled, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Thursday after a call with Putin that the two “agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week.”\n \n\n   \n  “The United States’ initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  However, that anticipated meeting between Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov has been put on hold for the time being, a White House official told CNN. It was not immediately clear why the meeting was no longer taking place this week, though one of the sources said Rubio and Lavrov had divergent expectations about a possible end to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  It was also not immediately clear what impact the tabling of the pre-meeting between Lavrov and Rubio would ultimately have on the anticipated Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently worked towards finding a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to end this senseless war and to stop the killing,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told CNN. “He has courageously engaged parties on all sides and will do everything in his power to achieve peace.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubio and Lavrov on Monday had a phone call and discussed “next steps” to follow up on the call between their two presidents last week about a possible end to the conflict in Ukraine, according to a brief US State Department readout of the call. Rubio “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump’s vision,” according to the readout.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, described the call as a “constructive discussion” that dealt with “possible concrete steps to implement the understandings” Trump and Putin reached on the call.\n \n\n   \n  A source familiar with the matter told CNN, though, that officials felt after the Rubio-Lavrov call that the Russian position has not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance. For now, the source said, Rubio is not likely to recommend the Putin-Trump meeting move forward next week, but Rubio and Lavrov could speak again this week.\n \n\n   \n  It has been more than two months since Trump held his last  in-person summit  with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. That meeting, which went on for nearly three hours, ended without a deal as both leaders touted progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to  “stop the war immediately.” \n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters Saturday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/omaha-emergency-landing","dateOfPublication":"1000-03-01","timeOfPublication":"10:25:00-05:00","title":"Plane Makes Emergency Landing After Pilots Lose Contact With Flight Attendants and Hear Knocking on Cockpit Door","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, Flight 6469, made an emergency landing in Nebraska after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard knocking on the cockpit door.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said over the summer that the “state ballroom” would occupy space housing the East Wing of the executive mansion, where first ladies have traditionally maintained offices.\n \n\n   \n  The project fulfills a 15-year ambition by the president to construct an event space on the White House grounds that expands the building’s entertaining capacity — but also resembles  the gilded spaces  of his private clubs. The ballroom is just one part of Trump’s  efforts to transform  the buildings and grounds to his liking, which have included adding large flagpoles, paving over the Rose Garden, and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\n \n\n   \n  “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump posted on social media Monday evening. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also commented on the construction during an event celebrating LSU baseball teams in the White House’s East Room earlier Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “You know, we’re building right behind us — we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”\n \n\n   \n  Renderings provided by the White House depict a vast space with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, gold floor lamps and a checkered marble floor. Three walls of arched windows look out over the White House’s south grounds.\n \n\n   \n  The new ballroom — which will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion, the White House said — will have a seated capacity of 650 people, more than three times the space in the East Room, the largest event space in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At  a recent dinner  with high-dollar ballroom donors, Trump said the new space would be “in keeping” with the White House architecture. He said it will be “appropriate in color and in window shape.”\n \n\n   \n  “There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  During the dinner, the president said he was told there were “zero zoning conditions” set for the project.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘How long will it take me?’” Trump recalled. “‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday  shared a screenshot  from  Smithsonian Magazine  of construction at the White House during the 1950s, in response to what he called “pearl clutching” after images of the demolition surfaced.\n \n\n   \n  The photo he posted was taken during the Truman administration, when the White House underwent a complete reconstruction after engineers discovered it was “structurally weak and in danger of collapse,” according to the  White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  “Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House,” Cheung wrote on X. “Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized.

territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, according to European officials briefed on the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who would later  endorse a freeze in current battle lines  as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The episode was the latest chapter in the fraught relationship between the two men, and amounted to another shift in Trump’s approach to how the war will be settled. Last month, after meeting Zelensky in New York, Trump claimed Ukraine might be able to regain all its territory lost to Russia. But now Trump is preparing for another high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  It was after a call with the Russian leader on the eve of the Zelensky meeting that Trump again insisted Kyiv must give up swaths of land for the conflict to end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump shrugged off the apparent reversal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I never said they would win it. I said they could win,” he said of Ukraine at the White House, where he was meeting the prime minister of Australia. “Anything could happen. You know, war is a very strange thing. A lot of bad things happen. A lot of good things happen.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he still believed Ukraine could win, but that he didn’t think it would.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky emerged from that meeting to brief European leaders on a call in which he sounded pessimistic about Trump’s position, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source separately called the White House meeting “tense,” but said there was “no shouting,” downplaying reports of a volatile encounter between the two leaders. Overall, the source called the meeting constructive, since Trump ultimately declared that a ceasefire be along the current frontline. Zelensky later endorsed the idea in remarks to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the European characterization of the meeting, the White House pointed to comments Trump made Sunday on Air Force One. “We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle lines,” he said. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that.’”\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, ending the Russia-Ukraine war is now a top priority after he brokered a truce between Israel and Hamas to end the conflict in Gaza. He emphasized the need to end the war quickly in Friday’s talks, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In his phone call with Trump a day earlier, Putin proposed a plan where Ukraine would surrender the eastern Donbas region in exchange for some Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the European official said.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal, which the officials characterized as a slightly less sweeping demand than what Putin raised during his August summit with Trump in Alaska, would still amount to a major loss of territory for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later arrived at the position of ending the war along the current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Sunday denied he asked Zelensky to concede the entire Donbas region, which Ukraine views as strategically important.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,” he said on Air Force One. “They should stop right now at the battle lines. … Go home, stop killing people and be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump told reporters he had asked Putin during their phone call to stop attacks on civilian areas but went on to talk about how many soldiers are dying.\n \n\n   \n  Several people familiar had previously told CNN that last week’s Trump-Zelensky meeting was tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” with the two leaders split over the future of the war.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the  long-range missiles that can reach far into Russia  that he was seeking. One US official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna on Monday disputed that the meeting was “aggressive” or “negative,” saying that it was “a dialogue” on ending the war. She said Trump and Zelensky left their meeting Friday with “full clarity” on “next steps.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the European officials, Zelensky and his delegation came to the White House with maps showing current battle lines, hoping to convince the US president to maintain and expand American support. Trump seemed uninterested in the arguments, and forcefully insisted Ukraine agree to land concessions for the war to end, they said.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview taped last week, Trump said for the war to end, Putin was “going to take something, he’s won certain property.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has told those around him that his demand for a ceasefire along current battle lines was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Both sides need to make a deal,” another US   official said arguing the conditions are only going to get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cast the meeting as a “pointed conversation” in a post to social media but said its outcome “can really help bring this war closer to an end.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional comments from President Donald Trump. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes, Victoria Butenko and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/middleeast/hamas-gaza-hostage-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-20:00","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Deceased Hostage as Sergeant Major Tal Haimi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the body of deceased hostage Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old IDF officer killed on October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led attack.

Defense Forces said. He was 41 years old at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, four children, father and sister, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  Haimi is the 13th deceased hostage to be transferred and identified since the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal was signed on October 9.

The latest transfer comes amid diplomatic efforts in the region aimed at pushing forward the next phase of the Trump administration’s ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF called on Hamas to “take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect.  Israeli intelligence  has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are  needed to recover the bodies  in Gaza after two years of war caused significant destruction in the territory.\n \n\n   \n  One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the ceasefire agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest news comes after the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza appears to have survived its first major test over the weekend – with both Hamas and the Israeli military accusing the other of violations – and amid anxiety in Israel over the delayed release of deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana said Monday that the ceasefire agreement, including the return of all deceased hostages, must be fulfilled “one way or another,” according to a Knesset spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n    Diplomatic push continues\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the Trump administration’s ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump threatened to “eradicate” Hamas if it doesn’t abide by the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have to, they’ll be eradicated, and they know that,” Trump said, warning that if the violence in Gaza continues, “we’re going to go in and straighten it out, and it’ll happen very quickly and pretty violently.”\n \n\n   \n  US troops would not be involved in any renewed fighting, Trump said, insisting that other forces are in place and ready to carry out orders should he decide that Hamas has violated the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire deal’s key architects, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner held lengthy meetings with senior IDF generals in Tel Aviv on Monday to discuss ceasefire arrangements in Gaza, an Israeli source with knowledge on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The source said the meetings took place in the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, during which Witkoff and Kushner met with the IDF’s head of Intelligence Directorate, Major General Shlomi Binder, and the head of the Planning Directorate, Major General Eyal Harel.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer and the Prime Minister’s military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, also participated, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/kada-scott-update-remains-identified","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-04:00","title":"Remains Found Behind Abandoned School Belong to Missing Philadelphia Woman, Kada Scott","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Philadelphia, the remains of 23-year-old woman Kada Scott, who had been missing for about two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school.

Those charges were dropped when the victim and a witness did not appear for court proceedings, Krasner said.\n \n\n   \n  Scott, who worked in an assisted living facility, was remembered Monday in a statement by her parents as a source of “light, kindness and beautiful spirit.” They said their hearts were “shattered” and asked for prayers.

Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. If every Democrat on the committee opposes Ingrassia, and Scott joins them, that would be enough to block the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the White House should pull Ingrassia’s nomination, Thune told reporters, “I hope so,” and chuckled before adding, “He’s not going to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump nominated Ingrassia in May to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s  KFile   has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, as well his claims that straight White men are the most intelligent demographic group.\n \n\n   \n  His nomination has drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia has also been scrutinized for his ties to  Nick Fuentes , a noted White nationalist and Holocaust denier, as well as his defense of Fuentes’ ability to post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Homeland Security Chairman Rand Paul would not say if he’d oppose Ingrassia, but he noted that the administration will have to decide if it is comfortable with Ingrassia’s nomination moving forward.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that ultimately, there are a lot of questions on the nomination that the White House has to make a determination whether they think his nomination can get through, and we’re going to wait and hear from them what their thoughts are, whether they’ve talked to all the Republican members, and whether they think they have the votes,” Paul told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Other GOP senators refused to say if they’d back Ingrassia and said they want to hear from him on Thursday. “It sounds like there’s new information out tonight, I haven’t seen,” said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. “I’m sure we will welcome the opportunity to have his hearing on Thursday and respond to folks’ questions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added that he hasn’t “delved into it yet,” but he imagined they’d learn more on Thursday, and Oklahoma Sen.

However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi.”\n \n\n   \n  In a later statement to Politico, Paltzik said, “In this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages, which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context, is extremely difficult. What is certain, though, is that there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs.

Japan’s first female leader \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, Hanako Montgomery, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:13 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A  staunchly conservative  politician with a penchant for heavy metal is poised to make history on Tuesday as  Japan’s  first female prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  Sanae Takaichi’s expected accession to the role, just days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to Asia, is a landmark moment for Japan – a historically patriarchal country with deep-rooted gender norms, where both politics and workplaces remain dominated by older men.\n \n\n   \n  The road to the premiership was all but cleared for Takaichi on Monday night when her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which, despite its name, is conservative – formally joined forces with the opposition Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party).\n \n\n   \n  She now needs to secure just two more votes in the lower house of parliament when Japan’s legislature votes on a new prime minster on Tuesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi was elected head of the LDP earlier in October, after a leadership race was triggered when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba  announced he would resign. \n \n\n   \n  Her election as party leader – beating out more moderate candidates – suggests a rightward turn for the scandal-hit LDP, which suffered bruising losses in the last two parliamentary elections and is  looking to win back voters  who’d switched to new far-right parties.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve picked a colorful character to take the helm. Photos of Takaichi’s younger days have circulated widely on social media, specifically her love for motorcycles – like the Kawasaki Z400GP she rode until becoming a lawmaker in 1993, when she gave it up – and her passion for heavy metal drumming, which she still indulges in at home when she’s stressed.\n \n\n   \n  But she’s also deeply conservative, which has alarmed more centrist party members. For instance, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and often visits a controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II. She also opposes a growing movement to allow married couples to use separate surnames.\n \n\n   \n  Some of these stances – such as her hawkish views on China – could complicate Japan’s regional relationships. And within Japan, some worry about her economic proposals – to spend big and cut taxes – as the country struggles with sky-high inflation and living costs.\n \n\n   \n  If she is elected prime minister on Tuesday, tackling the high price of goods will be one of her first challenges; for instance, the price of rice, a staple food in Japan, has almost doubled from last year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the ever-present headache of Japan’s declining birthrate, shrinking workforce and swelling elderly population. There’s a growing public backlash against mass immigration. And then there is the Trump administration and its whiplash tariffs, which shook Asian economies earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the immense challenge of winning back public trust, with the LDP experiencing its biggest crisis in decades and being stripped of its parliamentary majority under Ishiba, after a political slush fund scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Simply being elected as the leader of the ruling party would usually have been enough to secure the premiership. But Takaichi’s path to power was complicated; already needing to find a new way to secure a majority, the LDP’s coalition partner of 26 years, Komeito, suddenly terminated its alliance with the party when she won the leadership race.\n \n\n   \n  Her party’s new political ally, Nippon Ishin, shares some of her conservative values – like tougher immigration controls – and have secured a commitment to cut the number of lawmakers by 10% as part of its coalition deal. But Nippon Ishin have other desires too, like making  Osaka, its hometown power base,  Japan’s second capital city.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s party hopes she can be the answer to their recent unpopularity. But with a revolving door of prime ministers that has cycled through four leaders in the last five years, Japan’s so-called ‘Iron Lady’ will need to deliver results quickly to stay in power.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/tylenol-fda-label-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"Tylenol’s maker pushes back against possible label change linking pain reliever’s use in pregnancy to autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen products to reflect a potential link between its use in pregnancy and autism or ADHD in children.

Such filings are a way for individuals, industry or consumer groups to ask the agency to take action on a specific issue.\n \n\n   \n  The petition says that because of the “urgent public health implications,” the FDA should act quickly to add a more detailed warning to the labels of over-the-counter drug products that contain acetaminophen to spell out that “studies show that frequent use of this product during pregnancy may increase your child’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Kenvue asked the FDA to deny the petition, saying that suggested changes to the label are unsupported by scientific evidence “and would represent an unexplained departure from FDA’s longstanding position on acetaminophen during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  The company said it met with Kennedy in early September, after the HHS secretary reached out to say he believed there was a connection between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, and it told him there was no such link.\n \n\n   \n  An HHS spokesperson said Monday that the FDA doesn’t comment on product-specific matters.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA  website on acetaminophen  has not changed to reflect the Trump administration’s views. It says it was last updated in August and specifies, “to date, FDA has not found clear evidence that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.”\n \n\n   \n  Acetaminophen has been studied for decades to find any problems it may cause in pregnancy,  according to the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.   Not one reputable study has concluded that acetaminophen use in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.\n \n\n   \n  That group points to a study  published  last year of more than 2 million children that found no significant associations between  acetaminophen use  during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.\n \n\n   \n   Another study  published in August analyzed 46 studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Six of the studies specifically examined acetaminophen use and autism. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the paper could only show an association, the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend judicious acetaminophen use — lowest effective dose, shortest duration — under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk–benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation,” the researchers wrote in that analysis.\n \n\n   \n  After the Trump news conference, medicine regulatory agencies for  the European Union  and  the United Kingdom  and  Health Canada  quickly issued statements confirming that taking the over-the-counter pain-reliever during pregnancy remains safe.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/baseball-mlb-blue-jays-mariners-alcs-game-7","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-04:00","title":"George Springer’s epic home run helps send the Toronto Blue Jays to the World Series with ALCS Game 7 win over Seattle","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a dramatic Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, advancing to their first World Series since 1993.

\nUpdated: \n        11:41 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Toronto Blue Jays  are headed to their first World Series since 1993 after a dramatic 4-3   win over the  Seattle Mariners  in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.\n \n\n   \n  Things were looking bleak for the Blue Jays until designated hitter  George Springer  delivered a huge three-run home run in the seventh inning as Toronto surged into the lead.\n \n\n   \n  Springer’s late-inning heroics set up a compelling World Series match-up pitting the American League’s best team against the defending champion  Los Angeles Dodgers .\n \n\n   \n  The Mariners opened the must-win game with an exciting first inning that featured a little bit of everything. Julio Rodriguez opened the game with a lead-off double down the left field line to set the table for Seattle.\n \n\n   \n  Seattle’s MVP candidate, Cal Raleigh, then struck out swinging at a high fastball, but Josh Naylor picked up his teammate with a single to drive in Rodriguez with the game’s first run.\n \n\n   \n  Controversy followed when Jorge Polanco hit a groundball to Toronto third baseman Ernie Clement, who was shaded toward shortstop. Clement took the ball to second base himself and whipped the ball towards first base for a would-be inning-ending double play.\n \n\n   \n  But Clement’s throw ricocheted wildly off the helmet of baserunner Naylor, allowing Polanco to reach first base safely. Replays showed Naylor turn his back toward the oncoming throw and leap into the air as the ball caromed off the crown of his helmet.\n \n\n   \n  After a huddle in the infield, the six-man umpiring crew determined that Naylor had deliberately obstructed Clement’s throw and called Polanco out at first to end the inning.\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays carried that momentum into the bottom of the first inning and tied the game 1-1 on a soft groundball single from Daulton Varsho.\n \n\n   \n  After a scoreless second inning, Rodriguez led off the third inning with a solo home run off Shane Bieber to put the Mariners back in front 2-1. The blast was Rodriguez’s third of the series.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh, who led MLB with 60 home runs during the regular season, smacked his fifth long ball of the playoffs, his fourth against the Jays, to extend the M’s lead to 3-1 in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  The mood was getting very nervous in Toronto’s Rogers Centre as the game reached the seventh inning stretch with the home team trailing and time running out on the Blue Jays’ season.\n \n\n   \n  But a walk and a softly hit single set the stage for Blue Jays’ lead-off hitter  Springer, the 2017 World Series MVP with the Houston Astros.\n \n\n   \n  Facing Eduardo Bazardo, fresh into the game from the bullpen, Springer cranked a three-run homer to catapult the Blue Jays into the lead for the first time in the game at 4-3. The crowd at the Rogers Centre erupted as Springer rounded the bases as the unforgettable moment played out.\n \n\n   \n  Toronto then turned to its bullpen to close the game out,\n \n\n   \n  Chris Bassitt pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth, striking out all three Mariners batters he faced to end the game and send the Canadian crowd into ecstasy.\n \n\n   \n  After the victory, Springer was asked about what he would remember about his dramatic moment. A modest Springer replied, “The at-bats before me. If it’s not for those guys, that moment doesn’t happen.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m so happy for our team, our fans, our city, our country. I am so happy right now,” he told Fox Sports while the joyous crowd cheered.\n \n\n   \n  Springer was forced to leave Game 5 of the series after getting hit in the knee by a pitch and appeared to be in discomfort in Games 6 and 7. When asked about the pain, he doubled down on his love for Toronto. “I owe it to these fans, this city, this country to give it my all. It doesn’t matter. So, I’ll take it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Toronto superstar Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was named ALCS MVP after batting .385 and crushing three home runs in the series.\n \n\n   \n  The Blue Jays will host the Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series on Friday at Rogers Centre in Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  As for the crestfallen Mariners, they remain the only franchise in Major League Baseball yet to appear in a World Series.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/nicholas-rossi-utah-rape-conviction-sentencing-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-20:00","title":"Man accused of faking his own death and fleeing the US after rape charges gets at least five years in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicholas Rossi, 38, a man with a history of sexual abuse and multiple aliases, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008.

death and fleeing the US after rape charges gets at least five years in prison \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Utah judge on Monday sentenced a man who appeared to  fake his death and flee  the United States to avoid arrest on rape charges to anywhere from five years to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas Rossi, 38, is “a serial abuser of women” and “the very definition of a flight risk,” District Judge Barry Lawrence said before handing down the sentence.\n \n\n   \n  It was Rossi’s first of two sentencings after separate convictions in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November in the second case.\n \n\n   \n  Utah allows prison sentences to be given as a range rather than a set period of time. A parole board will determine if and when Rossi is released. Five years to life is the entire range of possible prison time under Utah law for rape, a first-degree felony.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a  three-day trial  in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi left a “trail of fear, pain and destruction” behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a plea for vengeance,” she said. “This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi posed a risk to community safety and should be in prison, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, before the sentencing. Rossi’s lawyers, meanwhile, urged the judge to give him parole.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi did not testify on his own behalf during the trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, he maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,” Rossi said in a soft, raspy voice. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and used an oxygen tank.\n \n\n   \n  Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to  clear its rape kit backlog .\n \n\n   \n  Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on February 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  He was  arrested in Scotland  the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos – including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended – from an Interpol notice.\n \n\n   \n  He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\n \n\n   \n  In his first trial, Rossi’s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. Even so, the jury convicted Rossi of the rape charge for which he was sentenced Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in the case had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.\n \n\n   \n  She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn’t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.\n \n\n   \n  She went to police years later, after hearing that Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi was convicted in that case in September and sentencing is set for November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/trump-san-francisco-national-guard-legal-battle-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:13:00-11:13","title":"Appeals court allows Trump administration to deploy National Guard in Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration’s request to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, overturning a prior district court decision.

Nelson and Bridget S. Bade, sided with the administration’s appeal while a third, former President Bill Clinton appointee Judge Susan P. Graber, dissented, saying, “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s ruling, from the White House’s point of view, proves the lower court’s decision was incorrect, according to Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  The president has cited  protests outside  Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the call-ups of troops in the deep blue city.   \n \n\n   \n  “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a  statement  Monday. “We are on a dangerous path in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the Ninth Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an en banc review in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a Ninth Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. ﻿While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  The state plans to file its own petition for an en banc review, a spokeswoman for the Rayfield’s office said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday, October 22, to make their case for or against an en banc review.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m very troubled’\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle in Oregon wages on, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  virtual press conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  Kotek echoed the sentiments in Judge Graber’s dissent and asked that the Ninth Circuit review the case again given the seriousness of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a really important development that the one judge in the 2-1 ruling was immediately calling on their on her colleagues, to vacate this order,” Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, Kotek added, it is unclear where troops would be deployed or how many would federalized, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Kotek, along with other leaders in Oregon, has  emphatically disputed  the president’s characterizations of the city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Oregon’s biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were “fundamentally un-Constitutional, dangerous for American civil rights” and risk “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as   President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco as his administration continues an effort to crackdown on a growing list of cities it claims to be ridden with crime.\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago it went wrong, it went woke,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The president told Bartiromo the cities he feels are in need of troop deployment are almost exclusively “Democrat-run,” describing them as “unsafe” and “a disaster.” Trump also claimed he could, at any moment, invoke the  Insurrection Act  – a seldom-used law that allows the president to deploy military forces in the US in certain limited situations.\n \n\n   \n  The mobilization of National Guard troops to cities like Chicago; Memphis, Tennessee; and Portland, Oregon, has been met with fierce backlash from residents as well as local and state leaders – including some who have gone so far as to sue the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Federal deployments have also sparked pop-up protests in these cities and helped fuel a second  “No Kings” rally  over the weekend, where millions took part in more than 2,700 events across the country to protest the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the latest on Trump’s efforts to federalize troops in several US cities:\n \n\n   \n    San Francisco\n \n\n   \n  Trump toyed with the idea of deploying federal troops to the Bay Area last week when he told FBI Director Kash Patel that San Francisco was among the “great cities that can be fixed.”\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets,” California state Senator Scott Wiener, whose district includes San Francisco,  said on X . “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: Stay the hell out of San Francisco.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump initially received support from Bay area tech billionaire and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who told the New York Times ahead of his “Dreamforce” AI conference last week, he backed Trump’s troop deployment to the city. But Benioff later backtracked,  saying on X  he does not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco and his comments were made out of “an abundance of caution around the event.”\n \n\n   \n  “I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has not directly commented on Trump’s comments, but said in a news conference last Friday crime in the city is  down 30%  – the lowest point in decades.\n \n\n   \n  The city has faced a shortage of police officers but recently reported its largest surge of recruits in years, according to the  San Francisco Police Department , with 3,375 entry-level applications so far this year, up more than 40% from last year.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Newsom  sued the Trump administration  in June over the federalization of the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles and joined a  lawsuit in Oregon  earlier this month over Trump’s attempt to send federalized troops in Los Angeles to Portland to respond to protests there.\n \n\n   \n    Memphis\n \n\n   \n  A group of seven elected officials in Tennessee filed a lawsuit against the state’s governor and attorney general last week, challenging the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Memphis  Mayor Paul Young,  defended the city, noting crime has fallen by double-digit percentages since last year, but acknowledged the situation is different from efforts to fight the federalization of troops in Portland or Chicago,  CNN affiliate WMC  reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Memphis is different than L.A. and Chicago or Portland in that the governor of Tennessee and the president of the United States made the decision to bring the National Guard and the federal resources to the City of Memphis,”  Young said Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said last week she hoped troops would help direct traffic and have a presence in public retail spaces, but not operate at checkpoints, the AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “From a public safety standpoint, we’re trying to utilize Guard personnel in non-enforcement types of capacities, so it does not feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities, in our neighborhoods, and that’s not where we’re directing those resources, either,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago in a court filing Monday asked the US Supreme Court to block the Trump administration emergency request to keep National Guard troops in the state to help combat protests and perceived crime despite objections from local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a district court issued a temporary restraining order against the federalization and deployment of troops in the city. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit partially stayed that ruling, allowing federalization but not deployment. The temporary restraining order expires Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether to allow the deployment while the legal battle continues.\n \n\n   \n  The filing says there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing that the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview as “small” and manageable by local authorities and saying they “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops take over, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s appeal of the temporary restraining order ,  the administration said the lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal describes the situation in Chicago as threatening, asserting that federal officials there have been “assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Chicago became the focus of courtroom discussions last week with a judge  demanding answers  from federal authorities over violent encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis said recent news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration was not following her instructions to limit use of force and actions against journalists documenting Chicago protests.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week expanded her restraining order, requiring all federal agents with body cameras involved in quelling protests to have them on when encountering demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Her order, however, does not require agents to wear body cameras if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Department of Homeland Security policy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/world/europe/timeline-louvre-robbery-intl-latam-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:05:00Z","title":"Inside the Louvre heist that stunned the world","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A daylight heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris has drawn global attention, with the theft of Napoleonic-era artefacts—referred to as 'France’s crown jewels'—being described as 'the heist of the century'.

And in a response to his indictment, Comey said on social media that “there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Requests by defendants for their charges to be dropped based on a claim that they’re being unfairly targeted are rarely granted, but  legal experts have said it’s possible judges could be more receptive to such efforts  in cases like Comey’s given the bevy of public comments by Trump and other officials attacking people the Justice Department is criminally pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  As part of Monday’s filings, Comey’s legal team provided  Judge Michael Nachmanoff  with an extensive list of public statements capturing the former FBI director’s criticism of Trump, and Trump’s subsequent posts attacking Comey. Comey’s lawyers called Trump’s posts “smoking evidence” of an unfair prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “In response to Mr. Comey’s protected speech, President Trump has resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,” Comey’s lawyers wrote. “The pattern of President Trump’s statements and actions demonstrate a clear intent to subject Mr. Comey to ‘[o]fficial reprisal for [his] protected speech.’”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys are also asking the judge to give them permission to pry into the Justice Department’s “prosecutorial decisions” behind its conclusion not to charge other officials who served in top positions in Trump’s first administration.\n \n\n   \n    Disqualifying the US attorney\n \n\n   \n  Comey is arguing that the indictment against him should be thrown out because Trump’s appointment of the interim US attorney who brought charges was entirely unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appointed White House adviser  Lindsey Halligan , who brought the Comey indictment herself, as the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after the former interim US attorney,  Erik Siebert,  was forced out amid pressure to bring a separate indictment against New York Attorney General  Letitia James. \n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys argued that the previous interim US attorney had already served the legally allotted 120-days that someone can serve as interim before needing to be confirmed by the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not able to appoint a new interim and avoid the senate confirmation process altogether, Comey’s attorneys argue, calling the move a scheme to “circumvent” Congress’ role in the confirmation process.  \n \n\n   \n  Any differing interpretation of the Constitutions’ Appointments Clause would “allow the government to string together sequential 120-day appointments,” his attorneys added, “and thereby indefinitely or perpetually evade Congress’s default requirement of Senate advice and consent.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys pointed to Trump’s own indictment in Florida to argue Halligan’s appointment was unlawful, noting that a federal judge dismissed the case on similar grounds.\n \n\n   \n  In that case, special counsel Jack Smith – who was appointed by the attorney general at the time – charged the then-former president with unlawfully retaining classified documents at his Florida estate following his first term.\n \n\n   \n  The federal judge presiding over that case dismissed the charges against Trump, concluding that Smith’s appointment had “not been authorized by law” because, in part, Congress had not approved his appointment.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a dismissal with prejudice is sufficient to address and deter the Executive Branch’s willfully unlawful conduct in this case,” Comey’s attorneys concluded.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/atlanta-airport-man-arrested","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"18:18:00Z","title":"Man Arrested Inside Atlanta Airport After Making Threats to ‘Shoot It Up’","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man named Billy Joe Cagle, a convicted felon with a prior marijuana offense, was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted law enforcement that he was armed and planning to 'shoot it up'.

not going to wait for one company’: NASA chief suggests SpaceX may be booted from moon mission \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  NASA may sideline SpaceX and choose a different company to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade, acting space agency chief Sean Duffy suggested during TV appearances Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy emphasized that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.\n \n\n   \n  “They push their timelines out, and we’re in a race against China,” Duffy told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday morning, referring to SpaceX’s development of Starship — the vehicle the company plans to use as a lunar lander for NASA. “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX.”\n \n\n   \n  If NASA were to cancel or amend its contract with SpaceX, it could signal a remarkable reversal of a plan the space agency has had in place since 2021. That’s when NASA chose Starship — which is still in the early stages of development and has racked up three in-flight failures and a couple  successful suborbital test flights  so far in 2025 — to serve as lunar lander during the historic moon landing mission, called Artemis III.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy’s remarks on Monday come as that 2021 decision is facing new scrutiny from space industry leaders who are concerned that the logistics involved with using SpaceX’s Starship are too complex and may cause NASA to lose the new moon race, as  CNN previously reported . The Artemis III moon-landing mission is currently set to take place as soon as mid-2027.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on Duffy’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n    What could happen next\n \n\n   \n  The exact timeline for NASA to potentially alter its deal with SpaceX or bring on a new contractor was not immediately clear. In a separate interview on Monday with Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Duffy said he’s “in the process of opening that contract up,” referring to the Artemis lunar lander agreement.\n \n\n   \n  NASA already has two different companies contracted to provide lunar landers: SpaceX with its Starship vehicle, and Blue Origin, the space venture founded by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, which is developing a lander called Blue Moon.\n \n\n   \n  It is Starship, however, that is slated to fly the Artemis III mission in 2027, which would mark the first time astronauts have set foot on the lunar surface since the Apollo program concluded five decades ago. (Blue Origin, which received its NASA contract in 2023, is looking to use Blue Moon to complete Artemis missions later in the program, such as  Artemis V .)\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens said that the space agency gave SpaceX and Blue Origin until October 29 to present “acceleration approaches” for lunar lander development.\n \n\n   \n  “NASA is also going to request plans from the entire commercial space industry - through an RFI (or Request for Information) - for how NASA can increase the cadence of our mission to the Moon,” the statement reads. “President Trump and Secretary Duffy have a mission to beat China back to the Moon. That’s why they are harnessing the power of the American space industry and seeking solutions to develop more ways to land on the Moon.”\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of Artemis III has been the focus of hawkish lawmakers concerned that the landing will not occur before taikonauts — or Chinese astronauts — reach the moon. China has said it will accomplish that feat by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks to CNBC, Duffy suggested it could be Blue Origin that takes over SpaceX’s position in the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s request for comment regarding Duffy’s remarks, Blue Origin said only that it is “ready to support.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Duffy also warned that NASA may opt to open up the competition more broadly to providers that do not yet have contracts.\n \n\n   \n  “If SpaceX is behind, but Blue Origin can do it before them, good on Blue Origin,” Duffy said. “But … we’re not going to wait for one company. We’re going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if NASA’s plans to issue a RFI will result in any new companies securing contracts. In government contracting parlance, RFIs are typically considered part of an informal fact-finding process whereas Requests for Proposals, or RFPs, are a more formal solicitation.\n \n\n   \n  Space industry experts have expressed concerns about the timelines for both SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon, noting that the vehicles are complex and may need to be refueled in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In-orbit refueling has never been attempted, the experts noted, and lunar landers requiring such a step could require prohibitively long development timelines.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what other US companies may be in a position to join SpaceX and Blue Origin in competing for NASA Artemis contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Dynetics, an aerospace company based in Alabama, was among the companies that originally bid for a lunar lander contract alongside Blue Origin and SpaceX. Dynetics did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/sonya-massey-deputy-murder-trial-what-we-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"18:42:00Z","title":"What to know about the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff deputy who killed Sonya Massey","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a murder trial centered on the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, a Black woman in Springfield, Illinois, by deputy Sean Grayson on July 6, 2024, the case has ignited national debate over police use of force, especially against Black individuals in their homes.

killed Sonya Massey \n       \n  By Associated Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:42 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jury selection has begun in the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff’s deputy charged with killing  Sonya Massey , a Black woman shot in her home last year after calling police for help.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Grayson, 31, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, fired on the 36-year-old Massey in her Springfield home early on July 6, 2024, after confronting her about how she was handling a pan of hot water Grayson had ordered removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  Security was uncharacteristically tight in Peoria, where the trial has been moved. A police tactical team was deployed around the downtown courthouse and snipers were seen on rooftops surrounding the perimeter.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes and it prompted a change in Illinois law requiring fuller transparency on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  An outdoor protest drew about 60 people, an organizer said. They held signs that read, “The People Demand: End Police Terror” and “United Now Against Racial Violence.” James Wilburn, Massey’s father, watched jury selection in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  Questions for prospective jurors from both sides probed attitudes toward law enforcement during a time of intense feelings for or against police. Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser’s questions focused solely on jurors’ relationships with officers or organizations, their monetary or volunteer support and whether they would have trouble justifying a guilty verdict against a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Milhiser closed his questioning by asking for a show of hands from jurors who believed police officers may use whatever level of force they deem necessary in doing their jobs — none did. The defense likely will argue that Grayson was justified in his use of force because of the pan of hot water Massey held.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Dan Fultz gauged panel members’ comfort level in returning a not guilty verdict but spent considerable time asking jurors generally about personal obligations and simply whether they wanted to be impaneled.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, attorneys had nearly completed questioning a second pool of a dozen jurors; from the first panel, four had been chosen to serve on the 12-person jury.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their homes  and prompted a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the charges:\n \n\n   \n    Trial relocated due to national attention\n \n\n   \n  In addition to first-degree murder, Grayson is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Widespread attention to Grayson’s shooting of Massey prompted Sangamon County Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles southwest of Chicago. Jurors will instead come from Peoria and surrounding areas, an hour’s drive north, and will hear the case in their local courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n    Body camera footage shows shooting\n \n\n   \n  After Grayson and another deputy checked the area around Massey’s house, Grayson knocked on her door to report they had found nothing suspicious, body camera video shows. He entered the house to obtain details for a report, noticed a pan on the stove and ordered its removal. Massey picked it up.\n \n\n   \n  She laughingly asked Grayson why he was backing away; he said he was trying to avoid the “hot, steaming water.” Massey responded, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson wrote in an incident report, “I interpreted this to mean  she was going to kill me .”\n \n\n   \n  According to body camera video, Grayson pulled his 9 mm pistol and yelled at Massey to drop the pot. She apologized then put the pan down and ducked behind a counter, but in the confusion, as Grayson yelled, it appears she picked it up again.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson fired three times, hitting  Massey once just below the left eye .\n \n\n   \n    Massey’s family had sought mental health care\n \n\n   \n  Massey, a single mother of two teenagers who had a strong religious faith, was beset by mental health problems. When she answered Grayson’s knock minutes before the shooting, she said, “Don’t hurt me,” and then, as she was questioned and Grayson asked her if she was all right, she repeatedly said, “Please God.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier that same week, Sonya Massey had admitted herself to a  30-day inpatient mental health program  in St. Louis but returned two days later without explanation.\n \n\n   \n  In the days leading up to the shooting,  three 911 calls were made  by Massey or on her behalf, county records indicate. In one, her mother, Donna Massey, told authorities her daughter was suffering a “mental breakdown.” Donna Massey also told the dispatcher, “I don’t want you guys to hurt her.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was not aware of the calls or Massey’s background. County officials have since said there’s no practical way to determine and communicate such information for police responding to emergency calls.\n \n\n   \n    Deputy’s history prompted state reform\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was  arrested 11 days after killing Massey and fired  from the sheriff’s department.\n \n\n   \n  As his background was scrutinized, Massey’s family and others questioned why Grayson, who had been a Sangamon County deputy sheriff for 14 months,  had been hired at all .\n \n\n   \n  In his early 20s, he was ejected from the Army for a drunken-driving arrest in which he had a weapon in his car. He was convicted of a DUI again within the year.\n \n\n   \n  Before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department, Grayson had four policing jobs in six years – the first three of which were part-time.\n \n\n   \n  There was no indication Grayson had been fired from any job, but evaluations from past employers documented concerns about him. One department reported that while Grayson worked hard and had a good attitude, he struggled with report writing, was “not great with evidence – left items laying around office” and was “a bragger.”\n \n\n   \n  Jack Campbell, the Sangamon County sheriff,  was forced to retire  six weeks after the shooting. He insisted none of Grayson’s issues disqualified him from working as a deputy.\n \n\n   \n  State law enforcement authorities had certified Grayson to serve in each of his previous jobs, but Campbell  required him to attend the 16-week police academy  training course nonetheless.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker  signed a law requiring  that prospective police officers permit the release of all personal and employment background records to any law enforcement agency considering hiring them. Legislative sponsors of the measure acknowledged it doesn’t prevent candidates with checkered paths from being hired but provides greater transparency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/brett-james-ntsb-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00-04:00","title":"Songwriter Brett James’ plane enters a 'tightening spiral' before crashing, NTSB says","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Grammy-winning songwriter and music industry collaborator, Brett James, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, in Franklin, North Carolina.

tone down and record Chicagoland protest actions \n       \n  By Whitney Wild, Andi Babineau, Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:22 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials are defending themselves in court as a federal judge demands explanations for their response to tense protests against immigration enforcement actions in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s hearing began with a promise Customs and Border Protection is taking seriously the judge’s order for its agents to wear and use body-worn cameras: Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis then calmly peppered Harvick with questions about how agents working on Operation Midway Blitz are trained and respond to protesters in and around Chicago, the latest target of President Donald Trump’s  immigration crackdown . The hearing was called in response to news reports suggesting agents were violating her order to avoid less-lethal munitions and tear gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis,  an Obama appointee , initially had called for the interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, Russell Hott, to appear Monday “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” After seeming to agree to her request, the Department of Homeland Security told Ellis on Friday that Hott had left the city to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration instead offered Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, and Ellis agreed – as long as the officials would disclose how the agencies are deploying riot control tactics against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking at it from the outside,” Ellis said in court Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said Monday, however, she will allow Hott and Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent at CBP, to be deposed at a later time.\n \n\n   \n  She added since Hott was the highest officer in Chicago at the time the protests occurred, he should be able to speak to what happened.\n \n\n   \n  The judge last week added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls on them.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” Ellis said then.\n \n\n   \n  Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE  deployment  across Chicagoland, yielding more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent  demonstration  in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. A government attorney  last week  said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n    Judge wants answers\n \n\n   \n  Ellis early this month issued a  sweeping order  restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During  last week’s hearing , she said she had concerns about her order being followed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge indicated recent news reports had led her to believe the Trump administration may not have been following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” Ellis said in a stern tone. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” she said from the bench.\n \n\n   \n   The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras. But her order doesn’t require them if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials claimed Harvick would be the most appropriate person to testify after DHS determined it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in recent tear gas incidents, CNN affiliate  WTTW reported .\n \n\n   \n  During a telephone hearing that day, the judge said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government presents at Monday’s hearing but that she’s been “very clear” she wants to hear from someone who can fill her in on “what’s been going on over the last week,” the station reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” Ellis said, according to WTTW. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”\n \n\n   \n    Protests continue at Broadview\n \n\n   \n  This weekend  marked  the first since a fence was ordered removed at the Broadview ICE facility, the center of anti-ICE protests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday in connection with another demonstration at the facility, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Byers, the ICE deputy field office director, said Monday he has reviewed incidents involving protesters at the facility and no one has been disciplined.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/americas/colombia-fallout-trump-petro-feud-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Colombians Caught in Fallout of Trump-Petro Feud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombians are expressing widespread anxiety over a growing diplomatic feud between US President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro.

of frustration and worry amid an escalating  diplomatic feud  between the leaders of Colombia and the United States.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombia, which he sees as largely having failed to combat drug cartels producing illegal narcotics and shipping them to the US.\n \n\n   \n  In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs.” Petro responded by saying Trump was “rude and ignorant” toward the South American nation.\n \n\n   \n  The remarks — the latest in  series of barbs  between both leaders — have fueled anxiety among Colombian citizens, who fear the spat could have serious consequences for their lives.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s right that the just pay for the sinners. If Trump imposes more tariffs, many jobs will be lost, and many companies will go bankrupt,” said Ángel Duarte, a Colombian taxi driver.\n \n\n   \n  If new tariffs are imposed, the impact on trade would be substantial, as the United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of Colombian exports, according to Colombia’s National Association of Foreign Trade. Oil, coffee, flowers, gold, fruits and manufactured goods are the main products that depend on US purchases. An increase in tariffs would make key exports more expensive and affect workers and consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Sofia Anaya, a housewife in Colombia, worries that the feud will also affect people’s ability to obtain visas. “I have my daughter in the United States, and I have to renew my visa this year,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She argued that Petro brought this upon himself, given the number of times he has insulted Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Petro has previously clashed with the Trump administration on migration and drug-trafficking issues. In September, he called for US officials, including Trump, to face “criminal proceedings” over US strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The US later  revoked Petro’s visa  after he spoke at a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York and called on US soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian university student Gustavo Cuesta, meanwhile, faulted the US president. “Calling President Gustavo Petro a drug trafficking leader is an insult to the entire country. And it must be rejected,” he said. “Trump is not the owner of the world. One must show respect.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Gaitán, a retiree in Colombia, said both presidents deserve criticism: “They both speak without considering the consequences. Meanwhile, the drug traffickers remain calm. Here in Colombia, the drug issue has no solution. There’s a lot of money involved.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s threat to cut off funding would cause Colombia to lose its largest provider of economic and military assistance in the fight against drug trafficking, including resources for the eradication of illicit crops such as coca and opium poppies, which are used to produce cocaine and heroin. Funds total about $450 million annually, although Trump has not specified which items he would cut.\n \n\n   \n  “Petro has to find a way to solve this with the gringos,” said Duarte. “In the end, it’s the people who are hurt.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/gaza-ceasefire-trump-polls","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"16:04:00Z","title":"Americans shrug at Trump’s Gaza deal, as economic fears reign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the public reaction to President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire deal, which was initially seen as a major foreign policy victory.

as economic fears reign \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:04 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Perhaps nobody on Earth is as consumed with claiming credit for achievements — both real  and exaggerated  — as President Donald Trump is. But when it came to the  Gaza ceasefire deal  last week, even many of Trump’s critics didn’t begrudge him a prolonged victory lap.\n \n\n   \n  A week later, though, the situation appears to have meant little if anything on the domestic front.\n \n\n   \n  Not only has the tenuousness of the agreement come into sharp focus, with Vice President JD Vance leading a delegation to Israel this week as the deal hangs in the balance, but Trump’s political standing appears almost unchanged at home, if not worse.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most remarkably: Americans don’t even seem to be particularly enthused about Trump’s handling of the Gaza issue.\n \n\n   \n  The situation appears to reinforce that negative views of Trump are largely baked-in at this point, and that negative views of his handling of domestic issues — especially the economy — are likely to continue to carry much more weight.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve now seen two quality polls conducted after the announcement of the ceasefire deal on October 8. Both show Trump’s approval is virtually unchanged. And though his numbers on Gaza appear to have ticked up, not even that appears to be a strength.\n \n\n   \n  An  AP-NORC poll  released Friday showed Trump’s approval rating on Gaza improving from 37% in September to 47%. (The poll was conducted October 9-13.) But about the same number disapproved: 49%.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s overall approval split was actually worse than at any point in his second term, with 37% approving and 61% disapproving. Those numbers rival Trump’s worst numbers since his first year in office in 2017.\n \n\n   \n  The story was similar in a  CNBC poll  released Friday.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Trump remained significantly underwater on the issue of the war in Gaza, with Americans disapproving 50%-41%.\n \n\n   \n  It also showed Trump’s approval rating at a second-term low, with Americans disapproving 52%-44%.\n \n\n   \n  How could this be, after what was viewed as such a major win for the president on the world stage — something that even some Trump critics said lent credence to his  lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize ?\n \n\n   \n  One possibility is that views were still forming, with much of the polling conducted between the deal being struck and Trump’s travel to the Middle East for his  victory lap . The fact that Trump’s ratings on Gaza, specifically, weren’t that great might suggest people weren’t tuned in.\n \n\n   \n  But recent events suggest even such a bump, if it were to materialize, could be just as fleeting, given tensions are rising in the region again. And it also seems possible Americans are taking a wait-and-see approach, recognizing how often we’ve seen hope for Middle East peace suddenly evaporate. (It was just in January, after all, that the Biden administration  struck its own ceasefire deal,  which lasted about two months.)\n \n\n   \n  The more likely interpretation, though, resides in that age-old political adage: “It’s the economy, stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  It hasn’t gotten as much attention in recent weeks, but Trump’s numbers on the economy continue to deteriorate — especially as the apparent negative impacts of the president’s tariffs set in and inflation proves stubborn.\n \n\n   \n  The CNBC poll is a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  It shows views of Trump’s handling of inflation and the cost of living hitting a new low, with Americans disapproving 62%-34%. He’s also 13 points underwater on the broader issue of the economy — his worst net approval rating on that topic in either his first or second terms.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also suggests pessimism is setting in. It shows new lows in the percentages of Americans who say they expect the economy to improve over the next year (32%) and for their own wages to rise (31%).\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of employed Americans who say they’re not at all worried about losing their jobs has also dropped to 52% — which is lower than at any point in the final three years of the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Those are striking numbers, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the American people place much more emphasis on them than on the Gaza issue. That’s especially given other polling has shown foreign policy issues are very low on Americans’ priority list. Just 4% in a recent  CBS News-YouGov poll  ranked international events as the most important issue facing the country.\n \n\n   \n  The same poll showed three-fourths of Americans don’t think Trump has focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe people are less concerned with Nobel prizes than they are grocery prices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:49:00Z","title":"Seven U.S. Universities Reject White House Funding Offer with Ideological Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has offered expanded federal funding to nine universities—initially including the University of Arizona, University of Virginia, MIT, Penn, Brown, USC, and others—in exchange for adopting a series of ideological policy changes, such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment, and defining gender based on biological processes.

Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:49 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the University of Arizona declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of seven schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter addressed to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella said, “We seek no special treatment and believe in our ability to compete for federally funded research strictly on merit.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Arizona’s refusal comes after the University of Virginia rejected the offer after a meeting at the White House on Friday. USC, Penn, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an  unprecedented level of control over universities  – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, seven have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, the University of Virginia, and the University of Arizona.\n \n\n   \n  University of Arizona President Garimella said in response to McMahon’s letter, “We have much common ground with the ideas your administration is advancing on changes that would benefit American higher education and our nation at large.” But, “a federal research funding system based on anything other than merit would weaken the world’s preeminent engine for innovation, advancement of technology, and solutions to many of our nation’s most profound challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n  Vanderbilt University Chancellor Daniel Diermeier rejected reports that the Nashville university had been asked to accept or reject the compact. “We have been asked to provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue, and that is our intention,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that “academic freedom, free expression and independence are essential for universities to make their vital and singular contributions to society.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/louvre-heist-jewels-recovery-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"Looted Louvre Treasures May Never Be Found, Experts Say, as Museum Remains Closed","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris was robbed of historic jewelry, including a diadem and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise, in a fast and brazen heist that took less than 10 minutes.

\nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Louvre  museum in Paris announced it would remain closed Monday as investigations continue into Sunday’s extraordinary  theft of historic jewelry  – and experts say the prospects of recovering the treasures are slim.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on X, the museum said it regretted Monday’s closure, as France begins to digest the implications of the brazen heist in which robbers made off with artefacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n    How did the heist happen?\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.\n \n\n   \n  Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutors say it took the robbers four minutes to break into the gallery, snatch the jewelry, and leave.\n \n\n   \n  “At 9:34 a.m., half an hour after opening, two men wearing yellow vests broke a window,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Monday statement. The robbers “left at 9:38 a.m,” and left on two scooters “along the banks of the Seine.”\n \n\n   \n  The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n    What was stolen?\n \n\n   \n  Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n    Wider implications for France\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Will the jewelry be recovered?\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it’s lost forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Past heists\n \n\n   \n  The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum’s walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.\n \n\n   \n  It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.\n \n\n   \n  More recent heists at other European museums include the  theft of four ancient gold artefacts  from a museum in the Netherlands in January.\n \n\n   \n  Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:   This story has been updated to reflect that there was a theft from the Louvre in 1998. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article

Whitaker pointed to a Biden administration attorney who ran the civil division at DOJ without being Senate confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “When the attorney general designates someone that is a distinct kind of service,” Whitaker told the panel. “Congress recognized nonetheless we can keep the lights on and we can continue to have officials exercise functions purely by delegation.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there is an expiration to delegated authority, Whitaker said there is not. He was adamant that the administration was not trying to circumvent the normal practice of Senate confirmation, but admitted they’ve “jumped through hoops” to get their people in place. To prove that they’re trying to follow the normal practice, he noted that 16 US attorneys were recently confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ is appealing a  lower court’s ruling  that found Habba is serving in the role unlawfully after finding the administration violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which guides the process for how Senate confirmed positions should be made. That decision prompted challenges in other states, including Nevada where the US attorney appointed there was also found to be serving improperly. Another challenge over the US attorney for the Central District of California is currently being litigated.\n \n\n   \n  The concept is also expected to be raised by former FBI Director James Comey as he fights federal charges brought by former White House aide Lindsey Halligan. Halligan, who is now US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also brought the criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Comey and James have denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which includes New Jersey, heard arguments on Monday. Two of the judges were appointed by Republicans – President Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush – and one judge by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Habba was initially serving as interim US attorney for New Jersey until that term expired after 120 days. She resigned and was named special attorney, designated as first assistant US attorney and then delegated the authority of the US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Defendants in two cases argued she was serving unlawfully. A district court judge agreed and found that the first assistant US attorney at the time of the vacancy should automatically fill the position and if that isn’t possible, the president can appoint someone who is Senate confirmed or has been serving in the Justice Department for at least 90 days.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department also argued that Habba can serve through authority delegated by the attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker said there are different ways to fill vacancies across government and they are selecting which laws to invoke. “We are not asking for limitless power to designate officials,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker said Habba can serve in her role until February when a term of 200 days expires, but conceded if Habba is serving under delegation authority there is no expiration.\n \n\n   \n  Abbe Lowell, who argued on behalf of the defendants, said DOJ is “constructing this gerry-rigged way to get Ms. Habba to be in power.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowell said the attorney general can delegate authority but only for a specific role, such as the designation of a special attorney to investigate mortgage fraud, but all the power of a US attorney – overseeing criminal and civil investigations, giving speeches, and moving personnel – cannot be delegated.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never happened,” he told the panel. “In their interpretation the only thing she doesn’t have is the certificate on the wall that says ‘US attorney,’” Lowell said.\n \n\n   \n  A judge pressed Whitaker on his contention that this is a common practice and then recited the multiple steps that played out over a week to reassert Habba to serve essentially as US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  “Can you come up with an example of any time that such a catenation of events has occurred with respect to the appointment of a United States attorney,” the judge asked Whitaker.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess I cannot,” Whitaker said. He said the judges should find that Habba has authority to supervise cases the same way assistant US attorneys are authorized to conduct criminal investigations – through authority that traces back to the attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  Following the court hearing, Habba placed the blame on Congress, where lawmakers have blocked the nominations of over a dozen US attorney candidates.\n \n\n   \n  “The President appoints individuals to carry out the mission of this administration and that mandate should be respected. When millions of Americans voted for a change in leadership in November, they voted for a new direction. That choice should not be undermined by political obstruction in Congress or by criminal defendants,”  Habba wrote on X .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/murdaugh-family-deaths-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"City Health Department Issues Public Health Advisory on Respiratory Illness Outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The City Health Department has issued a public health advisory regarding a recent outbreak of respiratory illness, first reported on April 10, 2024.

He was found guilty in March 2023 in a  closely watched case  and  sentenced  to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh’s attorneys appealed for a new trial based on allegations of jury tampering; legal briefs have been filed but it’s unclear when the state Supreme Court will consider the case.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, Murdaugh, an attorney who was later disbarred, pleaded guilty to dozens of federal and state charges of financial crimes related to a wide-ranging scheme to bilk his law firm, clients and the government out of about $9.3 million, according to the  state attorney general .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a timeline of all the twists and turns in the Murdaugh family saga:\n \n\n   \n    1920-2006\n \n\n   \n  Over three generations, a member of the Murdaugh family has served as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, which leads prosecutions for Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties in the southern part of South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Randolph Murdaugh Sr. was elected to the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office in 1920 and served in the position until his death in 1940.\n \n\n   \n  His son, Randolph Murdaugh Jr., took over the position and served until his retirement in 1986.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh Jr.’s son, Randolph Murdaugh III, was elected to the role in 1987 and served through the end of 2005.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh III’s son, Alex Murdaugh, worked as an attorney at the law firm Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick, known as PMPED.\n \n\n   \n  In 2006, then-Gov. Mark Sanford appointed attorney Duffie Stone to serve as the 14th Circuit solicitor, making him the first non-Murdaugh in the position. He has been elected to the position five times since, most recently in 2024, according to  the solicitor’s website .\n \n\n   \n    2018\n \n\n   \n  Gloria Satterfield, a longtime housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, dies in what is described as a “trip and fall accident” at the Murdaugh home, according to attorney Eric Bland, who represented her estate.\n \n\n   \n  After Satterfield’s death, a $500,000 wrongful death claim was filed against Alex Murdaugh on behalf of her estate,  Bland said .\n \n\n   \n    2019\n \n\n   \n  A boat crashes at a bridge near Parris Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, on February 24, killing 19-year-old Mallory Beach, according to the South Carolina attorney general in documents obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Six people were on board at the time, including Alex Murdaugh’s 19-year-old son, Paul. Murdaugh owned the boat.\n \n\n   \n  Stone recuses himself from the case because of personal connections.\n \n\n   \n  Paul Murdaugh is indicted in April on charges of boating under the influence (BUI) causing great bodily harm and causing death in connection to the crash, court records show.

He says he had visited his ailing mother in Almeda and returned to find his wife and son dead.\n \n\n   \n   June 10:  Randolph Murdaugh III dies peacefully at his home at age 81,  according to his obituary .\n \n\n   \n   June 15:  SLED releases basic information about the June 7 killings, saying Alex Murdaugh called 911 at 10:07 p.m. and investigators collected evidence that night and the next morning.\n \n\n   \n   June 17:  Alex Murdaugh’s brothers, John Marvin Murdaugh and Randolph “Randy” Murdaugh IV, speak to “ Good Morning America ” about the killings.

are attempting to bring into court doubts that former FBI Director James Comey’s lead defense lawyer can represent him fairly, given Comey’s history being investigated, in a new legal dispute in the case that Comey’s team has already called an “effort to defame.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors suggested late Sunday that Patrick Fitzgerald could have “potential conflict and disqualification issue” in the case because Comey may have used the attorney to disseminate classified material in 2017 – an allegation Comey’s attorneys called “provably false.”\n \n\n   \n  In a filing over evidence, prosecutors say “quarantined evidence” in the case contains communication between Comey and Fitzgerald.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzgerald, citing a report from the Justice Department’s inspector general who investigated the allegations previously, noted that “the report ‘found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to the media.’”\n \n\n   \n  “After Mr. Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, he sought legal advice with respect to his termination and with regard to having witnessed behavior by the President that he considered unlawful,” Fitzgerald wrote in Monday’s responsive filing.\n \n\n   \n  Comey was fired a few months after Trump took office, following his agency’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is always a dicey situation,” former federal prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said of the DOJ’s filing on CNN this morning. “Look, you are never supposed to be both a lawyer and a witness in the same case.”\n \n\n   \n  If Fitzgerald was “part of one of these chains of leaks that Jim Comey allegedly set up,” Honig said, “Fitzgerald, even if he’s just a witness, he generally cannot then be a defense lawyer in the case.”\n \n\n   \n  The former FBI director had written “seven contemporaneous memoranda about his troubling interactions with President Trump,” in 2017, Fitzgerald noted, adding that Comey shared several of the memos with his attorneys, none of which, he claims, contained classified information.\n \n\n   \n  “The memoranda were unclassified at the time they were shared with counsel–Mr. Comey both authored the memos and was an Original Classification Authority,” Fitzgerald wrote, adding that the government later chose to “upclassify” the memos.\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorney concluded: “Contrary to the government’s assertion, a later upclassification does not change the fact that when the memoranda were initially transmitted, they were in fact unclassified.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

becomes the latest Republican trying to push him out of NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:20 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republican New York City mayoral candidate  Curtis Sliwa  is facing renewed pressure to drop his bid for mayor – this time directly from his boss.\n \n\n   \n  John Catsimatidis, the Republican supermarket magnate and lifelong New Yorker, took to the airwaves of WABC-AM, the radio station he owns and where Sliwa hosts a show, to call for him to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I love Curtis; we’ve worked together a lot,” Catsimatidis said.\n \n\n   \n  “Curtis has to realize that he should love New York more than anything else, and it certainly looks like Curtis should pull out right now,” Catsimatidis added.\n \n\n   \n  Catsimatidis and some other Republicans  have rallied behind Andrew Cuomo , who is running as an independent, in a bid to stop  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  from becoming mayor. Cuomo and his allies are pushing Sliwa to drop out after successfully getting  Mayor Eric Adams to leave the race , arguing the former New York governor could then consolidate opposition to Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, who has worked for WABC radio for decades, has been on leave from the station since launching his bid for mayor, according to a release issued by Catsimatidis.\n \n\n   \n  The back-and-forth over Sliwa’s future in the race appears to have only emboldened him. Having drawn new attention from his  performance in Thursday’s debate , Sliwa has dismissed Cuomo and his backers as he argues voters should have the last word when it comes to New York City’s future.\n \n\n   \n  During an  interview  posted Saturday with YouTube journalist Nate Friedman, Sliwa rebuked Cuomo and high-profile backers, including Bill Ackman, who has been sharply critical of both Sliwa and Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “Now he’s saying I can’t win without Sliwa votes – where are your votes? He’s got millions from the billionaires, millions – go out, get you a vote, convert Sliwa voters,” Sliwa said of Cuomo. “But for me to drop out? I represent a major party line. This is called voting. Since when do we not let people vote? Billionaires determine the next mayor? If they don’t like it, they can leave, they have options. Blue-collar working-class people don’t; those are the people I am representing, not Andrew Cuomo.”\n \n\n   \n  Catsimatidis’ comments come a day after President Donald Trump was asked whether he would get involved in the race for mayor and support Sliwa. Trump has been dismissive of the Republican nominee, referring to him as “not exactly primetime,” and mocking Sliwa’s affinity for cats and animal rescues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I a big fan?” Trump said Sunday, speaking to Fox News. “This isn’t exactly ideal, where he wants to make Gracie Mansion a home for the cats you know?”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, best known for founding the Guardian Angels crime group, is a perennial mayoral candidate who ran in 2021 and has never held political office. He’s polling third in the current race behind Mamdani and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has openly appealed to Republicans, trying to cast himself as the moderate choice against Mamdani. He has tried to discredit Sliwa, referring to him as a “shock jock” and arguing anyone who does not support Mamdani should vote for him and not Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “Curtis Sliwa is not an alternative, he’s not a viable candidate,” Cuomo said over the weekend speaking on Fox News. “You vote for Curtis, you might as well vote for Zohran Mamdani directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments have made Mamdani and Sliwa strange bedfellows, to the point that aides to Cuomo have started to suggest Mamdani and Sliwa are coordinating.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about it Monday, Mamdani laughed off the suggestion.\n \n\n   \n  “That is one place where Curtis and I agree, which is, it’s time for New Yorkers to make this decision, not for billionaire donors to determine who gets to run in this city,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he was advising Sliwa to stay in the race, Mamdani said, “My advice to him is continue making his own case. I’m focused on making my own case to New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/entertainment/lance-bass-diabetes-nsync-reunion","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"13:30:00-14:30","title":"Lance Bass Has More to Say About Living with Diabetes Than an *NSYNC Reunion","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lance Bass, former member of the boy band *NSYNC, addresses public speculation about a potential reunion tour by stating there is no current plan, emphasizing that fans should not believe all rumors.

Specifically: the wrongful deportation of  Kilmar Abrego Garcia .\n \n\n   \n  Could it now be happening with another legally dubious and highly punitive Trump effort in Latin America?\n \n\n   \n  We learned last week that one of the most recent Trump administration strikes on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean  failed to kill two of the people aboard .\n \n\n   \n  The situation has now cast a spotlight on the holes in the administration’s justifications for the strikes, which  were already suspect . But now the dilemma over what to do with the survivors has crystallized that fact and injected the situation with new urgency.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Republicans have questioned the legality of the strikes, and the events of last week could make it more difficult to move on — as Trump’s GOP critics have often been wont to do.\n \n\n   \n  To recap: The administration, CNN has reported, scrambled to figure out what to do with the two survivors before deciding  to release them to their respective home countries  — Colombia and Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  Some have wagered that this shows these two men might have been innocent; the administration, after all, has not provided public evidence for its claims that its targets are “narco-terrorists.” And some people in the relevant Latin American countries, including the  victims’ families  and  Colombian President Gustavo Petro , have called the Trump administration’s general claims about targets into question. Petro, for example, has said a Colombian killed in an earlier strike was a “fisherman” with “no ties to the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  But even if these survivors did what the administration claims, the administration’s move to release them undercuts its claims about the conflict in the Caribbean. Releasing them is very difficult to square with the argument that the US government is engaged in a war with people who would do imminent harm to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Put plainly: If these people are so dangerous and engaged in what is allegedly warfare against the United States, how could they be released?\n \n\n   \n  Trump claimed just this weekend that “ at least 25,000 Americans would die  if I allowed this submarine to come ashore.” (Trump hasn’t provided evidence for that statement, and the administration’s claims about such things  are often hyperbolic .) If these men were engaged in the attempted mass killing of Americans, how in the world does the US leave holding them accountable to other countries?\n \n\n   \n  “Dangerous enough to try to kill with military force but not dangerous enough to detain and prosecute via lawful methods …”  summarized  Harvard University law professor Jack Goldsmith, who led the George W. Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel.\n \n\n   \n  We don’t know the full details of the legal justification the administration is using, because it won’t publicly release it. But we do know that it is  effectively claiming war-like powers  to target the alleged drug vessels — despite the lack of a congressionally declared war.\n \n\n   \n  The benefit of releasing these men instead of detaining them appears to be in the legal process.\n \n\n   \n  Despite widespread concerns about the  potential illegality of the strikes , to date there doesn’t appear to have been a legal basis to challenge them in court. That could have changed if the men were detained.\n \n\n   \n  If the United States attempted to try the survivors in US civilian court, the administration would have to prove that they engaged in the activities they are accused of. That would mean the administration would actually have to pony up the evidence it has declined to publicly release.\n \n\n   \n  As The Washington Post reported in an extensive look at the situation Monday, many experts are  skeptical about the administration’s claims  that these vessels are trafficking fentanyl that could kill Americans. The area where the strikes are being carried out isn’t ordinarily used for that purpose, The Post reported, and the drugs seized there aren’t usually headed for the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also have held the survivors as wartime detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. But at that point, legal advocates could challenge the legality of their detentions by invoking the right of habeas corpus. That would have forced courts to finally reckon with whether this is really the war the Trump administration claims it is.\n \n\n   \n  The administration appears to have decided it simply doesn’t want to deal with those legal headaches — for whatever reason.\n \n\n   \n  But that, in and of itself, is extraordinary. It would seem that, to avoid a legal process, the administration has decided to leave punishing the alleged would-be mass killers of Americans to other countries. Colombia’s president, in particular, doesn’t appear to be on the same page as Trump on such matters.\n \n\n   \n  The issue hasn’t been a major point of emphasis for Congress as yet. The reasons for that appear varied. Congress is consumed by the government shutdown. Lawmakers might not want to look like they are standing up for alleged drug traffickers — just like Democrats were wary of looking like they were standing up for undocumented immigrants amid the Abrego case. And some senators who might have doubts about the strikes could be deferring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former colleague whom they confirmed 99-0 in January and has led the charge in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  But the concerns have slowly simmered. Two Senate Republicans voted to halt the boat strikes earlier this month. A bipartisan group is  looking at forcing another vote .\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana recently said he was “ highly concerned about the legality of recent strikes  in the Caribbean and the trajectory of military operations without congressional approval or debate and the support of the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican-controlled Congress basically has to be dragged into action to check Trump these days. But the events of the past week may make the administration’s actions harder to ignore.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/vaccines-city-health-officials","dateOfPublication":"1223-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:43:00-04:00","title":"City health officials urge vaccination, criticize federal government messaging","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to growing public health threats, including a measles outbreak in South Carolina and declining vaccination rates, the Big Cities Health Coalition—comprising public health leaders from major U.S. cities—has publicly urged vaccination, criticizing federal officials for politicizing vaccine policy.

12:43 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition is the latest group to take a strong public stand in support of vaccination as a direct response to concerns that the federal government is limiting access and raising doubts.\n \n\n   \n  “We are united behind a simple message: get vaccinated,” the group wrote in a  statement  that was published Monday. It was signed by two dozen public health leaders from some of the nation’s largest cities, in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination has saved millions of lives, they wrote, but falling vaccination rates across the country have led to more frequent outbreaks of devastating diseases such as measles and polio. They also referenced the “rapidly approaching” respiratory virus season, which brings a heavy wave of Covid-19 and flu infections.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply troubled by the repeated false claims about vaccines from too many federal officials, which have contributed directly to these trends,” the public health leaders wrote. “We are equally concerned about recent changes to the recommended childhood and adult immunization schedules that unnecessarily limit access to vaccines.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  voted  last month to recommend against the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children younger than 4, and a new working group will convene to more broadly assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether  the schedule should be changed .\n \n\n   \n  And at a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump made  numerous false claims  about vaccines given to children, including about the size of vaccine doses and that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot.\n \n\n   \n  As vaccination becomes increasingly politicized, city health officials say, they felt a need to speak up to protect their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make our public health decisions based on data and not on political ideology,” said Dr. Phil Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “We have to be the voices for that science and reason.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the US Department of Health and Human Services said that vaccines “can be an important tool to prevent disease, especially for the vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are restoring the doctor–patient relationship so people can make informed decisions about their health with their providers,” HHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple major medical organizations – including the  American Academy of Pediatrics  and the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  – have broken from the CDC on vaccine guidance. And new  public health organizations have formed  in recent months with an aim to safeguard public health amid turmoil at the federal level.\n \n\n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition, with members representing about a fifth of the US population, has been working together to exchange ideas and address public health threats for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  But the “threats are growing and becoming more complicated,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of public health for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina – including from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of conversation happening about how, in the absence of a strong federal public health system, we are able to navigate and ensure that we continue to protect public safety,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Consistency is important in public health, and the federal structure helped facilitate that, he said. But in the absence of that, coordination becomes key.\n \n\n   \n  A measles outbreak is growing quickly in the upstate region of South Carolina, just about 100 miles from Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have any walls to put up to keep folks from Mecklenburg going into South Carolina, or people from South Carolina going into Mecklenburg County,” Washington said. “So as a country, our local public health system is only as strong as the weakest county or jurisdiction. There is an importance of ensuring that we work collaboratively, because the boundaries that we actually exist in are only administrative.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina are in quarantine because of a  measles  exposure in school – one of the many reasons why Big Cities Health Coalition emphasizes the importance of vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccines “keep classrooms safe and schools open. They allow children to spend time with friends and enjoy their favorite activities. They help parents and caregivers work to support their families,” the organizations wrote in the new letter.\n \n\n   \n  Trust also plays a key role in public health, experts say, and city health leaders want to provide reassurance to their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “CDC has been the pinnacle of our public health science up until now. Now it seems more driven by political ideology than actual data and science, so it undermines the trust,” Huang said. “We’re all having to band together and provide that credible data- and science-driven messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  HHS argues it is restoring trust that was lost during the Biden administration’s process for approving Covid-19 vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “We are restoring that broken trust by empowering HHS’ scientists do their jobs and keeping out the conflicts of interests that plagued vaccine policymaking under Biden,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  But a recent  KFF poll  found that public trust in the CDC is the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite all the chaos and mixed messages, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the health of our communities and making sure the message is clear on the importance of vaccination,” Huang said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/prison-guard-trial-robert-brooks-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:39:00-04:00","title":"Former New York state prison guard found guilty in death of inmate beaten, 2 others acquitted","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A former New York state prison guard, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and first-degree manslaughter in the death of inmate Robert Brooks, who was beaten multiple times upon arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on December 9, 2024.

While the glow has long been attributed to pulsars or old stars, new supercomputer simulations led by Joseph Silk show that dark matter — specifically, a squashed, egg-shaped distribution — could also produce the observed glow. This matches the shape of the galactic bulge, lending new credibility to the dark matter theory.

What that means \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:28 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At the center of our galaxy, there’s a mysterious, diffuse  glow  given off by gamma rays — powerful radiation usually emitted by high-energy objects such as rapidly rotating or exploding stars.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the glow shortly after launching in 2008, and the light has puzzled scientists ever since, prompting speculation on its cause.\n \n\n   \n  Some astronomers believe the source of the glow to be pulsars — the spinning leftovers of exploded stars — while others point to colliding particles of dark matter, an elusive and invisible form of matter that is believed to be  five times  more abundant than regular matter.\n \n\n   \n   Many studies  have previously found support for  both ideas , but there seemed to be a problem with the dark matter theory: The gamma ray glow appeared to match the shape of the galactic bulge — a crowded, bulbous region at the center of the Milky Way that’s mostly made up of old stars, including pulsars. This observation seemed to support the pulsar theory, with experts theorizing that the glow would have taken a more spherical form if its source were dark matter. However, astronomers haven’t been able to observe enough of the pulsars that would be producing the gamma rays to make a conclusive assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Now, new simulations made using supercomputers show for the first time that dark matter collisions could also have created the bulge-shaped glow, adding weight to the dark matter theory.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in the situation where we have two theories, one posturing dark matter and claiming that it could explain the data we see, another one old stars,” said Joseph Silk, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of a  study  detailing the new findings, published Thursday in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a 50% chance that it might be dark matter at this point, as opposed to the slightly more mundane explanation of old stars, in my opinion.”\n \n\n   \n  Evidence of dark matter would make for a groundbreaking discovery. Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky first theorized dark matter’s existence in the 1930s, and American astronomers Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford confirmed it in the 1970s. They noticed that stars orbiting at the edge of spiral galaxies were moving too quickly to be held together by visible matter and gravity alone, and postulated that there was a large, unseen quantity of matter preventing them from flying apart. Despite decades of effort, scientists have never observed the mysterious substance directly, hence its name.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no question that the nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding major problems in physics,” Silk said. “It’s something that’s everywhere — near us, far from us, and we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Hunting for WIMPs\n \n\n   \n  There are many hypotheses on what dark matter could be, including remnants of  primordial black holes  or an undiscovered type of particle. Much of the effort to find dark matter has centered on the latter idea, leading to the construction of detectors such as the LZ Dark Matter Experiment in South Dakota.\n \n\n   \n  The instrument is designed to spot one of the  leading dark matter candidates , hypothetical particles called WIMPs —  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles — which don’t absorb light and can pass through regular matter almost seamlessly. Scientists believe that when two WIMPs meet, they annihilate each other and produce gamma rays, which would make them a plausible source of the glow.\n \n\n   \n  Silk’s study used supercomputers to create a map of where dark matter should be in the Milky Way, taking into account how the galaxy originally formed.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem was that all of the models over the past 20 years of the dark matter in our galaxy assume it’s basically like a spherical ball. There is no shape to it, because that was the simplest model,” Silk said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our contribution was, for the first time, to make a real computer simulation of the dark matter distribution. And lo and behold, we found the central part of the dark matter, where the gamma rays would be being emitted, to be, in fact, squashed — more like egg-shaped.” This squashed shape is a close match to the Fermi telescope data, Silk explained.\n \n\n   \n  Luckily, confirmation of the link between dark matter and the glow may not be too far in the offing. A new instrument, the  Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory,  or CTAO, is under construction at two sites — one in Chile and another in Spain — and will start to return data  as soon as 2027 . CTAO will detect gamma rays at a much higher resolution than Fermi, Silk said, making it possible to tell if the gamma rays at the center of the Milky Way are the product of dark matter collisions.\n \n\n   \n  That finding would be a breakthrough in the search for the elusive substance, he added, as well as offer proof that at least some dark matter is made of WIMPs. If, on the contrary, CTAO doesn’t link the glow to dark matter, scientists would be back to square one in the search, with all options still on the table.\n \n\n   \n    A fundamental secret\n \n\n   \n  The study helps reopen the possibility that dark matter could explain the glow at our galactic center, although it doesn’t give new positive evidence in favor of dark matter, said Tracy Slatyer, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with the study. However, she is not convinced that there is a definitive match between the shape of the dark matter distribution and the stellar bulge. “I thought the dark matter hypothesis was still reasonable even before this study,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  This work is further support for the international effort to keep pushing in the hunt for WIMPs, according to Chamkaur Ghag, a professor of physics and astronomy at University College London, who also didn’t participate in Silk’s research. “They remain a most elegant solution to the long-standing dark matter problem,” Ghag added via email, noting that with even more detectors for WIMPs under development, seeing signals of these particles annihilating in space would mean settling the near-century old puzzle of dark matter.\n \n\n   \n  Nico Cappelluti, an associate professor in the department of physics at the University of Miami, said that the Fermi telescope has been a game changer for NASA, and this paper shows that dark matter is still very much in the race to explain the strange glow at the center of our galaxy. “That mystery is alive, and it’s the kind that keeps scientists like me awake at night,” said Cappelluti, who didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Figuring out what dark matter is has been the scientific quest of our century, he added, noting that “WIMPs, these hypothetical particles, have been our prime suspects for years.” The fact that experiments on Earth haven’t caught them yet is frustrating, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “But Fermi gives us a reason to keep believing. This paper reminds us not to cross WIMPs off the list just yet — they might still be lighting up the center of our galaxy,” Cappelluti said. “And if that’s true, we’re closer than ever to uncovering a fundamental secret of the universe.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/suspicious-hunting-stand-trump-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00-04:00","title":"Secret Service finds ‘suspicious’ hunting stand near Air Force One landing zone in Florida","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Secret Service discovered a suspicious hunting stand located within sight of the Air Force One landing zone at Palm Beach International Airport ahead of President Donald Trump's arrival on October 20, 2025.

hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, the prominent accuser wrote in a posthumous memoir.\n \n\n   \n  “In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated – and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied,” Giuffre wrote of Epstein and his sex-trafficking ring, according to the BBC, which obtained an advance copy of the book that will be published on Tuesday. “I believed that I might die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  Six months after her  death by suicide  in Australia, Giuffre’s memoir “Nobody’s Girl” contains harrowing details of the abuse she allegedly suffered as a teenager, and her years attempting to get justice for herself and her fellow victims.\n \n\n   \n  The memoir will intensify a transatlantic scandal over the proximity of the rich and powerful to Epstein, which has claimed political scalps in Britain and for months wracked Congress in the United States. Its publication will heap fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew, the disgraced British royal accused by Giuffre of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew, who’s King Charles’ brother, vehemently denies the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Facing further public outrage over his relationship with Epstein,  Andrew  announced last week he had relinquished the use of his royal titles and would no longer be known as the  Duke of York , saying: “I have decided, as I always have, to put duty to my family and country first.” He will, however, retain the title of “prince,” since he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n \n\n   \n  While Buckingham Palace would have hoped Andrew’s decision could mark the end of a scandal that has plagued the royal family for years, the latest revelations in Giuffre’s memoir will likely deepen the prince’s disgrace.\n \n\n   \n  Among those is Giuffre’s claim that Andrew’s “team” tried to hire online “trolls” to harangue her around the time she brought a civil case against the prince in New York, according to Britain’s PA Media news agency. Giuffre alleged that, having been trafficked by Epstein, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17.\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022. Writing of that settlement, Giuffre said: “After casting doubt on my credibility for so long – Prince Andrew’s team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me – the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegation that Andrew tried to hire trolls comes after the Mail on Sunday, a British paper, reported that Andrew in 2011  asked a police officer  assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre. London’s Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” the report.\n \n\n   \n  Another damaging report found that Andrew had kept up his friendship with Epstein two months after he insisted he had broken it off. In a disastrous 2019 BBC interview, in which Andrew’s attempt to clear his name backfired spectacularly, the prince insisted he had broken off his friendship with Epstein during a walk in New York’s Central Park in December 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Newly unearthed emails have contradicted that claim. The Mail on Sunday reported that, in February 2011, a day after the British press published an image of the prince with his arm around the teenage Giuffre, Andrew wrote to Epstein: “It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/entertainment/brandy-monica-chicago-concert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-05:00","title":"Brandy explains why she left Monica all alone on stage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brandy apologized for abruptly leaving the stage during a Chicago show of the 'The Boy Is Mine' joint tour with Monica, citing dehydration and health concerns.

Why does this keep happening? \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:28 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Amazon Web Services  (AWS), the cloud computing platform that powers much of the internet, went down for several hours Monday, making several major   websites and apps inoperable.\n \n\n   \n  From banking services to social networks to airline booking sites to online shopping, thousands of services were disrupted as millions of people worldwide – many of whom were on their way to work on the US East Coast – were unable to mobile-order coffee or access key apps.\n \n\n   \n  The latest outage serves as a reminder of how fragile the internet’s backbone can be, even if the disruption is brief, and how reliant the world has become on these online services.\n \n\n   \n  Although AWS and its competitors are generally robust, the internet is a complex web of overlapping services that are only as reliable as their weakest code. The root cause of Monday’s outage remains unknown, but a service that converts friendly web names into IP addresses was unable to communicate with thousands of companies’ massive databases hosted by Amazon.\n \n\n   \n  Past outages on this scale have been caused by a wide variety of errors, including faulty updates, the accidental injection of bad code, or a change to third-party software that doesn’t play nicely with a service. Rarely, internet cable cuts, cyberattacks or direct denial of service attacks can bring down or overload servers that host key apps.\n \n\n   \n  But the relative frequency of these events shows the lack of necessary redundancies and competitive services. Too often, some internet experts say, companies put all their eggs in one cloud services basket.\n \n\n   \n  There’s “no sign” that this was a cyberattack, according to Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity firm NymVPN, adding that it “looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon’s main data centers.”\n \n\n   \n  “The internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient, yet today so much of our online ecosystem is concentrated in a small number of cloud regions,” he said in a note. “When one of those regions experiences a fault, the impact is immediate and widespread.”\n \n\n   \n  Jardin said “these issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down; and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  AWS doesn’t often experience major disruptions like this, with the last  one occurring in 2021 .\n \n\n   \n  “That’s on par with the other major cloud providers and, in fact, it’s amazing that they’re able to run at the scale they do without more frequent disruptions,” said Mike Chapple, a cybersecurity expert and IT professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason these events attract much more notice is because of their impact,” he told CNN. “If a single company experiences an issue in their data center, it causes issues for that company’s products and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the  largest-ever IT outage  brought down large portions of the internet when a devastating CrowdStrike software glitch crashed computers, led to flight cancellations and disrupted hospitals around the globe, creating $5 billion in direct business losses. A bug in CrowdStrike’s cloud-based testing system pushed a problematic update to computers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Also last year,  AT&T’s network went down several times , including an 11-hour meltdown that prevented many gig workers from doing their jobs.\n \n\n   \n    So, what went wrong Monday?\n \n\n   \n  AWS is a cloud computing provider that hosts many of the world’s most-used online services. In Amazon’s infancy, the company needed excess server capacity to ensure it had enough computing power to handle the massive amounts of traffic that came to its site during the holiday season rush. Amazon realized that during the rest of the year, it could use those servers to support other companies’ online needs, and out of that AWS was born.\n \n\n   \n  Among AWS’ many offerings is DynamoDB, a database that hosts information for companies, including customer data. Amazon said Monday that its customers couldn’t access the data stored in DynamoDB, because the Domain Name System (DNS) – a kind of phone book for the internet – had encountered a problem.\n \n\n   \n  DNS is like an internet location engine, converting user-friendly web addresses like amazon.com into IP addresses – a series of numbers that other websites and applications can understand.\n \n\n   \n  “Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” said Chapple. “It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what caused the DNS outage, but it lasted only a few hours. By 6:35 am ET, Amazon had fixed the DNS problem and recommended companies dump their cache – temporary storage files – to help speed up the restoration of their services.\n \n\n   \n  Amazon said the outage continued to affect other AWS services, including EC2 – a kind of virtual server many companies use to build their online applications.\n \n\n   \n  The company will likely conduct a postmortem and explain what went wrong with its DNS system in the coming days.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/07/politics/tariff-revenue-federal-food-aid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"White House says it will use tariff revenue to fund federal food aid for mothers and young children","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration announced it would redirect Section 32 tariff revenue — typically used for child nutrition — to fund the WIC program during the government shutdown, avoiding a complete halt for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children.

\nUpdated: \n        10:17 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Editor’s Note: The Trump administration has clarified that it will use Section 32 tariff revenue, which typically supports child nutrition programs, to extend funding for WIC during the shutdown — instead of using Section 232 revenue as initially announced. \n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration said Tuesday it will use tariff funds to keep afloat a federal food assistance program for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children during the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The program, known as WIC, was expected  to run out of money soon  because Congress has yet to approve a federal spending package for fiscal year 2026, which started on October 1. The National WIC Association has predicted that the program’s funding would last only a week or two into the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the tariff idea in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are so cruel in their continual votes to shut down the government that they forced the WIC program for the most vulnerable women and children to run out this week,” she wrote. “Thankfully, President Trump and the White House have identified a creative solution to transfer resources from Section 232 tariff revenue to this critical program.”\n \n\n   \n  The tariff money  goes into a general fund  managed by the Treasury Department. But the fund and all the tariff revenue flowing into it is essentially frozen until a bill is passed to fund the government. Congress and Trump could get around that by passing a measure designating the tariff revenue for a specific use.\n \n\n   \n  While the National WIC Association said it welcomes any effort to keep the program operational during the shutdown, it said critical details remain unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “Families need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty,” Georgia Machell, the association’s CEO, said in a statement Tuesday. “We still don’t know how much funding this measure provides, how quickly states will receive it, or how long it will sustain operations.”\n \n\n   \n  At least one budget expert questioned the legality of the Trump administration directing tariff funds to WIC. Lawmakers have not appropriated federal funds to be spent on the program, just as they haven’t for the rest of the discretionary federal budget, Chris Towner, policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem isn’t that they don’t have the money — it’s that Congress hasn’t told them they can spend it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the administration’s authority, a White House spokesperson directed CNN to Leavitt’s post on X.\n \n\n   \n    Bipartisan support\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which has long had bipartisan support, has emerged as a talking point among Republicans on how the shutdown is hurting Americans.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson previously called his Democratic colleagues “shameful” and blamed them for how the government shutdown has impacted WIC.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’ve done by shutting the government down is they have stopped the WIC program,” Johnson said in an interview last week on Newsmax, also citing other programs affected by the impasse.\n \n\n   \n  “All those programs are going to stop. They have stopped now because Chuck Schumer decided to play politics for selfish reasons,” he said, referring to the Senate minority leader. “It’s really shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  Axios first  reported  the White House effort.\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of Donald Trump’s second term, the president has been adding and increasing tariffs on a wide swath of products and countries, which he argues will spur more manufacturing in the US and bolster national security. Tariff collections have totaled  $190 billion  so far this year.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs are imposed on national security grounds. Trump has already levied such tariffs on aluminum, steel and cars, for example.\n \n\n   \n    Funding lapse\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture told state agencies last week that due to the lapse in government funding, they will not receive their quarterly allocation of fiscal year 2026 money for WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.\n \n\n   \n  However, the department said it intends to allocate up to $150 million in contingency funds to state WIC agencies suffering from shortfalls. Also, states can use rebates from infant formula manufacturers, as well as their own funds, according to the USDA guidance obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  WIC helps enrollees purchase infant formula, baby food, cheese, yogurt, bread, peanut butter, fruits, vegetables and other staples, and it provides breastfeeding and nutrition support.\n \n\n   \n  Participation has increased in recent years as federal and state policymakers made it easier to enroll and recertify, improved the shopping experience, and enhanced the benefits. Also, rising inflation,  particularly for food , in recent years has squeezed the budgets of many Americans, especially low-income families.\n \n\n   \n    More federal support needed\n \n\n   \n  Even after the shutdown ends, advocates are concerned about WIC having sufficient funding for the coming fiscal year. Unlike food stamps, federal support for WIC is capped — though Congress has always allocated enough money to provide for all participants.\n \n\n   \n  The program received $7.6 billion in funding for fiscal year 2025, which ended September 30. The pending full-year spending bill in the House would keep funding flat and reduce WIC’s fruit and vegetable benefit, while the version approved by the Senate would provide $8.2 billion for this fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates stress more money is needed this fiscal year to ensure no one is turned away and benefits don’t get cut. Enrollment stood at just under 6.9 million people in May, the most recent month available, up nearly 126,000 from a year earlier and nearly 193,000 from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-test-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:49:00-04:00","title":"US-brokered ceasefire appears to survive first major test as Israel and Hamas affirm commitment to deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza appears to have withstood its first major test after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 44 people in response to claims that Hamas attacked Israeli forces, killing two soldiers—Major Yaniv Kula and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz.

first major test as Israel and Hamas affirm commitment to deal \n       \n  By Tal Shalev, Mostafa Salem, Oren Liebermann, Mitchell McCluskey, and Ibrahim Dahman\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:49 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A US-brokered  ceasefire  in Gaza appears to have survived its first major test as Israel and Hamas affirmed their commitment to the deal after two Israeli soldiers were killed in the enclave on Sunday, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it would begin a “renewed enforcement” of the ceasefire at the direction of the political echelon.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and its military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades (AQB), said on Sunday morning that they remain committed to the ceasefire and rejected involvement in the attack on Israeli forces.\n \n\n   \n  The stated commitment to the ceasefire comes as the deal’s  key architects , Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, arrived in the region in an effort to push forward the next phase of the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (PMO) said he met with them Monday, on the eve of a visit by US Vice President JD Vance.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration remains focused on implementing the peace agreement and we are working vigorously with our partners to do so. We’re not going to detail ongoing private diplomatic conversations,” a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Sunday, Israel carried out a series of strikes across Gaza after it accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers – Major Yaniv Kula, 26, and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz – marking the first time Israeli troops have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli strikes killed at least 44 people in several parts of Gaza on Sunday, according to data from Gaza’s hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hamas and the IDF blamed the other for violating the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Scenes of panic emerged in Gaza during the strikes, where crowds were seen gathered at al-Aqsa hospital as casualties were rushed into the facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We were sitting in a cafeteria, drinking tea and coffee, and suddenly we heard the news — they were hit and bombed, and everyone was killed. That’s all that happened,” Sallih Salman, the brother of one of the deceased Palestinians, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the renewed strikes, the AQB said it found the body of another Israeli hostage during ongoing search operations, “and will hand it over today if field conditions permit.”\n \n\n   \n  The AQB warned that any escalation by the Israeli military would “hinder search, excavation, and the recovery of bodies.”\n \n\n   \n    Aid deliveries continue\n \n\n   \n  Deliveries of aid into Gaza will continue on Monday after Israel announced they would be halted on Sunday, a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The quick announcement of the continuation of aid – only hours after the declared pause – means the deliveries of humanitarian aid may not have been affected.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s continuation of aid is an indication of the goal of maintaining key components of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Hamas. But the Rafah Crossing will remain closed, the official said, as Israel awaits the return of the remaining hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, a UN-backed initiative said parts of Gaza  were facing famine  and the truce raised hopes of a surge in humanitarian aid to the territory.\n \n\n   \n  But Netanyahu faces pressure to respond to any violations from far-right parties supporting his coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, described the resumption of aid as a “shameful backdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “All this on a day when Hamas murdered two IDF soldiers, and continues to violate the agreement and refuses to hand over all the bodies of our fallen,” he  wrote  on X, “Enough of the backdowns.”\n \n\n   \n    Clashes in Rafah\n \n\n   \n  Israel had carried out strikes in Gaza on Sunday after an Israeli military official said Hamas attacked Israeli forces in Rafah in southern Gaza with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas fired towards Israeli forces beyond the Yellow Line – the line behind which Israeli troops have withdrawn according to the ceasefire deal – in three separate incidents on Sunday, according to another military official.\n \n\n   \n  The AQB denied knowledge of “any events or clashes” in Rafah and said they are committed to the truce “throughout all areas of the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  While much is unknown about the incident Rafah, it occurred on Sunday morning as Hamas said its internal Rada’a security force was targeting a “hideout” of an Israel-backed militia led by  Yasser Abu Shabab . In June, Israel confirmed it was arming several such militias in an attempt to counter Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said these militias now operate from within Israeli-occupied areas in Gaza from which they “descend on the other half of Gaza, carry out attacks, then go run back to those protected areas.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the ceasefire began last week, Hamas has carried out what it has called a “security campaign” aimed at “collaborators, mercenaries, thieves, bandits, and those cooperating with the Zionist enemy throughout the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal clashes have created a volatile security situation in the battered enclave with violence erupting between Hamas and rival groups in several areas across Gaza, including an incident that culminated in an apparent public execution of eight people in a square in Gaza City while large crowds were watching.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s incident brought further strain to the ceasefire, with the next steps still unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has shot and killed Palestinians it accused of approaching the Yellow Line, in what Hamas has called a “flagrant violation” of the ceasefire commitments. Israel has also accused Hamas of delaying the return of all of the deceased hostages held in Gaza as required by the deal, and has closed a key border crossing until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages in line with the ceasefire agreement with Israel. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information and context. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dana Karni, Alayna Treene, Sophie Tanno, and Abeer Salman contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/drug-users-guns-owning-supreme-courts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:48:00-04:00","title":"Justices Agree to Review Federal Law Banning Drug Users from Possessing Guns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that prohibits certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual US-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a firearm along with marijuana and cocaine.

John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:48 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide if the federal government may bar certain drug users from owning guns or if the law violates the Second Amendment, taking up a second significant guns case of its current term.\n \n\n   \n  The appeal represents a rare circumstance in which the Trump administration is defending a gun prohibition, which it described in briefing at the Supreme Court as a “narrow” limitation on one of “Americans’ most cherished freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the United States and Pakistan, who was indicted in 2023 on a single count of violating the guns-and-drugs law after the FBI found a 9mm pistol, 60 grams of marijuana, and 4.7 grams of cocaine at his family home. This prosecution, the government told the high court, rested Hemani’s habitual use of marijuana.\n \n\n   \n  The court will likely hear arguments in the Hemani case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.\n \n\n   \n  A federal district court dismissed the charge, noting a landmark decision from the Supreme Court in 2022 that made it easier for Americans to carry handguns in public and also required similar gun prohibitions to have a connection to history.\n \n\n   \n  But just how closely analogous prosecutors must come to a historic law has been a matter of debate. Last year, for instance, the  Supreme Court upheld a federal law  that bars guns for Americans who are the subject of certain domestic abuse restraining orders, rejecting an argument pressed by gun rights groups that the prohibition violated the Second Amendment.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision, holding in a brief decision that the historical record points only to laws that barred guns for Americans who are actively intoxicated or under the influence of drugs at the time of their arrest. The government, the court ruled, could not target habitual users.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration appealed that decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Habitual illegal drug users with firearms present unique dangers to society – especially because they pose a grave risk of armed, hostile encounters with police officers while impaired,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration laid out a series of allegations against Hemani in its appeal, claiming a search of his phone at the border in 2019 revealed he was prepared to commit fraud at the direction of affiliates of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The government also claimed Hemani traveled to Iran to participate in a celebration of the life of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian official killed in a US drone strike in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  In his response, Hemani argued that the historical support for the federal law is “tenuous at best.” And his attorneys noted that nearly half of US states have legalized recreational marijuana.\n \n\n   \n  “While the number of Americans who use marijuana legally under state law and possess a firearm is unknown, there is certainly a significant overlap between the two,” he argued.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was  convicted in 2024 of the same law  at issue in the Hemani case. He was later  pardoned by Biden  during his final days in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court also agreed to hear a case questioning whether states may bar people from carrying guns on private property – like malls and retail stores – without  permission from the property owner .\n \n\n   \n   This story is breaking and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/louvre-heist-which-jewels-stolen-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-04:00","title":"Historic jewels stolen in ‘national disaster’ for France: What we know about missing Louvre treasures","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 20, 2025, four thieves carried out a seven-minute heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, targeting the Apollo Gallery, which houses the French Crown Jewels.

missing Louvre treasures \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Precious artifacts  snatched from Paris’s Louvre Museum  Sunday include an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife and other treasures of “inestimable” value.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves targeted the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery on the upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels. In the course of a brisk seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France’s culture ministry.  The thieves left on motorcycles, police said. \n \n\n   \n  One item, an ornate gold crown worn by Empress Eugénie, during her reign in the 1800s, was recovered near the scene, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Art recovery expert Arthur Brand said the thieves stole important pieces of history in what was a “national disaster” for France.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the crown jewels from Napoleon, his wife and his successors. So these are the natural pride of France,” Brand told CNN. “It’s a great loss.” Because the pieces are so recognizable, he said the thieves will likely dismantle them, sell the jewels and melt down the gold and silver.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what was stolen:\n \n\n   \n    A sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring worn by several queens\n \n\n   \n  This diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland; Marie-Amélie, Queen of the French; and Isabelle d’Orléans, Duchess of Guise is among the items snatched by four thieves during the  7-minute heist. \n \n\n   \n  The diadem — a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty — features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  The origins of the set are unknown, though some suggest it once belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette. While the jewelry bears no hallmarks of the most famous French jewelers of the era, it is indicative of the craftmanship of Parisian artisans of the early 19th century, the museum said. The set stayed with the Orléans family until 1985, when it was acquired by the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n    An emerald necklace and earrings gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise\n \n\n   \n  A wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, this ornate set was crafted by the jeweler François-Régnault Nitot includes 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  After Napoleon’s empire collapsed, Marie-Louise bequeathed the original set, which also included a tiara, to a relative, and it was passed through generations of her descendants.\n \n\n   \n  In 1953, the set was sold to jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, after which the emeralds of the tiara were sold and later replaced with turquoise stones by an American collector. The altered tiara is now a part of the Smithsonian collection.\n \n\n   \n  The necklace and earrings, however, were preserved in their original form and sold to the Louvre in 2004 for a reported 3.7 million euros ($4.3 million).\n \n\n   \n    The reliquary brooch\n \n\n   \n  Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the original owner of this  diamond-encrusted brooch,  which was crafted by Paul-Alfred Bapst in 1855 specially for her, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  A Spanish countess, Eugénie was Empress of the French from 1853-1870 and considered one of the most fashionable women of the time.\n \n\n   \n  A reliquary brooch is a brooch that holds a sacred relic, a symbol of Eugénie’s Catholic faith. Comprised of 94 diamonds, the brooch includes the 17th and 18th Mazarin diamonds, which were given to King Louis XIV by former chief minister Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, according to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  These large stones mirror each other at the center of the brooch. Beautiful engravings of foliage and leaves decorate the back of the golden brooch, which was acquired by the Louvre in 1887.\n \n\n   \n    A diamond bow brooch and diadem of Empress Eugénie\n \n\n   \n  The  silver, gold and diamond bow brooch  originally formed the buckle of a diamond belt of 4,000 stones which was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, before it was worn by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Eugénie is said to have worn the belt, crafted by François Kramer, during a visit by Queen Victoria to the Palace of Versailles in August 1855, and again in June 1856 for the baptism of the Prince Imperial. Eugénie later decided to transform the belt into a brooch and had one of her own jewelers fashion it into a more elaborate standalone piece, adding cascading diamond tassels.\n \n\n   \n  In 1887, the brooch was purchased by jeweler Emile Schlesinger for New York socialite Caroline Astor at auction for 42,200 French francs, according to auction house Christie’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brooch remained in the Astor family for more than a century until the Louvre bought it in 2008, returning the brooch to France. The museum paid 6.72 million euros (more than $10 million at the time) for the brooch,  according to the Fondation  Napoleon . \n \n\n   \n  The pearl diadem was made for Eugénie by jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier in 1853 and contains 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds,  according to the Louvre. \n \n\n   \n    Stolen but recovered: Eugénie’s crown\n \n\n   \n  Thieves attempted to steal Empress Eugénie’s crown, but it was found outside the Louvre, according to France’s culture ministry,\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/cowboys-fashion-politics-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"Why Are Cowboys Everywhere?

While the cowboy has long been a romanticized symbol tied to patriotism and rugged individualism—popularized by 19th-century shows and Hollywood films—its current ubiquity in media, politics, and advertising reflects deeper cultural anxieties. The trend is especially linked to conservative leaders like Donald Trump and George W. Bush, who use cowboy aesthetics to signal traditional values and a rejection of urban liberalism. However, the article highlights that this image is a mythologized construct, ignoring the historical reality that cowboys were predominantly Mexican, Native American, or enslaved Black Americans. Recent efforts by Black artists and communities, such as Beyoncé’s 'Cowboy Carter' and Gabriela Hasbun’s photography, are beginning to correct this imbalance. Despite this, mainstream narratives continue to whitewash the cowboy's diverse roots, emphasizing only the romantic, heroic aspects while omitting poverty, labor, and systemic inequity. The article concludes that while the cowboy trend is a powerful cultural symbol, it is ultimately a commercial and political construct rather than an accurate reflection of American history.","keyTakeAways":["The cowboy image is a cultural myth, not a reflection of historical reality, rooted in 19th-century entertainment and romanticized portrayals.","The current surge in cowboy

But today’s prevailing cowboy image also highlights how cultural myths are continuously upcycled and resold, regardless of their origins.\n \n\n   \n  Cowboy-inspired fashion graced October’s issue of Vogue, which featured cover stars  Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid on horses  at a Wyoming ranch. Beyoncé’s  “Cowboy Carter” tour  had thousands two-stepping in their country best. The longstanding Western drama “Yellowstone,” its spinoff “1923” and the Billy Bob Thornton-led “Landman” are among some of the  most-watched TV series . And a wide range of brands including  fast-casual restaurant Sweetgreen  and luxury outerwear brand  Canada Goose  have embraced cowboy hats and rusted-red canyon backdrops in ad campaigns.\n \n\n   \n  “This idea of American patriotism ties into this identity,” said Melynda Seaton, art historian at East Texas A&M University. “And I think now, we’re seeing it more.”\n \n\n   \n    Our ideas about cowboys are divorced from reality\n \n\n   \n  Our collective interest in cowboys can be traced to at least the 1880s, when the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows — a theatrical vaudeville traveling performance — brought romantic and entertaining notions of the West and cowboys to the collective popular culture. Since then, those tropes, popularized by Western films, have reappeared in cycles, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  Singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Western actor John Wayne became synonymous with patriotism, further forging the link between cowboys and American identity. That these connections were cemented during McCarthyism and the Red Scare — a time when the American way was perceived to be under threat — is no accident, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  “We started isolating this idea of the cowboy being the epitome of American values,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But pop culture’s depiction of cowboys and the American West is selective.  In ad campaigns, television shows, and even in political discourse, the myth of the cowboy is inherently good, inherently brave, inherently tied to the (American) land. The less glamorous side — the poop shoveled, the low wages — is rarely shown.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things that nobody ever talks about is they only film in the summer for (‘Yellowstone’), because the climate is way too harsh to film in the winter,” Seaton said. “So there’s this weird, only showing the good parts of cowboy culture, but not the bad parts.”\n \n\n   \n  Fashion photographer Richard Avedon exhibited a famous series of portraits from the American West in 1985, having traveled through 17 states and nearly 200 towns  from Texas to Idaho . His portraits poked a hole into the romantic mythology of the American West, telling instead a story of poverty and struggle. A North Dakotan farmer with one arm stares at the camera. A 9-year-old boy in Montana cradles a rifle. A Nebraskan slaughterhouse worker’s white uniform is dyed dark with blood.\n \n\n   \n  The  New York Times  “ripped the exhibition apart,” Seaton said, and many city-dwellers bristled at the harshness of the photos.\n \n\n   \n  Avedon’s portraits are a grim contrast from what we see in old Western films or the fashion and ad campaigns and TV shows of today. The spectacle of the cowboy is so devolved from the actual work of the West, Seaton said, that they exist almost as two separate entities. It is not the actual cowboy that we are interested in; instead, it’s the cowboy costume we have come to mythologize.\n \n\n   \n    Cowboys and the conservative swing\n \n\n   \n  The last time Keegin recalls this level of cowboy costuming was the late 1990s, toward the end of the Clinton administration. “PC culture” was being vilified, she said, and George W. Bush’s Texan twang and plainspoken nature appealed to many.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, there was a pushback against urban-ness and all it has come to represent, Keegin said — liberal values, “elites,” academia, all points still contested today. The cowboy costume’s appeal is in its opposition to that image. As the cowboy image has come to take on these meanings, Republicans’ use of it to gain political favor is  well-documented .\n \n\n   \n  “When we decide that there is ‘real America,’ we tend to buy cowboy hats,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, this rise in cowboy imagery can be attributed in part to the current wave of cultural conservatism, exhibited not just by the Trump administration but by resurging interest in  traditional gender roles  and  conservative social media stars . That resurgence is mirrored in our cultural imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “We are influenced by the politics around us, even if we don’t agree with those politics,” Keegin said. “The aesthetics of those politics influence our choices.”\n \n\n   \n  Arizona native Ben Christensen is a creative director whose work highlights the American West. A recent ad for Zara featured his daughter and her friends dancing in cowboy boots and hats backdropped against the Arizona desert, and he’s brought his signature Western vibe to other campaigns and brands, too. As the cowboy image has become more ubiquitous, Christensen said more companies are capitalizing on its trendiness. Today, the cowboy represents traditional American values, Christensen said: honest, hard working, God-loving and respectful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very old school, but it’s very refreshing,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Politicians toy with those associations in their own cowboy costuming. Trump, who grew a reputation among some as a  “champion of the common man,”  does not explicitly present himself as a cowboy in the way of Bush or Ronald Reagan. (The latter specifically wore a cowboy hat in campaign materials despite only playing a cowboy on TV.) Yet, historians have noted that his rhetoric and policies play into the individualist and patriotic characteristics associated with the beloved Western cowboy.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration has taken cowboy individualism now to an extreme, I believe, gutting the US government and centering power in a dominant president, while also pulling the United States out of the web of international organizations that have stabilized the globe since World War II,” said historian Heather Cox Richardson during a public lecture at the University of British Columbia  earlier this year .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s investment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol — the latter of which has reignited its  recruitment presence at rodeos  — can also be seen as a product of this overarching cowboy imagery, which “feeds a conviction that true men dominate situations, both at home and abroad, with violence,”  Richardson wrote . Just as Hollywood cowboys once defended the American frontier, real ones can now do the same at the American border.\n \n\n   \n    A white-washing in real time\n \n\n   \n  The popular image of the cowboy is not one rooted in the actual history of cowboys — who were originally  Mexican, Native  or  enslaved Black Americans  — but rather in myths perpetuated by entertainment. Yet the role people of color have played in the American West is one that has only recently been highlighted and celebrated.\n \n\n   \n  Black horseback riders during the 2020 George Floyd protests ignited a national dialogue around Black urban cowboys that continued through  heavy media coverage  and, later, photography books and  exhibitions . Beyoncé’s 2024 country album “Cowboy Carter” and the ensuing tour was an albeit  imperfect  education in Black rodeo and country culture. And just two months before the release of “Cowboy Carter,” Louis Vuitton creative director Pharrell Williams  showcased dozens of looks  during Paris Fashion Week inspired by the diversity of the American frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Gabriela Hasbun is the photographer behind “The New Black West,” a book of photography that highlights modern Black cowboys and the Black rodeo, showcasing the current, active role Black Americans play in stewarding cowboy culture. Hasbun has covered the Bill Pickett Rodeo in Oakland, California, since 2007, and she remembers the days when the audience in the stands was sparse, primarily locals and rodeo people there to support the community. Fast forward to 2022, she said, and the rodeo was completely sold out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a very hardworking community that puts a lot of effort in making this rodeo happen,” Hasbun said. “They’ve been doing it since 1984, and only until recently have they been applauded.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the images and political messages being pushed in 2025 continue to rely on earlier stereotypes of the Western cowboy. Urban cowboy culture and the diversity of the West has never been more known, yet its visibility has been a blip.\n \n\n   \n  “Yet again, we’re seeing a trend be ushered into the zeitgeist by Black Americans and then whitewashed a few years later,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t concern Kirk Bailey, president of the Oakland Black Cowboy Association, who has seen the interest in cowboys and horseback riding balloon since 2019. The more people learn about cowboy culture and the diversity within it, he said, the more interested they’ll be.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s a trend that’s going to die off anytime soon,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Perpetuated by popular media and politicians alike, the cowboy costume’s current ubiquity is evidence of the image’s grip on the American imagination. While not always a reflection of the true history of real cowboys, its cyclical commercialization is, in its own right, an American tradition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/harper-lee-short-stories-published-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:11:00-04:00","title":"Harper Lee’s Newly Discovered Short Stories Set to Be Published","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Harper Lee’s long-overlooked short stories, discovered in her New York apartment after her death, are set to be published in a new collection titled 'The Land of Sweet Forever'.

Here, finally, was a chance to discover how Lee’s distinctive voice was honed in the years before she wrote “To Kill a Mockingbird.”\n \n\n   \n  These short stories will be published for the first time on Tuesday, in a collection titled “ The Land of Sweet Forever ,” accompanied by an introduction by Casey Cep, Lee’s biographer.\n \n\n   \n  After dropping out of law school a semester away from completing her degree, Lee moved to New York City to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a writer.\n \n\n   \n  It was during this time that she wrote these stories — some containing kernels of the ideas she fully expresses in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” others depicting life navigating New York, according to an  article  Cep published in the Guardian on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “I knew there were unpublished stories, I had no idea where the manuscripts of those stories were,” Lee’s nephew, Edwin Lee Conner,  told the BBC .\n \n\n   \n  Conner and his cousin Molly Lee both remember their aunt as a “great storyteller” who would regale them with made-up stories inspired by British author Daphne du Maurier.\n \n\n   \n  “The stories that she told me, she would make them up but they all seemed to be based around, ‘It was a dark and stormy night’… It seemed to me they were always on the moor and she would just take me into the dark,” Molly Lee told the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  And in this collection, they both see their aunt still finding her voice as a writer, albeit with glimpses of her potential.\n \n\n   \n  Conner describes these stories as “apprentice stories,” which aren’t the “fullest expression of her genius — and yet there’s genius in them.”\n \n\n   \n  Alongside these early sketches of stories, the collection also contains eight essays Lee wrote after she published “To Kill a Mockingbird,” offering insight into a writer both before and after she completed the work that defined her career.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/diwali-festival-of-lights-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:59:00-04:00","title":"It’s Diwali, a time for light, community and fresh starts","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major cultural and religious festival celebrated by over a billion people across India, Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji, and other South Asian diaspora communities.

It’s Diwali, a time for light, community and fresh starts \n       \n  By Harmeet Kaur, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:59 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More than a billion Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists around the world are celebrating  Diwali , the festival of lights, on October 20, 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Diwali, also called Deepavali, is one of the  biggest festivals in India . It’s also widely celebrated in Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji and other countries with large South Asian diasporas. Homes, businesses and public spaces are lit up with diyas, or oil lamps made from clay, and fireworks displays abound. People gather with their families, eat sweets and exchange gifts.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its deep religious significance, Diwali today is also a  cultural festival observed by people regardless of faith .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the holiday.\n \n\n   \n    What is Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali comes from the Sanskrit word deepavali, meaning “row of lights.”\n \n\n   \n  It marks the triumph of light over darkness, of good over evil. Though Diwali traditions vary according to region and religion, the myths and historical stories behind the holiday share themes of justice and liberation.\n \n\n   \n    When is Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali is celebrated every year in autumn, usually falling between October and November. The festival lasts five days, with the main celebration occurring on the third day. This year, Diwali will be observed on October 20.\n \n\n   \n  These are the  five days of Diwali :\n \n\n   \n  •  Dhanteras : People typically mark the first day of Diwali by purchasing gold and silver jewelry, utensils and other new household items for good luck. Many clean their homes to invite the blessings of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Others also honor  Dhanvantari , the god of Ayurveda, and Yamaraj, the god of death, on this day.\n \n\n   \n  •  Choti Diwali , or  Naraka Chaturdashi : The second day of Diwali marks Lord Krishna’s  defeat of the demon king Narakasura . People wake up early to bathe and wash their hair. They also clean their homes, decorate them with rangolis and diyas and prepare sweets.\n \n\n   \n  •  Diwali,  or  Lakshmi Puja : The third day of the festival is what people typically think of as  Diwali . Families gather to exchange gifts, feast on scrumptious dishes and indulge in sweets. Many Hindus worship the goddess Lakshmi on this day.\n \n\n   \n  •  Padwa , or  Govardhan Puja : The fourth day of Diwali honors the relationship between husband and wife, and husbands will typically buy a gift for their spouses. In some traditions, it commemorates the day Lord Krishna lifted  Govardhan Hill  to protect villagers of Vrindavan from rains brought on by Lord Indra’s anger. Some devotees offer a mountain of food to Krishna in remembrance, while others make clay and cow dung figures recreating the event.\n \n\n   \n  •  Bhai Dooj : The final day of Diwali celebrates  the love between siblings , in honor of the bond between Lord Yama and his sister Yami (or Yamuna). Sisters will sometimes place a tilak, or red mark, on their brothers’ foreheads, while brothers will give gifts to their sisters.\n \n\n   \n    What is the meaning of Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali is largely observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists, but much like Christmas, the holiday transcends religion and is now celebrated by many people outside those traditions.\n \n\n   \n  The meaning of the festival varies by community and region.\n \n\n   \n  One of the legends at the heart of Diwali comes from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. During the exile of Prince Rama (an incarnation of the god Vishnu) and his wife Sita (an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi), Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana. Rama ultimately defeats Ravana to rescue his wife. For some Hindus, Diwali marks Rama and Sita’s triumphant  return to their kingdom after 14 years of exile .\n \n\n   \n  Some Hindus in southern India celebrate Lord Krishna’s defeat of Narakasura, which led to the rescue of  16,000 girls  in the demon’s captivity. In western India, Diwali  commemorates the day  that Lord Vishnu banishes the demon king Bali to rule the netherworld.\n \n\n   \n  Sikhs commemorate the occasion as “ Bandi Chhor Divas ” (The Day of Liberation), which will be observed on October 21 this year.   It marks the day that Guru Hargobind, their sixth guru, and 52 Hindu kings were  freed from wrongful imprisonment . The Mughal Emperor Jahangir initially only agreed to release Guru Hargobind, but the guru refused to go without the royals. After Jahangir declared that those who could hold onto the guru’s cloak could leave, Guru Hargobind tied 52 tassels to his cloak so that each ruler could walk to freedom.\n \n\n   \n  For Jains, Diwali signifies the day  Lord Mahavira , their last spiritual leader, attained physical death and achieved enlightenment. Some Buddhists acknowledge Diwali as the day the  Emperor Ashoka  embraced Buddhism.\n \n\n   \n    How is Diwali celebrated?\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the common traditions of decorating one’s home, setting off firecrackers and feasting on delicious food, there are several other ways that people mark Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  In some parts of India, people play gambling card games such as teen patti, blackjack and poker. Gambling during the holiday is considered auspicious, stemming from a legend in which the  god Shiva and his consort Parvati play a dice game .\n \n\n   \n  Diwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year, and many businesses, traders and shopkeepers open new accounts books during the holiday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/asia/japan-bear-attack-survivor-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"04:28:00-04:00","title":"Runner wrestles bear in the Japanese woods: ‘In one bite my arm was done’","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Billy Halloran, a 32-year-old runner from Auckland, New Zealand, was attacked by two Asiatic black bears while running in the woods near Myoko, Japan.

he goes there for regular walks, runs, and even raced an ultramarathon through its rugged wilderness. But two weeks ago, he was running for his life in the same woods – after being attacked by a bear.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran was on one of his routine runs in early October when he saw something he’d never encountered before: two Asiatic black bears.\n \n\n   \n  He   immediately knew he was in trouble. Bear attacks have been  rising across Japan,  with more than 100 people injured so far this year and at least seven killed, the highest since records began in 2006. One recent deadly attack took place just a few miles from where he lives.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he was alone on the trail, kilometers away from where he’d parked his car, contemplating how to escape the two bears staring at him from bushes less than 30 meters away.\n \n\n   \n  When he tried backing away slowly, one bear began moving toward him, said the 32-year-old originally from Auckland, New Zealand. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran decided not to run, afraid it would chase and jump onto him from behind. So instead, he tried to scare it off by shouting. “I could see it was going to lunge at me – and it did.”\n \n\n   \n  He held up his arm in front of his face, “and it grabbed my arm, and I got pushed to the ground,” Halloran said.\n \n\n   \n  “Then in one bite, my arm was done.”\n \n\n   \n  The bear then attacked his leg, leaving claw punctures and scratches, before it backed off. Running on adrenaline, Halloran managed to get up, then engaged in a brief “standoff” with the bear – before it disappeared back into the bush.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified it might come back, Halloran called his wife to come and pick him up. With a broken arm and badly injured leg, he managed to run a kilometer to meet her and wait for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  He spoke to CNN from the hospital where he’s been recovering for the past two weeks, having had three surgeries – including a hip graft to cover a chunk of bone that had been bitten off, and the insertion of metal plates into his arm.\n \n\n   \n  A long road of recovery still awaits, including physical rehabilitation. After his last ultramarathon, he’d been hoping to train for more races – and still plans to – but knows it won’t be the same as before.\n \n\n   \n  A bigger challenge might be facing the lingering trauma of the attack, which he compared to “how someone getting attacked by a shark might feel like trying to go back surfing.”\n \n\n   \n  But he’s determined to get back to running in the woods, crediting the local community of runners that have supported him throughout his recovery. And he feels fortunate, he said, because “there’s been a lot of attacks, and some people haven’t been so lucky.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, other bear incidents have included bears rampaging through a supermarket, loitering outside a nursery, and severely mutilating a man while he was cleaning an outdoor bath.\n \n\n   \n   Experts say bears  are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.\n \n\n   \n  In response to this deadly surge, the Japanese government announced on Friday that it will take tougher measures to control the bear population.\n \n\n   \n  Many residents take precautions like carrying bells or blasting music out loud to scare away bears. Next time, Halloran said he might consider carrying bear spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just a bit more cautious about what I’m going to be doing,” he said. But, he quipped, winter is arriving soon – and once he heals, he’s looking forward to “some snowboarding and (getting) the mental state back a little bit more, and (getting back) into nature.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israeli-hostage-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Twelfth Deceased Hostage Identified After Two Returned to Israel Overnight, Kibbutz Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the context of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, the return and identification of the twelfth deceased hostage — Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri — marks a critical, though incomplete, step in the recovery of missing family members.

    \n  By Ibrahim Dahman, Mitchell McCluskey, Lauren Izso, Jennifer Hansler, Kareem El Damanhoury, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a twelfth hostage returned to Israel from Gaza has been identified Sunday as Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, as the ceasefire that brought a pause to two years of destruction in the Palestinian enclave comes under strain.\n \n\n   \n  A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Sunday said Oakkharasri’s remains had been identified and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed his family. His was one of two bodies returned by Hamas on Saturday to Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The other body was earlier identified as that of hostage Ronen Engel, according to his kibbutz, and photographs provided to CNN by his family.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over the bodies of Engel and Oakkharasri to the Red Cross on Saturday, after which they were transferred to Israel for formal identification.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Ronen Engel,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz said in a statement. “We will always remember Ronen as a devoted family man, incurably optimistic, with a sense of humor, a joy for life, and a constant smile.”\n \n\n   \n  Oakkharasri was a Thai citizen who was taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 7, 2023. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in May 2024 that Oakkharasri was presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  Engel was 54 when he was killed, and his wife Karina kidnapped along with their daughters Mika and Yuval. His wife and children were released the following month, but Engel’s body was not.\n \n\n   \n  The truce in Gaza appears to be largely holding as it enters its second week, but has come under pressure from the delayed return of the remaining hostage bodies from Gaza, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and Israel’s continued deadly strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department said Saturday that “credible reports” indicate Hamas is planning an “imminent ceasefire violation” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the media note said. “The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Hamas said in a statement Sunday that it “reaffirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement” and “stresses that (Israel) continues to breach the agreement and fabricate flimsy pretexts to justify its crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the State Department’s memo.\n \n\n   \n  With the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which went into effect last week. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not rest and we will not be silent until the last of the hostages is returned,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Protests have ignited in Israel as frustration  intensifies  over the delay in returning the bodies of the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, large crowds of demonstrators gathered on Saturday, urging the government to pressure Hamas to release the bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access and that “extensive efforts and special equipment” would be needed to retrieve more. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Israel believes  that Hamas  does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. Israel’s foreign minister has accused Hamas of trying to use the hostages’ bodies as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Channel 14 on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would end once all of the hostage bodies have been returned and Hamas is demilitarized.\n \n\n   \n  “The war in Gaza will finally end when the terms of the agreement that was supposedly accepted are implemented, and this includes, first of all, Phase A - the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Phase B also includes the disarmament of Hamas, or rather the disarmament of the Strip, and before that the disarmament of Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n    Rafah crossing and crucial aid\n \n\n   \n  As the dispute continues, the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday. The crossing is a  crucial link  between Egypt and Gaza, serving as the enclave’s lifeline for humanitarian aid.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s office said that its opening would be dependent on how “Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas criticized the delayed reopening of the crossing as “a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.” The group also condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military targeted a vehicle carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, on Friday after it crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  After coordinating with the United Nations, the Civil Defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including those of four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/baseball-mlb-alcs-blue-jays-mariners-game-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:22:00-04:00","title":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits sixth homer of postseason as Blue Jays dominate Mariners to force ALCS Game 7","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal moment of the 2025 MLB postseason, the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-2 in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, forcing a decisive Game 7.

Suárez then welcomed reliever Louis Varland with a single down the right-field line to score Arozerana from first base.\n \n\n   \n  But the game was put beyond Seattle’s reach after a wild pitch from Matt Brash in the seventh which allowed Guerrero to score, extending the lead to 6-2 and consequently sending the series to a deciding Game 7.\n \n\n   \n  “Got to enjoy it, man.

tested missile – but it’s out of Ukraine’s reach for now \n       \n  Analysis by Tim Lister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:07 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  Tomahawk  is the workhorse of the United States’ missile arsenal. It’s been deployed in strikes in Syria and Libya and was used extensively against former dictator Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, in both the 1990s and in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  About 30 of the cruise missiles were used as part of the  US strikes  on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.\n \n\n   \n  While not new, the Tomahawk remains effective and relatively cheap, at $2 million per missile. Depending on the variant, it can strike targets at a range of between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers (1,000 to 1,600 miles).\n \n\n   \n  That is not much greater than some of Ukraine’s longer-range drones, but the Tomahawk would pack a far higher explosive punch. It has sophisticated guidance technologies and travels at high subsonic (about 550 mph) speeds.\n \n\n   \n  It also flies low, literally hugging the contours of land, making it harder to detect and intercept.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lobbied the Trump administration for the delivery of Tomahawks that could enable Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia. For now, at least, he’s not going to get them. Trump made clear last week that the US has few to spare, saying: “We need Tomahawks for the United States of America too. We have a lot of them but we need them.”\n \n\n   \n  As we have seen in this war of attrition – with the F-16 fighter jets, Abrams tanks and even Patriot missile batteries supplied to Ukraine – no single system is a game-changer. Hundreds of Tomahawks would be needed to cripple Russia’s refineries and airbases.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, a few dozen could enable the Ukrainian military to inflict substantial damage on key Russian infrastructure far from its borders – including the  Shahed drone factory  in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast, according to Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult just to operate with only with Ukrainian drones. We need long-range Tomahawks,” Zelensky said in an interview with US network NBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He has also said that Tomahawks would “strengthen Ukraine and force the Russians to sober up a little (and) sit down at the negotiating table.”\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin was so perturbed by the prospect of Kyiv procuring Tomahawks that it issued dire warnings about an escalation of the war, given that the missiles can carry nuclear warheads. Russia would perceive their supply to Ukraine as a “hostile move” that would threaten global security, according to the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to preempt the prospect in a lengthy call with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington on October 16.\n \n\n   \n  The Tomahawk is certainly proven in combat. In 1991, when the US and its allies sought to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, 122 Tomahawks were fired at Iraqi defenses in the opening three days of Operation Desert Storm – the first time they had been used. It has also been used for precision strikes in the Balkans, Afghanistan in 1998, Yemen, Libya and Syria. The latest version of the missile was introduced in 2021, with enhanced electronics and a greater range.\n \n\n   \n  However, it has largely been a sea-launched missile.

presidency, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule \n       \n  Story by Reuters\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:25 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Centrist Rodrigo Paz won Bolivia’s presidential runoff on Sunday, defeating conservative rival Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, as the country’s worst economic crisis in a generation helped propel the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule.\n \n\n   \n  Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, beating Quiroga’s 45.5%, according to early results from Bolivia’s electoral tribunal. But Paz’s party does not hold a majority in the country’s legislature, which will force him to forge alliances to govern effectively.\n \n\n   \n  The new president takes office on November 8.\n \n\n   \n  The 58-year-old senator’s win marks a historic shift for the South American country, governed almost continuously since 2006 by Bolivia’s Movement to Socialism, or MAS, which once enjoyed overwhelming support from the country’s Indigenous majority.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s moderate platform — pledging to maintain social programs while promoting private sector-led growth — appeared to resonate with left-leaning voters disillusioned by the ruling MAS, founded by former President Evo Morales, but wary of Quiroga’s proposed austerity measures.\n \n\n   \n  Support for MAS cratered in the August first round amid a  deepening economic crisis .\n \n\n   \n  “This election marks a political turning point,” said Glaeldys Gonzalez Calanche, analyst for the Southern Andes at International Crisis Group. “Bolivia is heading in a new direction,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Both runoff candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with Washington — strained since 2009 — and seek US-backed financial support to stabilize Bolivia’s fragile economy.\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Paz unveiled plans for a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with US officials to ensure fuel supplies.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that both presidential candidates “want stronger, better relations with the United States,” after decades of anti-American leadership. “This election is a transformative opportunity,” he said on October 15.\n \n\n   \n  Outside a polling station in La Paz, Lourdes Mendoza said she had grown weary of the MAS era. “My children were born and raised with a single government,” she said. “I hope they can see other possibilities and alternatives.”\n \n\n   \n    Voters want economic change\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s fragile economy dominated the runoff campaign. Once plentiful natural gas exports have plummeted, inflation is at a 40-year high, and fuel is scarce.\n \n\n   \n  Both candidates campaigned to roll back elements of the MAS era, state-led model, but differed over how drastically. Paz favored gradual reform, including tax incentives for small businesses and regional fiscal autonomy, while Quiroga proposed sweeping cuts and an IMF bailout.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going for a new stage of Bolivian democracy in the 21st century,” Paz told Reuters two days before the election at his family’s ranch in the southern gas-producing region of Tarija.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to try to build an economy for the people,” he said, one where “the state is no longer going to be the central axis.”\n \n\n   \n  Some voters said they were not convinced that his victory represented a true break from MAS: “I think he’s a puppet of the outgoing government,” said 21-year-old Esther Miranda from La Paz, who works in a nail salon.\n \n\n   \n    Running mate’s populist appeal boosts Paz\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s campaign was boosted by his running mate Edman Lara, a former police officer known for viral TikTok videos exposing corruption. Lara’s populist appeal helped Paz connect with younger and working-class voters, analysts said.\n \n\n   \n  Economists warn the incoming administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies and building coalitions in a fragmented legislature.\n \n\n   \n  Outgoing hydrocarbons minister Alejandro Gallardo said last week that the state energy company was struggling to obtain foreign currency for fuel imports.\n \n\n   \n  Paz told Reuters he was already addressing the issue through deferred payment agreements with fuel suppliers to ensure diesel and gasoline arrive within days of his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Paz said he would also begin phasing out universal fuel subsidies. Targeted support would go to vulnerable groups, while bigger industries such as agribusiness would pay market rates for fuel.\n \n\n   \n  “The market will have to adjust prices, but there are sectors that will have government support until the economy is reactivated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s main labor union, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), has previously warned it would oppose any threats to the social and economic gains achieved so far, in a sign of the juggling act for Paz’s government to avoid street protests.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s PDC won 49 of 130 seats in the lower house and 16 of 36 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which secured 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/abortion-politics-democrats-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats are talking about abortion on the campaign trail again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats are re-engaging abortion rights as a central campaign issue in key states like Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, despite emphasizing affordability.

In Pennsylvania, where three state Supreme Court justices are facing  a retention vote , Democrats are pointing to abortion as one of the issues at stake. And in California, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are part of the coalition backing a ballot initiative to enact a  Democratic gerrymander  in response to Republican mid-cycle redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of armchair politics talk from so-called pundits about whether or not the party is talking too much about social issues, not about economic issues,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, which is investing $5 million into 2025 races. “We’re not seeing it that way, and I don’t think any candidates who are actually running see it that way either.”\n \n\n   \n  If Virginia Democrats maintain control of the House of Delegates this year — the state Senate is not up for election — they will aim to create a ballot measure next year enshrining abortion rights into the state Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Republicans will be able to neutralize the issue to the extent Donald Trump did during his race against Kamala Harris. The president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who struck Roe v. Wade, said during the 2024 campaign that he would leave abortion policy “to the states.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there were more single-issue, pro-choice voters, Kamala Harris would be president and the Democrats would control the Senate and the House,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who previously worked with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking office, Trump  stopped Medicaid funding  from going to Planned Parenthood and federal health regulators have opened a study into the safety of  the abortion drug mifepristone , raising concerns among abortion-rights advocates that the US might impose new limits on drugs used by women in states that ban or sharply restrict abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Those advocates say there’s still an opportunity to contrast the positions of the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a mistake to learn the wrong lessons of 2024,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center Action Fund.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats talk about abortion rights and affordability\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger has spent most of her campaign running on affordability, including her plans to reduce health care, housing and energy costs.\n \n\n   \n  But of the $11 million she’s spent on TV ads this year, $1.1 million has gone toward ads in the last 30 days on Earle-Sears’ abortion stance, according to data from media tracking firm AdImpact.\n \n\n   \n  In a new digital ad for Spanberger, former President Barack Obama ties the race to abortion, saying Republicans “will keep attacking abortion rights and the rights of women.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s campaign said in a statement that her “focus remains on addressing” voters’ concerns over high costs and the impact of funding cuts enacted by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “But as we approach the first Virginia gubernatorial election since the fall of Roe, it’s also important for Virginians to know that Winsome Earle-Sears has a long record of opposing reproductive rights for Virginia women,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  A recent Christopher Newport University poll found that abortion was not a top issue for voters, whose top three priorities were threats to democracy, inflation and immigration. But voters said they trusted Spanberger on reproductive rights issues over Earle-Sears by a 20-point margin. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 10 percentage points in the poll.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s running mates have also leaned into abortion as a campaign issue against their opponents, who have backed restricting access.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not solely about abortion,” said Virginia Democratic Party Chair Lamont Bagby. “It’s about protecting Virginian rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general candidate facing condemnation over texts in which he fantasized about the shooting of a legislative colleague, is running an ad featuring a woman who had an abortion. His ad aims to portray Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection, as an “anti-abortion extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic candidate for Virginia lieutenant governor, has spoken on the campaign trail about difficult pregnancies she experienced, including two that resulted in miscarriages.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the right that we are trying to protect for all women, given the complexity and the very, very personal nature of medical care,”  Hashmi, a Virginia state senator, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans try to neutralize abortion access as an issue\n \n\n   \n  Both Earle-Sears and New Jersey’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli — who is running a competitive race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill — have tried to downplay abortion. A spokesperson for Earle-Sears’ campaign said her comments at the  gubernatorial debate  earlier this month reflect her view on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “My position is that the commonwealth needs to come together and figure out where it wants to be,” Earle-Sears said this month. “It’s not going to be my view. It’s going to be a view of the majority.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli has said he supports a woman’s right to choose, though he has voted in the past to limit funding to Planned Parenthood.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is the only Southern state  that has not restricted  abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin hoped to win complete Republican control of the state legislature by boosting candidates running on a 15-week abortion restriction, which he described as a compromise. Instead, Democrats maintained control of the state Senate and flipped the GOP-held House of Delegates.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, Virginia’s attorney general, said he backs exceptions to abortion bans in the case of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia voters will decide this issue directly next year, and Attorney General Miyares will enforce the law they impose, dispassionately and faithfully, as he always has,” a campaign spokesperson said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  John Reid, Hashmi’s opponent for Virginia lieutenant governor, suggested on a recent podcast appearance that the state was at risk of becoming a destination for “abortion tourism.”\n \n\n   \n  Reid said in a statement that he would want to debate Hashmi on abortion and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I would enjoy the opportunity to join Ghazala on the debate stage to discuss the troubling reality that Virginia’s laws have made it an outlier in the region,” he wrote, adding he wants to focus on expanding support for women’s health care and young families.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/basketball-nba-british-players-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:13:00-20:10","title":"The NBA is at its international peak, but British players are still struggling to break through","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA is expanding globally, with a record-tying 125 international players on opening night rosters in 2024-25.

The NBA is at its international peak, but British players are still struggling to break through \n       \n  By Frank Nunns O'Connell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:13 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NBA  is being hit by an international storm, attracting athletes from all corners of the world. At the start of the 2024-25 season, the league announced that a record-tying  125 international players  were on opening night rosters.\n \n\n   \n  Those 125 players came from 43 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Cameroon and Serbia.\n \n\n   \n  Fast-forward to the 2025 NBA draft. Behind the flashing lights and celebratory fireworks surrounding top prospects  Cooper Flagg , Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey was an underappreciated, perhaps even more compelling story of an international player waiting for his big chance.\n \n\n   \n  As social media buzzed through the first round and beyond, Amari Williams waited patiently in the wings. The former University of Kentucky center from Great Britain, far removed from the bright lights, wasn’t your standard international draftee story.\n \n\n   \n  So when he was  selected  by the 18-time NBA champion Boston Celtics midway through the second round, it was more than just a personal triumph – it was a win for British basketball on the world’s biggest stage.\n \n\n   \n  Born and raised in Nottingham, a mid-sized city two hours north of London in England’s East Midlands ,  Williams became just the sixth homegrown British player to be drafted to the NBA in the last 25 years, according to  Hoopsfix .\n \n\n   \n  Following a five-year college stint – playing for Drexel University in the first four and finishing his collegiate career as a Kentucky Wildcat – the  seven-foot center  was drafted by the Orlando Magic, who subsequently traded his draft rights to the Celtics. Boston then signed Williams  to a two-way contract  in mid-August.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a great feeling,” the 23-year-old told  CNN Sports . “They (the Celtics) won it recently, the players they’ve got, all the older guys – I want to adapt and learn as much as I can this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The best thing is there’s no better players to learn from,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Although Williams’ journey has been a successful one, it has by no means been simple. At the age of 16, he moved 118 miles from Nottingham to an agricultural boarding college in rural northwest England, the only place where Williams could pursue basketball full-time.\n \n\n   \n  “We were essentially living on a farm, going from a city like Nottingham to living in the countryside was very different,” Williams said about his upbringing.\n \n\n   \n  Like many British hoopers, Williams had little opportunity to showcase his talents because basketball-dedicated spaces in good condition are few and far between in the United Kingdom. And even when those spaces are available, they are often used for several different competing sports.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a lot of people were able to train as much,” Williams said. “When I moved to Preston, we were able to train, but it’s tough when you have to share with badminton and other sports.”\n \n\n   \n  The average NBA consumer will point towards the likes of San Antonio Spurs power forward Jeremy Sochan or London-born New York Knicks forward OG Anunoby as the association’s British representation.\n \n\n   \n  But the Oklahoma-born Sochan spent half of his high school life in the US, despite growing up in Milton Keynes, and Anunoby swapped the English capital for Missouri at the age of four.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1.5 million people play basketball weekly across the UK and it has grown to be the country’s second most popular team sport in recent years, according to  Sport England’s  2024 Active Lives survey.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, NBA fandom among adults in Britain has grown by 24% since 2022, according to the  UK Government .\n \n\n   \n  So why, despite popularity at a recreational level, are there so few British NBA players?\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lack of direction in the UK,” Knicks forward Tosan Evbuomwan, who was born and raised in Newcastle – a large metropolitan city in northeast England – told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “There haven’t been many guys that have progressed through the UK and play at the top levels, so there’s not many people to give you direction. You have to figure it out yourself a lot of the time, to be honest.”\n \n\n   \n  Evbuomwan experienced that lack of direction from the start of his basketball journey. At the age of 15, with no school team in place, he and a group of friends took it upon themselves to create one.\n \n\n   \n  Although it was his first time playing “organized” basketball, there was no organization about it at all: no coaches, no formal training, just a shared desire to play the game. Together, they coached each other and played in their own tournaments.\n \n\n   \n  After impressing at his first competition, Evbuomwan was scouted by the Newcastle Eagles academy team before being offered a scholarship to play Division One basketball at Ivy League school Princeton University in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Four years of hard work – in which Evbuomwan won Ivy League Player of the Year and was a two-time first-team All-Ivy League selection – resulted in two-way contracts from 2023 onwards with the Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Brooklyn Nets and now the Knicks.\n \n\n   \n  Although the British point guard turned small forward has come a long way on his basketball journey, he never forgets the hardships of where he came from.\n \n\n   \n  “I can probably count on one hand how many shooting guns there are in the whole of the UK,” the 24-year-old chuckled, referring to a specific type of shooting machine used in drills.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and my friends used to play all the time: one-on-one, two-on-two. I didn’t know we were supposed to get shots up and work on movements.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting shots up was the simplest, most basic thing in terms of practice and basketball and I didn’t know to do that at all – and I’m sure I wasn’t alone.”\n \n\n   \n  To be an aspiring British basketball player is to live with hopes and dreams that may never be fulfilled. And despite the game’s immense popularity, the sport is in the grips of a governance crisis in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, global basketball governing body FIBA  temporarily suspended  the British Basketball Federation (BBF) and banned the British men’s national team from playing in FIBA senior competitions.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after the basketball authority established a taskforce in August to investigate and address “apparent governance issues and regulatory non-compliance” within British men’s club competitions.\n \n\n   \n  An  ongoing dispute  between the BBF, a group of investors and teams in the UK’s current professional league (Super League Basketball), has reached Britain’s High Court with an initial hearing set for July 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement , the BBF said that it is committed to “restoring, confidence, transparency and sustainability within the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has reached out to the BBF for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turmoil in the British professional game, work is being done at the grassroots level to nurture the sport.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the UK government announced that basketball will benefit from a joint £10 million (roughly $13.4 million) investment at a recreational level.\n \n\n   \n  A  press release  from the government reported that £5 million will be committed to basketball in 2026/27, with the NBA matching that investment with their own funding of £5 million through to 2028. The joint investment plans to bring the game to communities up and down the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Basketball is booming in Britain – and this investment will help take it to the next level, opening up the game to thousands more people right across the country,” said UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about more than sport – it’s about community, inclusion and inspiring the next generation to find their spark.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite work being done on the recreational level, without a well-organized system currently in place to help nurture talent at the top level, there are few pioneers that the next generation can look up to.\n \n\n   \n  But rather poetically, Williams cites Evbuomwan as someone who inspired him on his NBA journey.\n \n\n   \n  “In my age group, or around my age, Tosan was the first to do it and be able to make the NBA,” said Williams.\n \n\n   \n  “From playing in Newcastle and going to Princeton, seeing him do it has inspired me and a lot of other people to take that path.”\n \n\n   \n  Ideally, that path becomes more attainable as time goes on, giving aspiring British talent more stars to look up to when they do get shots up.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I can do to help him and the younger generation, I’ll always be there,” Evbuomwan said of mentoring Williams.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and Amari have a real relationship and that only helps the situation. In the same way, me and Sochan talk and he’s helped me – being here a year longer, that experience really does matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/tourism-shutdown-national-park-smithsonians","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-20:00","title":"Advocates and Businesses Warn of Long-Term Impact of Government Shutdown on National Parks and Tourism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a prolonged government shutdown in 2025, national parks including the Grand Canyon, New River Gorge, and Yosemite remained open despite the furloughing of 9,000 National Park Service employees.

shutdown \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown didn’t deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors’ center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.\n \n\n   \n  “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that’s what worries me the most.”\n \n\n   \n  While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism’s impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”\n \n\n   \n  Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they’re bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he’s not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.\n \n\n   \n  “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation’s capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to  close its museums  and the National Zoo on October 12.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC’s trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s data  on daily train station entries and bus boardings.\n \n\n   \n    Concerns about long-term impact of the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson also warned of the shutdown’s economic impact on the nation’s capital, which  lost about $47.4 million  in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”\n \n\n   \n  And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.\n \n\n   \n  With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.’”\n \n\n   \n  She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.\n \n\n   \n  With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they’re not going to have the full experience that they’re used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.\n \n\n   \n  “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson’s group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  In Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group’s communication’s director. “We don’t know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We’ll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marshall Cohen, Brian Todd and Austin Culpepper contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/ddlj-bollywood-30-years-anniversary-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00Z","title":"Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which has maintained a daily screening at the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai for nearly 30 years.

classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snighda Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking. This is compounded by the reduction of Simran’s agency to the singular goal of marrying her beloved, leaving her own personal ambitions completely unexplored.\n \n\n   \n  “What does she do? What are her work ambitions?” Sur said. “I want to know more about what she’s studying, where she wants to work.”\n \n\n   \n  For Anupama Chopra, the whole idea of Simran “being parceled between lover and father” is equally frustrating. “But every film is a product of its time,” she said. “And I can tell you at the premiere, none of us thought there was any problem with it because we didn’t know any better. We were swept by the romance.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Maratha Mandir, crowds casually trickle in, well into the film’s three-hour runtime.\n \n\n   \n  It’s clear that most have seen the movie before, yet when a big moment arrives, phones go up to capture it for social media as cheers erupt with a joy that feels brand new.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in one of the back rows, the diamond worker Shedge takes it all in.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as I’m alive and until my last breath,” he said. “I’ll keep watching this film.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/football-nfl-week-7-sunday-review-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:59:00-04:00","title":"Historic and dramatic comebacks, second-year QB breaks Tom Brady record and high-profile benchings: NFL Week 7 Sunday review","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was defined by dramatic comebacks and significant quarterback changes.

\nUpdated: \n        5:59 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The theme of the  NFL  season so far has been the uncertainty of results, with late comebacks or collapses happening more and more.\n \n\n   \n  And Week 7 was no different, with teams overturning seemingly insurmountable leads to somehow rescue results from the most unlikely of situations.\n \n\n   \n  Through the first seven weeks of the campaign, there have been 26 games with a lead change in the final two minutes of regulation this season, the most in NFL history over that span.\n \n\n   \n  There were also records broken and several starting quarterbacks benched for struggling squads.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know from Sunday’s action in  Week 7  of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Down, but not out\n \n\n   \n  Like other weeks, Sunday was punctuated with comebacks from the most unlikely of positions.\n \n\n   \n  The most dramatic of those came in Denver where the Broncos overturned a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to stun the New York Giants 33-32.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos offense had been largely lifeless through the first three quarters at Empower Field, even leading to some boos from the home crowd. The Giants, meanwhile, had rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart moving the ball and putting points on the board, throwing two touchdown passes and running back Tyrone Tracy rushing in another.\n \n\n   \n  That’s when everything went out the window.\n \n\n   \n  Second-year passer Bo Nix exploded from his slumber, throwing 16-of-25 for 174 yards and two touchdowns while also running for two scores in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Having scored four TDs in the final quarter, the Broncos still trailed by two points following a one-yard Dart touchdown run with just 37 seconds remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But Nix connected with Marvin Mims and Courtland Sutton on deep passes to set up a Wil Lutz field goal as time expired to hand Denver a remarkable victory.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , teams were 161-0 since 2007 when shutting out their opponent and leading by 18 points or more after first three quarters before Sunday. The Broncos are now the first team to overcome that deficit in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Nix reflected on the dramatic comeback.\n \n\n   \n  “I was thinking about how I was going to answer questions if we got shut out. It’s not where you want to be,” he told reporters. “At some point, I knew we’ve done it before in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We know at some point we are going to go ahead and score. It may be too late and we may not score enough, but at some point, we are going to do it. We did. We had a good drive there at the end of the third and scored quickly in the fourth. It’s almost like once we scored and got the two-point conversion we knew how to play all of a sudden. I don’t have many answers but we just kept fighting.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t the only late comeback on Sunday though.\n \n\n   \n  The Green Bay Packers also scored two touchdowns in the final quarter, including one with just under two minutes left, and forced a late turnover on downs deep in their own territory to beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-23.\n \n\n   \n  The Cardinals, led by backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, needed a touchdown on their final drive of the game to secure an unlikely victory.\n \n\n   \n  But, as had been the case throughout the game, Brissett was disrupted by a swarming Packers defense led by Micah Parsons, who was a terror all game.\n \n\n   \n  Parsons, who was traded to Green Bay from the Dallas Cowboys in a blockbuster trade ahead of the season, had his third sack of the game on Arizona’s last drive and was disruptive throughout as the Packers improved to 4-1-1 on the season and first in the NFC North division.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots QB breaks Tom Brady record\n \n\n   \n  Following Tom Brady’s departure from New England and the end of his Super Bowl-laden spell with the Patriots, the franchise has been searching for its next cornerstone quarterback.\n \n\n   \n  And if this season’s displays are anything to go by, they might’ve just found him in the form of Drake Maye.\n \n\n   \n  Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, had arguably his best performance yet in a Patriots jersey on Sunday, going almost perfect in the team’s 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old threw 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries. He was poised in the pocket and made vital throws at key moments, while he was helped out by a solid running game.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps even more impressively, Maye fell to the ground and took a hard hit to the head in the second quarter, leaving the game and returning a few moments later to throw a touchdown pass to Austin Hooper.\n \n\n   \n  In his excellent performance, Maye hit two historic milestones.\n \n\n   \n  He became first player in the Super Bowl era to complete 90% of his passes, throw for over 200 yards and rush for over 50 yards in a single game.\n \n\n   \n  More notably for the Patriots, his 91.3 completion percentage broke Brady’s  franchise record of 88.5% , which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Maye said after the game that it comes as a result of the whole team improving together.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ve just grown as an organization. I think with (head) coach (Mike) Vrabel and his staff I think we’re just buying into each other and build an identity,” Maye told reporters. “And I think that’s what’s kind of the biggest thing for me is trying to be the same player every week.”\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s performance continues Maye’s breakout season with the Patriots and gave head coach Mike Vrabel a victory in his first game against the franchise who fired him in January 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Some Titans fans could be heard chanting Vrabel’s name as the game went on, with some even holding up signs apologizing to him for how his time in Tennessee ended.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t get that many tickets, I don’t know …,” Vrabel said of the chants. “I’m happy for our players. I think these guys they’re figuring out how to win, they’re figuring out how to practice. I guess it’s humbling to have these people whoever that is cheer for us whether that’s the Patriots or Drake Maye or me or anybody else.”\n \n\n   \n    Benchings\n \n\n   \n  While some teams are on the up, for others, the season might already be over.\n \n\n   \n  Take the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets for instance. The two AFC East rivals are a combined 1-13 after each suffered a humbling loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  For Miami, it was a disaster from start to finish, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throwing three interceptions for the second straight week, including one which was returned for a touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  Tagovailoa’s performance was so catastrophic that he was benched in the fourth quarter for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers.\n \n\n   \n  There were very few positives to take from the 31-6 defeat to the Browns for head coach Mike McDaniel – the team suffered errors on defense, turnovers on offense and key penalties throughout – with pressure ramping up on his position.\n \n\n   \n  The vibes are arguably worse with the Jets who remained the only winless team at 0-7 in the NFL after their 13-6 home loss to the Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, the Jets defense showed up, but the offense failed to pick up its end of the bargain. It got so bad that New York quarterback Justin Fields was benched at halftime after struggling in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  Over the first two quarters against Carolina, Fields went 6-of-12 on his pass attempts for 46 yards and added 22 rushing yards on four carries, leading an offense which totaled 97 yards during his time on the field.\n \n\n   \n  Fields was replaced by Tyrod Taylor who was able to move the ball more effectively but threw two costly interceptions.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the quarterback change after the game, head coach Aaron Glenn said his team “needed a spark.”\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that it was the right time to do it,” Glenn explained. “It’s a tough situation for both of those guys, but it was my call. It was my call and I felt it was the right time to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  The loss was even more damning for first-year head coach Glenn given the fact that Carolina lost starting QB Bryce Young to an ankle injury midway through the second half and was still able to hold out for a first win on the road this season.\n \n\n   \n  Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets in the offseason but Glenn was noncommittal about who the team’s starting quarterback going forward will be.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll make the call,” Glenn said, “but there’s a lot of conversation I got to have with myself to see what can I do to make sure that we give us a chance to win.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll make the right decision. Whatever the decision is, I’m going to go with it and we’re going to move forward.”\n \n\n   \n    Full Week 7 Sunday scores\n \n\n   \n   Home vs. away (winners in bold) \n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville Jaguars 7-35  Los Angeles Rams  (in London, UK)\n \n\n   \n   Chicago Bears  26-14 New Orleans Saints\n \n\n   \n   Cleveland Browns  31-6 Miami Dolphins\n \n\n   \n   Kansas City Chiefs  31-0 Las Vegas Raiders\n \n\n   \n  Minnesota Vikings 22-28  Philadelphia Eagles  \n \n\n   \n  New York Jets 6-13  Carolina Panthers \n \n\n   \n  Tennessee Titans 13-31  New England Patriots \n \n\n   \n   Denver Broncos  33-32 New York Giants\n \n\n   \n  Los Angeles Chargers 24-38  Indianapolis Colts \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals 23-27  Green Bay Packers \n \n\n   \n   Dallas Cowboys  44-22 Washington Commanders\n \n\n   \n   San Francisco 49ers  20-10 Atlanta Falcons\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/plane-slides-off-runway-hong-kong-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00-20:00","title":"Two killed as cargo plane skids off runway into the sea in Hong Kong","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A cargo plane operated by Turkish carrier ACT Airlines, flying under an Emirates flight number, skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, killing two airport staff in a vehicle it struck and pushed into the sea.

marches only proved the protesters’ point \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he’s acting as a king.\n \n\n   \n  But Donald Trump and his entourage responded with mockery to weekend  “No Kings” protests  by millions of Americans — embracing the narrative in a way that explains his growing hubris and belief that he has unchecked power.\n \n\n   \n  The president and Vice President JD Vance this weekend both posted AI memes to social media depicting Trump in a crown. The  one Trump shared  was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance’s  troll on Bluesky , a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler.\n \n\n   \n  It was a clever political trick. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters’ gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He’s far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don’t agree with. Presidents  Barack Obama  and  Joe Biden , as well as 2016 Democratic nominee  Hillary Clinton , all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  But the president’s social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren’t for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don’t again rule America. He’s implying there’s no room for those who don’t support him and showing he’s willing to force them into line. \n \n\n   \n  Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a  government shutdown  the president appears to have no desire to end.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more  universities refusing to bend  to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.\n \n\n   \n  The president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday’s mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n     “When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s latest monarchical moves\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.\n \n\n   \n  His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of  former Rep. George Santos , who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president’s latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This  followed his demands  that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were  followed by indictments  scant weeks later.\n \n\n   \n  Santos on Sunday related to CNN’s Dana Bash how he’d been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,”  Santos said , “I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos’ former GOP colleague from New York,  said of Santos : “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”\n \n\n   \n  Pardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump’s treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system’s reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)\n \n\n   \n  The president’s authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.\n \n\n   \n  ► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a  seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean  that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump’s promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration’s unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress’ authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I’m not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn’t do this by himself.”\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump last week detailed his decision  to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela , prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump  stoked speculation  of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won’t be done nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump’s methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America’s global reputation. His administration’s refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The saga is unfolding as Hegseth’s Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration’s  draconian new press regulations . The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration’s determination to  deploy troops  on  American soil .\n \n\n   \n    Protesters challenge the administration’s dismissal of demonstrations\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides tried to  diminish and defame  the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party’s constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president’s vulgar social media posts mocked them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  In time, Saturday’s protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump’s first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.\n \n\n   \n  At the least, they show that while many of Trump’s supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don’t.\n \n\n   \n  And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a  warning by Obama on Marc Maron’s final  podcast that it wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We’re not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.\n \n\n   \n  Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/china-fourth-plenum-ccp-meeting-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:28:00-04:00","title":"Roiled by purges and buffeted by US frictions, China’s leadership meets to chart country’s rise","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China’s leadership, under President Xi Jinping, is convening the fourth plenum to finalize its next five-year economic plan (2026–2030), emphasizing technological self-reliance in AI, quantum computing, new energy, and biotechnology amid growing trade tensions with the United States.

Gathering Communist Party elites will review China’s upcoming five-year plan, an economic blueprint whose direction is strictly dictated by top leadership in the authoritarian state. Meanwhile, the  US government shutdown  stretches toward its third week as democratically elected lawmakers remain locked in a standoff over spending in the year ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The plenum will be closely monitored by outsiders for clues about the inner workings of China’s opaque ruling Communist Party. Intrigue heightened on Friday, when state media announced the  ousting of China’s No. 2 general , the highest-ranking casualty yet of Xi’s ongoing anti-corruption purge of the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The conclave comes at a critical time for Beijing. China’s leadership sees itself as navigating an increasingly hostile global landscape – with US trade frictions and mounting restrictions on Chinese access to Western technology – while also grappling with deep-seated economic challenges at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economic growth slowed to its lowest point this year in the third quarter, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, which reported 4.8% growth year-on-year – down from 5.2% the previous quarter – as those pressures weigh on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 full and non-voting delegates of the powerful Central Committee will gather in Beijing for the closed-door plenum, one of seven meetings typically held within five years, between party congresses.\n \n\n   \n  The five-year plan in focus this week is expected to emphasize China’s economic security and technological innovation in sectors like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new energy and biotechnology. It will run from 2026 through the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But that won’t be the only item on the agenda, and the conclave may also include a personnel reshuffle if new officials are appointed to key roles vacated by those purged.\n \n\n   \n    The next five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not emerge until after it is approved by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March next year. But Xi has already given strong hints about his priorities as he looks to adjust China’s economic strategy to ensure “high-quality development” for the rest of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade that Xi could well see out in power. The strongman leader broke precedent to remain head of the party and the state for a third term starting in 2022, and has so far avoided elevating an heir apparent.\n \n\n   \n  Xi earlier this year called on provincial leaders to spend the next five years focusing on the development of emerging and future industries and breakthroughs in core and cutting-edge technologies, while also coordinating “development and security” and considering “internal and external risks.”\n \n\n   \n  China has already made sweeping advances in high-tech industries, like electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, and is fast catching up with the US in other advanced areas like semiconductors, AI and biotech – sectors included in the current five-year plan, which ends this year.\n \n\n   \n  But the country’s industrial innovation has also been marred by production overcapacity. A surge of production has fueled frictions with trade partners that accuse China of flooding global markets, while also contributing to persistent deflation and price wars between competing firms at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economy also needs rebalancing as it faces a prolonged property slump, persistent deflation, weak consumer demand and high youth employment, as well as longer-term concerns like its rapidly aging and shrinking population.\n \n\n   \n  China’s slowing growth in the third quarter relative to the rest of the year increases pressure on the Communist Party to accomplish its annual growth target of around 5%. Overall, the economy has grown 5.2% year-on-year in the first three quarters.\n \n\n   \n  Officials on Monday attributed the third quarter decline to a “complex and severe external environment,” including the impact of tariffs on the global economy, as well as China’s economic transition between “new and old” drivers of growth.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic headwinds, many observers expect Xi will largely look to stay the course he’s already charted for China, while making some targeted adjustments.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few reasons to expect that a new five-year plan would deviate, considering that Xi Jinping has been in control of the whole system now very definitively … and doesn’t need to have a big headline (initiative)” at this stage, said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  Gunter said to expect “some signaling” in the coming plan around boosting consumption and addressing “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. But signs of a deeper shift, if it comes, would include meaningful efforts in the coming months and years to expand the social safety net and tackle issues around subsidies and over-investment, among others, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential personnel moves\n \n\n   \n  All eyes will also be on any personnel changes that could take place this week, including potential appointments to the powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees China’s 2 million-strong armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The CMC has been rocked by Xi’s anti-corruption purge, with three of the body’s six uniformed members ousted since 2023, including He Weidong, the No. 2 general.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of his removal Friday confirmed months of speculation about He’s fate after he  vanished from public view last March . He, who served as a CMC vice chairman, was also a member of the 24-member Politburo, the second-highest echelon of Communist Party leadership.\n \n\n   \n  His ousting from the party was announced alongside that of fellow CMC member Miao Hua, who was removed from his military position in June, as well as seven other officers. All “were suspected of severe duty-related crimes involving exceptionally large amounts of money,” according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  The shake-up leaves an unusual number of spots open on the party’s Central Committee, which began its term in 2022 with 205 members and 171 non-voting alternates. About a dozen seats are expected to be filled by alternate members at this plenum.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear whether Xi will choose to refill the ranks of the CMC, which he chairs – or whether he will prefer to keep his close hold on the smaller group.\n \n\n   \n  The existing vacancies on the Central Committee and the potential for other disciplinary moves this week could bring “the biggest personnel shake-up” at a plenum since at least 2017, according to Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “Record purges strengthen, not weaken, Xi’s grip over the party and the (People’s Liberation Army). Every Central Committee member knows their future hinges on staying in Xi’s good graces,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/entertainment/sam-rivers-death-limp-bizkit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"Limp Bizkit Band Members Say Bass Player Sam Rivers Has Died","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sam Rivers, the bassist of the nu metal band Limp Bizkit, has died, according to social media posts by band members.

  9:51 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal agency responsible for overseeing and modernizing the US nuclear stockpile will furlough the vast majority of its staff Monday as the  government shutdown  drags on, according to the Department of Energy.\n \n\n   \n  About 1,400 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, will receive furlough notices Monday, while fewer than 400 employees will remain on the job to safeguard the stockpile, Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Secretary Chris Wright will speak about the shutdown’s impact on the US’ nuclear deterrent efforts Monday while visiting the Nevada National Security Site.\n \n\n   \n  The NNSA Office of Secure Transportation, which oversees the transportation of nuclear weapons around the country, will be funded through October 27.\n \n\n   \n  “Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses,” Dietderich said in a statement. “We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”\n \n\n   \n  The furloughs will first impact NNSA sites that assemble nuclear weapons, such as Pantex in Texas and Y-12 in Tennessee, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Because those facilities require large teams to manufacture weapons, furloughs will force those sites into safe shutdown mode.\n \n\n   \n  “Contractors will continue doing very minimal work until they themselves run out of money,” another NNSA source said. “But the day-to-day rhythm of federal oversight, the approvals and monitoring of these contractors, keeping everything on track, will grind to a halt because the people responsible for oversight will be furloughed.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s furloughs mark the first wave of disruption for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever minimal work contractors are able to continue to do as far as building weapons, enriching special nuclear material, stockpile surveillance, that will stop when the contractors run out of money,” the second source warned. “The earliest we could see that happen is around October 28.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, the agency would no longer be able to deliver weapons to the Department of Defense. “Everything would be locked up,” the second source said.\n \n\n   \n  Shutting down mid-operation comes with its own complications.\n \n\n   \n  “To stop in the middle of disassembling or building a nuclear weapon, there are several steps you must take to ensure everything is safe enough to leave and lock up,” the second source explained. “And then when you come back, you have to do all of that in reverse to restart. It takes time, it’s not like flipping a light switch.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, both NNSA sources say, there is no immediate national security threat.\n \n\n   \n  “The nuclear stockpile today is reliable and can accomplish what it’s designed to do,” the second source said. “But if we can’t continue our modernization, refurbishing, doing surveillance, then it’s the reliability of the stockpile that’s affected, and it’s going to take some time to play catch up on all of that work.”\n \n\n   \n  Security staff guarding facilities with weapons and nuclear materials will remain on the job. However, ceasing operations at Pantex and Y-12 will stall modernization efforts for the US nuclear stockpile, the sources told CNN. The Department of Defense has been pushing the NNSA to produce new and modernized weapons on time, and a government shutdown could delay that schedule significantly — depending on how long it lasts.\n \n\n   \n  “While the Energy Department and NNSA remain committed to ensuring the safety and security of America’s nuclear deterrent, the longer the shutdown lasts, the more damaging and dire the consequences will be for workforce retention and weapons modernization efforts critical to national security,” Dietderich said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the agency, frustration is high.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of frustration and disappointment that Congress can’t get this done,” one source said. “Especially considering what’s at stake.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/europe/robbery-louvre-paris-france-museum-closure-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:19:00-20:20","title":"Thieves steal ‘priceless’ jewelry from the Louvre in 7-minute raid","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a meticulously planned heist that took place just after the opening of the Louvre Museum in Paris on October 19, 2025, four armed individuals stole eight of nine high-value Crown Jewels from the Apollo Gallery.

“priceless” jewelry from the Louvre in Paris in an audacious seven-minute raid that took place just after the world’s  most-visited museum  opened on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  In what appeared to be a professional heist, the robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, and made off with artefacts from the French Crown Jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  Two high-security display cases were targeted, and eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for, including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, the French culture ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves forced open a window using an angle grinder and stole jewelry that has “sentimental value and is priceless,” French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said.\n \n\n   \n  Four perpetrators appear to have been involved in the theft, who were unarmed, but threatened the guards with the angle grinders, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.\n \n\n   \n  Beccuau said that investigators have not ruled out foreign interference as a possible line of inquiry into the theft; but were keeping all leads open.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves dropped or left behind one item – the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III.\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond their market value, the items have inestimable heritage and historical value,” the interior ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron said that “everything is being done” to catch the suspects.\n \n\n   \n  “The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage we cherish because it is part of our history,” Macron said on X, “ We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  A detailed list of the stolen items released by the culture ministry revealed a single earring from the sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, an emerald necklace and pair of emerald earrings from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise, the “reliquary brooch,” and the tiara and large corsage bow brooch of Empress Eugénie were stolen in the heist.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to set fire to the truck used to carry out the raid was foiled by a Louvre security officer, according to the culture ministry’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation for “aggravated theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy to commit a felony,” has been opened by Paris police under the authority of Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get out, evacuate’\n \n\n   \n  The robbery took only seven minutes, with the suspects fleeing on motorcycles, Nuñez told France Inter radio. “Clearly, a team had been scouting the location. It was obviously a very experienced team that acted very, very quickly,” he aid.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confident that we will very quickly find the perpetrators and, above all, recover the stolen goods,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  According to Le Parisien newspaper,  police found two angle grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, a blanket and a crown at the scene of the robbery. A yellow vest used by the perpetrators to disguise themselves as workmen was found a bit further away, lost during their escape, the newspaper said.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed French police examining an abandoned furniture elevator positioned next to a corner of the Louvre, with its ladder leading up to a broken window off a balcony.\n \n\n   \n  A tour guide told CNN how he had heard what sounded like “stomping” on the window as he led tourists through the Apollo Room, before hearing shouts from security guards to evacuate.\n \n\n   \n  “I was just trying to figure out what’s happening when I saw the museum staff going to that noise. Then they did a turn around, like real quick, and they started running and saying ‘get out, get out, get out, get out, evacuate!’” Ryan el Mandari said.\n \n\n   \n  He tried to keep his group of visitors calm as they left the building, he said, adding that they heard the sounds but “had no clue that it was a robbery.”\n \n\n   \n    Robbery planned ‘meticulously’\n \n\n   \n  The French interior ministry said the incident took place at 9:30 a.m. local time and that members of the public had been evacuated without incident.\n \n\n   \n  Minister of Culture Rachida Dati said the robbery had taken place as the museum opened. “No injuries were reported. I am on site alongside museum staff and the police. Investigations are ongoing,” Dati said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The museum, which houses world-famous artworks including Leonardo da Vinci’s  Mona Lisa,  said it would remain closed on Sunday due to “exceptional reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  The interior ministry later said the closure was a security measure to preserve evidence for the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Paris Center, Ariel Weil, told reporters that the thieves had “planned this meticulously, obviously” and that he could not recall the Louvre being the target of a robbery in more than a century. “I’m thinking, of course, of the  Mona Lisa sting  in 1911, but I can’t think of any more recent robbery,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/george-santos-interview-prison-commuted-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-04:00","title":"George Santos maintains his prosecution was political, says he’s had a ‘very large slice of humble pie’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"George Santos, a former U.S. Representative from New York, was released from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for fraud charges.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US conducted a strike Friday on a boat that American intelligence officials believed was involved in illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote in a  post on X  that the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. He said the three men on the boat were all killed and no US forces were harmed.\n \n\n   \n  This is the seventh known strike in a series of recent attacks by the US military on vessels that the Trump administration says are involved in drug trafficking. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. President Donald Trump said Saturday the survivors of that strike were released to  their home countries  of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote Sunday. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The strikes are a part of the Trump administration’s hardening stance against South American countries allegedly involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the US. The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would cancel all US payments and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n  Petro  responded on X , calling Trump “ignorant” and denying his involvement in illegal drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant,  legal experts previously told CNN , because it appears to give grounds for the president designating drug traffickers as enemy combatants and having them summarily killed without legal review.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, people involved in drug trafficking have been considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate blocked a push earlier this month to limit Trump’s ability to command the military to strike alleged drug boats without congressional authorization.\n \n\n   \n  Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski were the only Republican lawmakers to cross party lines and support the resolution.\n \n\n   \n  “We basically are summarily executing people who are accused of something.

Danaher and Camille Knight, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:16 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s audacious heist  saw thieves  break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery and make off with jewelry of “inestimable” value. The suspects carried out the burglary in just seven minutes, France’s interior minister Laurent Nuñez told radio station France Inter.\n \n\n   \n  French media reported that thieves had attempted to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but the crown was found outside the Louvre, according to French culture minister Rachida Dati. The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   \n  The robbery, which prompted the swift evacuation of visitors and the museum’s closure for the rest of the day, is only the latest in a series of troubles to befall the venerable institution.\n \n\n   \n  Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. King Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793. Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French. But the large crowds entering through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building – and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, French newspaper  Le Parisien  reported on a confidential letter sent from the president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning of the dilapidated state of one of Europe’s top attractions.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, dated January 23 and confirmed to CNN by the Louvre, des Cars requested urgent help to address a slew of issues affecting the museum. She warned of an increase in damage to the museum’s spaces, with some areas becoming “very deteriorated.”\n \n\n   \n  Problems included water leaks, overcrowding, and worrying temperature fluctuations which threatened to “endanger the conservation of works of art,” the memo detailed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum president cautioned that the Louvre was offering “insufficient” services to the public due to overcrowding, with food services and restrooms “well below international standards” in number.\n \n\n   \n  “Visiting the Louvre constitutes a physical ordeal; reaching the artworks takes time and is not always easy,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors often flock to the Salle des États to see one of the most famous artworks in the museum, if not the world, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” But the museum president called for the placement of the artwork to be reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron announced later that month that the “Mona Lisa” would get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre as part of major renovation plans. The expansion of the Parisian landmark is expected to take up to 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Just six months later, in June, the museum closed its doors for a day as workers there went on strike, complaining of unmanageable crowds, understaffing and poor working conditions in a building unable to handle its current popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s brazen daylight robbery was also not the first instance of theft to beset the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Most famously, the jewel in the Louvre’s crown, the “Mona Lisa,”  was stolen in 1911  by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia. Having slipped the painting under his clothing, Peruggia escaped the building undetected and wasn’t caught for two years. The public became fascinated by the two-year manhunt, with the daring burglary catapulting the “Mona Lisa” from a relatively unknown work to a world-renowned icon.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, two pieces of  16th-century armor  were returned to the Louvre Museum almost 40 years after they were stolen. The Renaissance-era helmet and body armor were on display in the Louvre when they were stolen overnight from May 31 to June 1, 1983. It wasn’t until March 2021 that the stolen artefacts were returned to the museum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/colombia-trump-petro-subsidies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"Trump Escalates Back-and-Forth with Colombia’s President, Announcing End of US Payments to Country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the end of all US financial payments and subsidies to Colombia, criticizing President Gustavo Petro for failing to curb drug production, which he claims has been enabled by decades of US funding.

Colombia’s president, announcing end of US payments to country \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump announced Sunday he would end all US payments and subsidies to Colombia, marking a dramatic escalation in his back-and-forth with the country’s president, Gustavo Petro.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in a  post  to social media that Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country, “despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America.”\n \n\n   \n  “As of today, these payments, or any other form of payment, or subsidies, will no longer be made to Colombia,” the president said in all caps.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders have clashed on the issues of migration and drug trafficking, especially as the US conducts  strikes on alleged drug boats  in the Caribbean, but Sunday’s announcement intensified the friction with new financial stakes.\n \n\n   \n  The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to  data  from the US Department of State. It was not immediately clear which payments Trump was referring to Sunday, but the US is by far the largest funder of Colombia’s security, providing billions of dollars every year. The Andean country had previously been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on national security and defense.\n \n\n   \n  Trump warned Petro that he “better close up these killing fields,” referring to areas where drugs are produced, “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come after his administration said  last month  that Colombia had “failed demonstrably” in its obligations to fight drug trafficking but that the US would continue to provide funding to the country. Colombia is the world’s leading producer of cocaine, accounting for almost two-thirds of total production, according to the United Nations Office for Drug and Crime.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Petro have sparred for months, most recently as Petro accused the US of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of the Trump administration’s strikes in the Caribbean. Last month, the US  revoked Petro’s visa  after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump during a visit to the United Nations General Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  The escalation also comes as the US has taken aim at what it says is illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean with a series of military strikes on vessels.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the US conducted a strike Friday on a boat that American intelligence officials believed had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. Hegseth said the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and that all three men aboard were killed.\n \n\n   \n  That marked the seventh known strike, and came days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that  CNN reported  appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. Trump announced Saturday that the two survivors of that strike would be  returned to their home countries  of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Sunday attacked Petro in personal terms, describing him as an “illegal drug leader” with “a fresh mouth.”\n \n\n   \n  Petro responded to Trump later Sunday, and while he did not address the financial implications of a freeze of US assistance, he criticized the US president, invoking his country’s heralded Nobel Prize-winning author, Gabriel García Márquez.\n \n\n   \n  “You are rude and ignorant toward Colombia. Read, as your chargé d’affaires in Colombia did, ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude,’ and I assure you, you will learn something about solitude,” Petro said in a post to social media.\n \n\n   \n  The 1967 novel chronicles the rise and fall of a fictional Colombian town.\n \n\n   \n  Petro continued, “I don’t do business like you do — I am a socialist. I believe in solidarity, the common good, and the shared resources of humanity, the greatest of all: life, now endangered by your oil. If I’m not a businessman, then I am even less a drug trafficker. There is no greed in my heart.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/sport/hockey-nhl-san-jose-sharks-apology","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-04:00","title":"San Jose Sharks Apologize for 'Offensively Worded Message' Displayed During Hispanic Heritage Night","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The San Jose Sharks apologized after an offensive message praising Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was displayed on the SAP Center scoreboard during their Hispanic Heritage Night celebration against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Lister and Svitlana Vlasova\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:07 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian forces are still edging forward along several parts of the long front line in Ukraine – despite yet another call from US President Donald Trump for a  combat freeze  along existing lines.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides “should stop where they are,” Trump said on social media Friday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington DC.\n \n\n   \n  But the Russians seem intent on locking in gains before the onset of winter. On Friday, they used a record 268 guided aerial bombs, according to the Ukrainian military, compared to an average of 170 to 180 per day in recent weeks. These bombs, which carry a payload of up to 1,500 kilograms (3,307 pounds), largely target Ukrainian forces and infrastructure close to the front lines.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians have also continued  nightly barrages  of drones and missiles against targets across Ukraine, especially against energy infrastructure. In September, an average of more than 180 drones were launched every night, more than twice the number at the beginning of the year.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, the Ukrainians have acknowledged that about 20% to 30% of those drones are not being intercepted.\n \n\n   \n  In the last week, Russia has used more than 3,270 attack drones, 1,370 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types against Ukraine, Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  To some analysts, the Kremlin has no incentive to compromise as its forces improve their battlefield performance.\n \n\n   \n  “Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength,” writes long-time Russia analyst Dara Massicot  in Foreign Affairs .\n \n\n   \n  “It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan,” Massicot adds.\n \n\n   \n  One town where Ukrainians are under growing pressure is Kupiansk, in the northern region of Kharkiv. Russian troops have advanced to the north and east of the town, which has been under siege for more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  A well-known Russian blogger, War Gonzo, said Saturday on Telegram that there was also fighting in the center of Kupiansk. About 80 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, the Ukrainian military acknowledged on Thursday, and its defenders were “doing everything possible to clear Kupiansk of Russian invaders and prevent the accumulation of enemy infantry in the city.”\n \n\n   \n  One Ukrainian military blogger – Bohdan Miroshnikov – said this week that the Russian tactic “may lead to control (if reinforcements can arrive and consolidate their positions).” He added that while the situation was very complicated, “full occupation of the city is still a long way off.”\n \n\n   \n  Also in Kharkiv region, closer to the international border, the Russians have claimed advances near the town of Vovchansk, including the capture of a nearby village.\n \n\n   \n  In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk, with a Russian military blogger claiming Saturday that Russian troops are advancing to the northwestern outskirts of the city. For its part, the Ukrainian military has claimed to have recovered some 70 square miles of territory in the Pokrovsk area over the past two months, in a series of counterattacks.\n \n\n   \n  Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian forces, insisted Friday that the Russians did not have “the strategic initiative. At the cost of enormous losses, the adversary has achieved only minor advances in certain sections of the front.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ukrainian warriors have ceased the enemy’s spring-summer offensive campaign,” Syrskyi added.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has gained about 120 square miles of territory in the past four weeks, about half of what it seized in the previous four weeks, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.\n \n\n   \n  And Russian advances come at great cost. As many as 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, according to an  estimate  in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Pokrovsk area alone since late August, according to Ukraine’s military command. CNN cannot verify battlefield figures.\n \n\n   \n  In the face of these losses, the Russian defense ministry appears to be changing the way it recruits additional personnel. In recent weeks, Russian regions have begun paring back the generous sign-on bonuses used to attract recruits.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has traditionally relied on financial incentives to attract volunteers and avoid another mobilization, but the practice “is likely hitting diminishing returns, which may compel the Kremlin to adopt an alternative approach,” according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia may begin to mobilize members of Russia’s active reserve on a rolling basis to sustain its combat operations in Ukraine,” according to ISW.\n \n\n   \n  For its part, Ukraine is betting on long-range strikes targeting Russian energy infrastructure to persuade the Kremlin to accept negotiations. It has stepped up production of its own cruise missiles, although it has been unable as yet to persuade Trump to  supply Tomahawk missiles .\n \n\n   \n  Since the beginning of the year, successful strikes haved been carried out against 45 facilities in Russia’s fuel and energy sector, according to Syrskyi. Industry analysts estimate that one-fifth of Russia’s refining capacity has been disrupted.\n \n\n   \n  But despite the casualties and damage to Russia’s economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of agreeing to a ceasefire or negotiations with Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,300 days since the full-scale Russian invasion began, as one  expert  puts it, “Ukraine cannot destroy Russia’s war capacity, while Russia appears unable to militarily defeat Ukraine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/uk/police-prince-andrew-giuffre-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:27:00-04:00","title":"Police Looking Into Whether Prince Andrew Enlisted Officer to Dig Up Dirt on Accuser Giuffre","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"London police are investigating whether Prince Andrew, in 2011, asked a bodyguard officer to investigate Virginia Giuffre’s criminal record, raising serious allegations of a smear campaign.

Story by AP\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:27 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  London police are probing whether  Prince Andrew  asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.\n \n\n   \n  The Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear  Giuffre  by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record.\n \n\n   \n  The report by the Mail on Sunday followed Buckingham Palace’s announcement Friday that Andrew agreed to relinquish use of Duke of York and other remaining royal titles after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family welcomed news of the duke giving up his titles but said King Charles III should go further and strip Andrew’s title as prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.\n \n\n   \n  The emails were the last straw for the House of Windsor after years of tawdry headlines about Andrew’s dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.\n \n\n   \n  The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew’s scandals has been ongoing since November 2019 when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a  17-year-old Giuffre , who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his dukedom demotion when emails emerged last week showing he emailed Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.”\n \n\n   \n  The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre’s date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the officer complied with the request. Giuffre’s family said she didn’t have a criminal record.\n \n\n   \n  With that report and Giuffre’s posthumous memoir being published Tuesday, the scandal will not soon evaporate.\n \n\n   \n  British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government’s representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “These are deeply concerning allegations,” Miliband told the BBC. “I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. But if that is correct, that is absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement Friday, Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/kada-scott-missing-suspect-charged-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:10:00-04:00","title":"Police Investigate Disappearance of Philadelphia Woman; Human Remains Found in Shallow Grave Behind Abandoned School","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 23-year-old Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, went missing on October 4, 2025, after disconnecting from her phone and social media at her workplace.

\n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:10 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two weeks after a 23-year-old Philadelphia woman went missing, human remains belonging to an unidentified female have been found in a shallow grave in a heavily wooded area behind an abandoned school, police say.\n \n\n   \n  The remains are now in the care of the medical examiner’s office, which is responsible for determining whether they belong to Kada Scott, Philadelphia Police First Deputy Commissioner John Stanford said at a news conference Saturday,  CNN affiliate WPVI reported. \n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday night, a man was arrested and charged with Scott’s kidnapping – as well as the kidnapping of another woman earlier this year in what police call part of a “pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  Suspect Keon King, 21, also faces a charge of recklessly endangering another person and use of a communication facility, meaning his phone, in the disappearance of Scott, who was last seen at her workplace on the night of October 4, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Tracking phone communications led police to King, Assistant District Attorney Ashley Toczylowski said at a news conference Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. King is the last person, we believe, to be in contact with her and that he was in contact with her when she went offline,” Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  The remains were found after a “very specific” anonymous tip was received overnight and were removed from the scene by late afternoon, Stanford said. The remains indicate the person has been deceased “for some time,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Police had previously searched the area around the abandoned school after receiving an earlier tip and found at least two of Scott’s belongings, but her body was not discovered at that time, according to  CNN affiliate KYW. \n \n\n   \n  “When you know that you’re looking for something but don’t know where someone hid it, it’s not that easy,” Stanford said.\n \n\n   \n  “I know sometimes it seems like the information is not coming fast enough, but we have a job to Miss Scott, we have a job to her family, if this is confirmed that this is her, to ensure that we are doing everything in the proper way to make sure that the individuals are held accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said in a statement on Saturday the city is supporting Scott’s family in any way possible.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no words that I can employ to remove the unimaginable pain and turmoil that the family of Kada Scott is experiencing with the tragic loss of their beloved daughter, sister, and loved one,” Parker said. “I Pray that God will give the family a certain peace that passes all understanding to meet this moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Scott’s mother, Kim Matthews, had told  CNN affiliate WPVI  last week she just wanted her daughter to come home.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been horrible,” Matthews said. “I just need her to come home and be safe. That’s what I fear – she’s not safe.”\n \n\n   \n    What police know about Scott’s suspected kidnapper\n \n\n   \n  When the district attorney’s office joined the investigation into Scott’s kidnapping, prosecutors learned King was charged earlier this year in a case involving accusations of strangulation and kidnapping, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  In that case, King allegedly kidnapped a woman in front of her house, threw her in a car, assaulted her and eventually let her out of the car, Toczylowski said. The case is “domestic in nature” as King and the victim knew each other, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Charges in that case were withdrawn by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office in May because a witness failed to appear in court, Toczylowski said. The office has refiled those charges and King is expected to face preliminary hearings in both kidnapping cases in the coming months, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Video evidence from the alleged incident earlier this year will be played at the preliminary hearing, according to Toczylowski.\n \n\n   \n  CNN is working to determine whether King has retained an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s being really charged with two cases today,” Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a pattern of behavior,” Vanore added.\n \n\n   \n  The Philadelphia Police Department’s homicide division is leading the investigation into Scott’s disappearance with assistance from the FBI’s Violent Crime Task Force.\n \n\n   \n    Tips from the public lead investigators to key evidence\n \n\n   \n  Scott’s family has been desperately waiting for answers and urging anyone with information relating to the case to come forward.\n \n\n   \n  “You never know what little, small, minuscule information may apply to the big picture, the puzzle that might get Kada home,” her father, Kevin Scott, told  WPVI  last week.\n \n\n   \n  During Wednesday’s news conference, police asked for the public’s help in locating a gold 1999 Toyota Camry believed to be linked to King. The same afternoon, they received a tip that led them to the car in an apartment complex parking lot,  WPVI  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities believe Scott may have been in the car at some point. The vehicle has been tracked in multiple locations across the city, officials said Wednesday. The car will be searched after authorities obtain a search warrant, WPVI reported.\n \n\n   \n  Before her disappearance, Scott was in contact with King, who met with her shortly after she left her workplace, police said, citing video and digital evidence. She left her car at work about 20 minutes after she first arrived there and disconnected thereafter, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to find Ms. Scott, figure out where she is, what may have happened to her to cause her to completely disappear from all her items, her phone, her Instagram, social media sites and everywhere else,” Vanore said.\n \n\n   \n  What relationship King and Scott had and how long they knew each other is under investigation, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously, they had a connection. They’re going back and forth and they’ve known each other for a short time but I don’t know how long,” Vanore said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have been tracking several phone numbers involved in Scott’s case and investigating whether any other individuals were involved with the kidnapping. “All roads at this point lead to” King and “that’s what we’re hoping leads us to” Scott, Toczylowski said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/democratic-socialists-zohran-mamdani-movement","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Democratic socialists see their moment in Zohran Mamdani’s rise","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the June 2025 New York City Democratic primary marks the most significant electoral success for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to date, signaling a major shift in the Democratic Party’s ideological direction.

\nUpdated: \n        1:00 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Standing in the lobby of the art deco theater where Zohran Mamdani held a raucous rally last week, just hours after Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas in a ceasefire deal, the organizer was dressed the part: A black T-shirt with the phrase “Land Back” on the top of a circle, “Democratic Socialists of America” on the bottom, a Palestinian flag in the middle.\n \n\n   \n  The pitch was the same to each prospect he sidled up to: “You look like you might want to sign up with the DSA.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s emergence is the biggest electoral achievement the DSA has ever had, well beyond the scattered state legislature and city council seats flipped their way in recent years, or even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going from being a one-time bartender to a potential top presidential contender. Here in Mamdani was a candidate who’d been a regular of their conventions and organizing Zoom calls, toppling an opponent in Andrew Cuomo as proud of his standing with the establishment as his own famous last name.\n \n\n   \n  Amid a larger bipartisan pull toward populism and mounting anger toward corporations and billionaires, DSA members tell CNN their meetings around the country are attracting more people than ever. Socialist chapters in cities have turned mass Signal chats into de facto National Guard and ICE monitoring groups, and affiliated candidates build up volunteer lists and fundraising beyond anything they’ve seen to date.\n \n\n   \n  They insist that moderate Democrats panicking and Republicans salivating over pinning their ideas to progressives at large have it backward, even as the DSA calls for the overthrow of the capitalistic system in favor of more government ownership in addition to abolishing the police, emptying prisons, creating single-payer health insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly believe,” Rhode Island state Rep. David Morales, a 27-year-old DSA member who last month launched his own 2026 primary challenge to the incumbent mayor of Providence, told CNN, “that the future of the Democratic Party has to be a party that’s going to stand up for the working class and be unapologetic about it.”\n \n\n   \n  But there’s a huge catch: The DSA remains tiny and fractured internally.\n \n\n   \n  According to organizers, DSA’s New York City chapter membership has doubled since the end of June. The new number is about 11,000. DSA national leaders refer to their “Mamdani bump,” sizably bigger than 2018’s “AOC bump,” driving their national membership to a record-high 80,000, with 26,000 people joining since January.\n \n\n   \n  By comparison, 545,000 New Yorkers voted for Mamdani in June’s Democratic primary.\n \n\n   \n  That night in the Upper Manhattan theater, only a few in the excited crowd of 3,000 Mamdani supporters signed the organizer’s clipboard, even after Chi Ossé, a city councilman from Brooklyn who is also considering a challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, ended his speech from the stage by declaring, “If you want this movement to continue, you guys got to join New York City DSA!”\n \n\n   \n    Democrats increasingly seem open to socialist ideas\n \n\n   \n  What the crowd did do is sign up for many of Mamdani’s ideas, chanting back his slogans like classic song lyrics and grabbing from a table of buttons: “FREEZE THE RENT” in red, “CHILDCARE FOR ALL” in yellow and “FAST FREE BUSES” in blue. They bounced along with excitement as he declared that he had already won the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, weeks before the general election.\n \n\n   \n  Those opposed to Mamdani’s politics are terrified of how he’s propelling democratic socialism. Other DSA members, though, see not just inspiration, but a model and a warning to the Democratic Party status quo, even as some fret quietly that if Mamdani wins and has problems governing, that could set them back not just in local races, but in trying to position Ocasio-Cortez for a potential 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n   A Gallup poll  from September showed much more support among Democrats for socialist-aligned figures than the current non-socialist leadership, though Republicans viewed socialism much more negatively. But that poll also showed a record low, 54% overall, approval for capitalism, with only 42% of Democrats saying they viewed it positively, as compared to 66% of Democrats who say that they view socialism positively. (Just 14% Republicans and 38% of independents have a positive view of socialism.)\n \n\n   \n  Gustavo Gordillo moved to New York initially to be an artist but has since started working as a union electrician. He liked Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign, but it was only after Trump’s first election that he joined the DSA. Now the co-chair of the New York City chapter, he was involved early with Mamdani’s campaign, helped craft his platform, worked with most of his senior staff, and is now helping organize members to get him over the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  The DSA energy is “a response to a power vacuum in the Democratic Party establishment where very few people could tell you what the Democratic Party stands for,” Gordillo told CNN in a coffee shop on the edge of Chinatown hours before Mamdani’s big rally. “And we’ve seen multiple cycles of establishment Democrats failing to defeat fascists – that that has caused a huge number of working-class people to come to understand that we need a very different kind of political agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  As for helping other campaigns learn from Mamdani’s success, though, Gordillo admitted the group “could be more rigorous.”\n \n\n   \n  Ryan Clancy, a Wisconsin assemblyman and DSA member who started an interview by saying, “I love to talk about socialism,” and joked that he was offended when Republicans called Joe Biden a socialist because the former president wasn’t nearly left enough, encouraged mainstream Democrats to read those numbers as a reason to stop trying to recapture the middle, even in his ultra-swing state.\n \n\n   \n  Voters are “simply demanding more. They don’t want a Hakeem Jeffries, they don’t want a Chuck Schumer, they don’t want people to say they can’t do anything because they’re not in power. That’s bulls**t. They want folks who will fight for them and will use different strategies to do that,” Clancy told CNN. “That idea as a bigger tent expressed as just taking the tent and moving it to the right is really turning off a lot of real progressives and folks on the left who are never going to vote for a Trump but they’re not going to engage with the Democratic Party as it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Factionalism and purity tests\n \n\n   \n  Even as the DSA has moved more toward local races than federal ones, it still faces factionalism and other internal issues.\n \n\n   \n  DSA members across the country tell CNN that Donald Trump and Democrats’ failure to stop him have more to do with their rise than even Sanders, the Vermont senator who came in a close second in both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primary races.\n \n\n   \n  Despite being the godfather of the democratic socialist revival in America, Sanders has never himself been a DSA member and has no plans to join. He likes being an independent and is also no fan of how purist DSA members de-endorse and boot officials they say have betrayed them.\n \n\n   \n  Ocasio-Cortez was one of those the party de-endorsed in 2024 over co-sponsoring an event on combating antisemitism. Then she was the subject of a censure resolution at this summer’s DSA convention for her “tacit support of Zionism in the face of liberal betrayal of international law, and her dogged support for the Democratic Party establishment to the detriment of DSA’s member-led organizing,” even as in the same packet of resolutions obtained by CNN, the organization lauded her “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sanders.\n \n\n   \n  The DSA’s embrace of the Palestinian cause, especially since Oct. 7, has become central to the organization’s identity, from the T-shirt of the organizer recruiting members at the Mamdani event to the group’s “Until Palestinian Liberation” statement on the ceasefire which makes no mention of the word “hostages” but is full of paragraphs decrying Israel.\n \n\n   \n  For some, that’s been an appeal. For others, it’s made the DSA toxic, even if they agree with many of the positions on issues like affordability and healthcare.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s comments on Israel have long been essentially in line with the DSA’s, though he has denounced Hamas and visited synagogues and Jewish groups to affirm that he would fight antisemitism and ensure police protection as needed. But that hasn’t stopped some members from already talking about how they expect to use his potential win as an opening for a wider DSA agenda and demand that he not waver from it at all.\n \n\n   \n    Following in Mamdani’s footsteps\n \n\n   \n  One campaign trying to tap into the same energy and tactics as Mamdani is the Minneapolis mayoral run of Omar Fateh, the state senator who won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor endorsement at its convention over the summer, only to have that support revoked on claimed technicalities shortly after.\n \n\n   \n  Fateh told CNN that the revoked endorsement “supercharged” his campaign, both because of the incident itself and what he said it represented about a party he contends is in sway to rich donors.\n \n\n   \n  “What we don’t want to see is continued tension that extends into the midterms and beyond,” Fateh said. “Democratic leadership has to listen to the folks in the party that are really energizing new voters, energizing young people, bringing on new people to come out, not only to vote, but to volunteer and to spend time and effort helping build out the broad coalition in the party. And because that’s what it’s going to take to win.”\n \n\n   \n  In Seattle, Katie Wilson is waging a strong challenge to the incumbent mayor in November. She’s still waiting on an upcoming meeting of the local DSA to see if she’ll get their endorsement.\n \n\n   \n  Wilson isn’t a DSA member herself. She came up as a founder of the local Transit Riders Union and branched out to wider progressive activism.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a socialist. I’m fine being called a democratic socialist,” Wilson told CNN. “We’re in a moment where most people don’t care that much. People are not that hung up on labels and want to see results on issues that affect their daily lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked how her socialism would define her mayoralty, Wilson said she’d encourage outside organizing to keep up pressure on her administration and community wealth-building models, but said, “it’s really more of a long-term, big picture vision for me.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the next four years, maybe it won’t look that different from a progressive Democrat,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/protestors-voices-no-kings-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"17:43:00Z","title":"Millions Rally Against Trump at 'No Kings' Protests Across the US, Organizers Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, millions of Americans participated in a nationwide 'No Kings' protest movement against President Donald Trump’s policies, with over 7 million people attending rallies across the U.S. The protests, organized by groups like the Indivisible Project and 50501, were driven by fears of democratic erosion, authoritarianism, and attacks on free speech and public services.

Here’s why protesters say they attended \n       \n  By Dalia Faheid, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:43 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  To celebrate her 70th birthday, retired government worker Peggy Cole says she and a friend drove nearly 10 hours from her hometown of Flint, Michigan, to join a protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Cole said she felt compelled to mark the milestone at the large demonstration because it’s a “scary time” for Americans and democracy is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  The event was one of more than  2,700 “No Kings” rallies  held across the country on Saturday, protesting what organizers describe as President Donald Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda. That’s hundreds more events than were planned for the first go-round in June, when about 5 million people across the country  took to the streets  to protest Trump’s administration as he held a  military parade  in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 7 million people showed up for Saturday’s rallies – including more than 100,000 people in New York,  organizers  and officials said. Along with larger events in major cities,  small pockets  of “No Kings” protesters cropped up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and at municipal parks in red and blue states alike.\n \n\n   \n  The  largely peaceful protests  followed a tumultuous summer of mass immigration raids, demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities.\n \n\n   \n  Police in  Portland  and  New York City  reported that the protests concluded with no arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Trouble came later in the day when some individuals targeted protesters: A woman in South Carolina was arrested for brandishing a firearm while driving near a demonstration and a man in Georgia was seen on video taking a protester’s flag and pushing another demonstrator to the ground.\n \n\n   \n  While the  Trump administration  and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is  committed to “nonviolent action”  and had trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation. That became especially important amid  growing political violence  across the country, some organizers said.\n \n\n   \n  Some demonstrators wore yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings,” reads a flyer on  the “No Kings” website .\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters wore costumes, including inflatable chickens, frogs and dinosaurs, which some said emphasized the peaceful nature of the demonstrations. “It’s really hard to call something a war zone, when you look at something and it’s just a block party and people in Halloween costumes,” said a Los Angeles protester who wore a unicorn costume as he danced to music.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters could be heard loudly cheering and chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” They waved American flags along with signs opposing ICE, authoritarianism and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  CNN field teams spoke with attendees at rallies across the country. Here’s what protesters had to say:\n \n\n   \n    ‘We can all save democracy’\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters emphasized the importance of democracy – an institution they fear is eroding with Trump’s attempts to expand executive power.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced,” Joan Press told CNN at a protest in Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  A rally that kicked off the Atlanta protest featured high-profile speakers, including Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.\n \n\n   \n  “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn’t belong to him, our message is very clear,” Warnock later told CNN. “This is not about the people in power, it’s about the power in the people.”\n \n\n   \n  Kimberly Diemert, an organizer and communications director for the Georgia chapter of 50501, a “decentralized” movement that has helped lead the wave of nationwide protests, reminded the crowd about the city’s civil rights legacy.\n \n\n   \n  “Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement as well as democracy … we don’t want to lose that,” Diemert said.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, one demonstrator held a sign reading: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”\n \n\n   \n  The protester, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, said she’s been protesting since the 1960s, but this time feels different.\n \n\n   \n  “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women’s rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that’s being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”\n \n\n   \n  She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy attended the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don’t want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Our free speech is frightening’\n \n\n   \n  Many demonstrators called out what they feel is a threat to freedom of expression in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t seem like we’re able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, said Bobbie Castillo, who traveled hours from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to DC for her first protest ever.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” rallied the crowd at the DC protest, arguing that Trump and his associates “cannot tolerate dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  “To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts. They tried to silence television hosts,” Nye, a former TV host, said.\n \n\n   \n  Participants in smaller cities and towns said they were struck by the size of the turnout Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  In Ashland, Oregon, Joel Lesko said the day was about “joyfully celebrating our love for America, for free speech, for the importance of community and using our voices for diversity and inclusion and democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  After attending a protest in ruby-red Hendersonville, North Carolina, author Lynn Ames told CNN, “If you love this country, saving democracy is a priority no matter where you live, including in small-town America. Maybe especially in small-town America.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration raids and National Guard deployment\n \n\n   \n  Many protesters connected their attendance to the ongoing immigration crackdown and the federal government’s forceful response to anti-ICE protests that first erupted in Los Angeles following local raids. The demonstrations have since spread to numerous other cities, including Chicago, New York City, Dallas and Portland.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s attempts to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-controlled cities – which he argues is necessary to quell violence and support his deportation initiatives – have drawn legal challenges by state and local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators in Los Angeles – where federal immigration raids triggered  massive protests  in June and led to Trump sending in the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes – emphasized rights for immigrants and called for a stop to the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in front of LA’s City Hall, Gilberto Beas told CNN the protest is “a message for ICE to stop doing what they’re doing.”\n \n\n   \n  Maria Rivera Cummings, who was born in Los Angeles and is of Mexican descent, said: “We’re all immigrants and everyone has rights here.”\n \n\n   \n  At a demonstration in DC, Michael Langfeldt said he was protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of the military to US cities.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel like there’s a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he told CNN. “Congress doesn’t do anything about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Hailey, a 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit, told CNN that she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland, who have faced off against federal law enforcement for weeks. Protesters there have donned  inflatable costumes  at rallies outside an ICE facility — in part to dispute Trump’s characterization of the city as “war-ravaged.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, which has been an  epicenter  for the resistance to Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, many carried Mexican flags and signs like “Hands off our Democracy” and “ICE OUT!”\n \n\n   \n  Actor John Cusack, a Chicago resident known for being outspoken about Hollywood and the US government, said the city’s message to the Trump administration is: “Go to hell!”\n \n\n   \n  “No, you can’t put troops on our streets. You can’t create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power,” the actor said, addressing the president.\n \n\n   \n  Dakota Englert, from Coal City, Illinois, said she came to stand up for basic humanity.\n \n\n   \n  “We all bleed the same color … I feel for the people that are being separated from their families, the people that are being hurt, killed,” Englert said.\n \n\n   \n    Cuts to federal programs\n \n\n   \n  Other protesters expressed concerns about cuts to federal programs — particularly health care.    The protests come as the federal government is shut down, with GOP lawmakers and the White House  locked in a standoff  with Democrats over a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  Danielle Guinto, a mother of two, said she worries about the major federal changes to Medicaid and other health-related policies that could impact her children’s health, as well as the rising cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t understand how you can rip food out of people’s mouths, how you can separate, rip people out of their homes,” she told CNN at the Chicago demonstration. “How can you look at a family with fear in their eyes and you’re just going to go take them away?”\n \n\n   \n  Anthony Lee, who works at the Food and Drug Administration and was one of many federal workers who were furloughed following the shutdown, said he came to the demonstration to protect public services. Lee, president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in DC, attended the event with a group of unionized federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been a public servant for over 20 years, and to see the destruction, really, of our government, our public services, over the last several months has been really scary,” Lee said.\n \n\n   \n  Another federal government employee who was furloughed said she joined the DC protest because the Trump administration has affected her livelihood and “demonized” federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  “The elimination of all these jobs are creating mass threats (for people to be able) to keep their home, to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college and the hope of the American dream,” said Monica, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Nee, a 25-year-old social worker from Maryland, told CNN she’s seeing an impact at the psychiatric hospital she works at in Baltimore.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a lot of people who are coming in and they’re unhoused, a lot of people on Medicaid. Everything’s at risk right now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking at the DC protest, Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Trump and his billionaire allies, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is not just about one man’s greed, one man’s corruption or one man’s contempt for the Constitution,” Sanders said. “This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on Earth who, in their insatiable greed, have hijacked our economy and our political system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working families throughout this country.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/nexperia-us-china-car-prices","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00-04:00","title":"US-China trade dispute over a little-known Dutch chipmaker could halt car production and send prices higher","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The trade dispute between the United States and China, centered on the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, threatens global auto production.

over a little-known Dutch chipmaker could halt car production and send prices higher \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Few car buyers have heard of Nexperia. But this Dutch company makes chips that are essential for making cars — and now, it’s at the center of a trade dispute that could shutter global auto plants and send already-record-level car prices even higher.\n \n\n   \n  The dispute is just one part of wider trade tensions between the United States and China. The Nexperia saga began in earnest this past December when the US Commerce Department put Nexperia’s parent company, China-based Wingtech Technologies, on a list of companies facing trade restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Then, this October, China’s Ministry of Commerce banned Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting specific finished components and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia following this move.\n \n\n   \n  The tensions have prompted concerns of possible auto plant shutdowns, since the chips Nexperia makes are critical to the assembly of the cars and trucks in which they’re installed. The fear is that the trade dispute could halt Nexperia’s production of the chips, and it would be difficult to replace them.\n \n\n   \n  When and if auto plants might be forced to halt operations is not clear. But a  similar chip shortage  following the pandemic caused temporary plant shutdowns and the supply of new autos to drop significantly for more than a year. That shortage in turn helped  drive up the price  of both new and used cars.\n \n\n   \n  Vehicles have become more dependent on computer chips, transistors and diodes on everything from adjusting driver’s seats to feeding the proper amount of fuel into engines and providing braking power. Vehicles can’t be completed if those critical components are unavailable.\n \n\n   \n  While Nexperia is little known outside the industry, its site says the company has more than 6,000 products qualified for use in automobiles, and shipments of 110 billion of its products annually. It has 12,500 employees across Europe, Asia and the United States. It said it’s working on business continuity plans and is “confident that a solution will be found.”\n \n\n   \n  But automaker trade groups are less confident and have sounded the alarm  of possible auto plant shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  “If the shipment of automotive chips doesn’t resume – quickly – it’s going to disrupt auto production in the U.S. and many other countries and have a spillover effect in other industries,” John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group for most major automakers, said in a statement. “It’s that significant. We’re urging a quick resolution, so U.S. and global automaking remains on track.”\n \n\n   \n  The European Automobile Manufacturers Association said it would take months to get new supplies of the components its members have been getting from Nexperia, while the supply of its chips is expected to last only weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “Automakers have taken steps over the last years to diversify supply chains but risk cannot be mitigated down to zero. This is a cross-industry issue affecting a large number of suppliers and virtually all of our members,” Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European associations, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We suddenly find ourselves in this alarming situation,” she added. We really need quick and pragmatic solutions from all countries involved.”\n \n\n   \n  Nexperia make about 40% of the automotive chips in the segment of the market that includes transistors and diodes, according to Ian Riches, vice president of the global automotive practice for research firm TechInsights.\n \n\n   \n  Automakers are already being forced to deal with increased costs due to tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration. While many are absorbing the costs so far, Kelley Blue Book came out with an estimate last week that the average US new car price just  topped $50,000  for the first time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/trumps-tariffs-local-coffee-roasters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s Tariffs Are Brewing Trouble for Coffee Roasters","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration’s imposition of high tariffs—50% on Brazil, 20% on Vietnam, and 10% on Colombia—is driving up the cost of imported coffee beans, leading to a 21% year-over-year increase in retail coffee prices.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The rising costs of coffee beans are keeping roasters and their customers on edge.\n \n\n   \n  Retail coffee prices  jumped  nearly 21% in August compared to the same time last year, and the Trump administration’s  tariffs  are partially to blame: In July, Brazil was slapped with one of the highest duties,  at 50% , while Vietnam has  20% tariffs  and Colombia   has 10% tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  America  imports more than 99% of its coffee , according to the National Coffee Association. Most of it comes from Brazil — 30.7% of US coffee imports based on net weight, according to the UN Comtrade Database — Colombia (18.3%) and Vietnam (6.6%).\n \n\n   \n  The average price of regular coffee at restaurants in August was  10 cents more  than the same time last year, according to data from Toast, a restaurant management software provider. The increase brought the average price to $3.52.\n \n\n   \n  Some relief may be on the way. In September, Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska, and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, introduced the bipartisan “No Coffee Tax Act” to exempt coffee products from tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Price hikes may cause some consumers to start brewing their coffee at home, but they will likely continue buying cups from local shops as occasional indulgences.\n \n\n   \n  “(Consumers) may change brands, or they may shop for deals, or perhaps go down in quality — or what they perceive as a quality level — in order to save a little bit of money,” said Erin McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group.\n \n\n   \n    In DC, roasters eat some tariffs, but consumers still feel the pinch\n \n\n   \n  Coffee drinkers in the nation’s capital are seeing more expensive drip   and espressos these days. According to data from Toast, a regular hot coffee in Washington, DC, averaged $4.21 in August, up 4% from last year. And the   average price of a cold brew costs $5.35,   up 3.7% year-over-year.\n \n\n   \n  Swing’s Coffee Roasters, which was founded in 1916 and has three locations in Virginia and Washington, DC,   has been hit with higher-than-usual costs. Owner Mark Warmuth told CNN that Trump’s tariffs caused a “really difficult situation across the board” when combined with environmental and labor factors that make coffee more expensive.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are footing the bill for it,” Warmuth said, adding that “the only loser here is the consumer.”\n \n\n   \n  The cost of a single cup could go up about 10 or 15 cents, Warmuth warned. Even if importing beans costs 50% more, it’s unlikely a single cup would also increase 50%.\n \n\n   \n  DC coffee drinkers may wince at the price, but they aren’t likely   to give up their caffeine fix.\n \n\n   \n  “(Coffee is) kind of considered an affordable luxury. While it might go from $3 a cup to $3.50 a cup, that may not be enough in downtown DC to cause somebody to change their consumption habits,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Chris Vigilante, owner of Vigilante Coffee Company, which has two locations in California and Maryland, said an average pound of coffee   has gone   up from about $4   to   as much as $6. And a 12-ounce bag of beans could increase by 50 cents to $1 for customers, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Vigilante imports much of its coffee from Brazil, and other beans come from countries including Indonesia, Ethiopia and Colombia. Amid  federal layoffs  and other pressures affecting DC residents, he said Vigilante Coffee Company has considered importing coffee from other countries to “diversify our offerings and keep certain price points for our customer base.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite price increases, Vigilante said he’s optimistic that   there are still ways “folks can continue to enjoy great specialty coffee (that) works for their wallet.”\n \n\n   \n  The 50% tariff on top US exporter Brazil, which has seen its coffee bean supply shrink due to a drought, weighs the heaviest on businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Doug Ilg, the owner of Celtic Cup Coffee Roasting in Silver Spring, Maryland, has avoided Brazilian coffee because of the huge tariffs. He doesn’t import coffee himself but buys primarily from third parties and has noticed costs rise in the last eight months.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tariffs “definitely changed things,” Ilg said.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, customers now may pay roughly 63 cents more per pound of beans compared to January because of the additional cost of tariffs this year, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The additional costs also put more pressure on small and medium-sized businesses that invest more upfront, said McLaughlin of the Conference Board.\n \n\n   \n  Joel Finkelstein, the owner of Qualia Coffee, which sells at farmers’ markets around DC, said it’s “really hard” to anticipate where his business will be in a year or two because of factors such as uncertainty about pricing.\n \n\n   \n  “Every small business, unless you’re in a very fortunate position, is constantly assessing whether it makes sense to stay open,” Finkelstein said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/trump-brand-federal-government","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘Brander in chief’ Trump puts his mark on the federal government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During his second term as U.S. president, Donald Trump has aggressively applied business-style branding to the federal government, creating initiatives such as TrumpRx, a drug website; a $1 million 'Trump Gold Card' for immigration; a proposed Trump coin; an F-47 fighter jet; and the 'Rose Garden Club' as a private event space.

Trump puts his mark on the federal government \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made his money by slapping his name on hotels and products. Now he’s doing the same thing to the US government.\n \n\n   \n  There’s  TrumpRx , a website for prescription drugs. The  Trump Gold Card , a high-dollar ticket to citizenship. A  Trump coin . A  Trump fighter jet .\n \n\n   \n  Beginning with his decadeslong career in real estate, Trump has been deeply attuned to branding and marketing — capturing the public’s attention in simple but memorable ways.\n \n\n   \n  In his second term as president, Trump and his team have built upon that skill with a sophisticated operation — the federal government now utilizing the lessons learned at the Trump Organization. And the president has been hands-on, treating his administration like a business to be promoted — a precedent that could be adopted by future campaigns and administrations on both sides of the aisle, but that has raised concerns about the commoditization of the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most significant marketing effort in his political career has been MAGA: “Make America Great Again,” a tagline for his 2016 campaign adopted from a 1980 Ronald Reagan slogan. MAGA has subsequently become the signifier of a much broader political movement — spawning not just hats and T-shirts, but a rallying call and identity.\n \n\n   \n  “What Trump understands is how to capture attention. That is his master stroke,” said Camille Moore, a branding expert and influencer.\n \n\n   \n  “He understands that simplicity and repetition create stickiness. ‘Make America Great Again’ triggers aspirational feelings. These are very simple concepts that anybody can get behind, and that’s what the best branding is based on,” said Moore, who has worked with companies including Saks Fifth Avenue, Netflix and L’Oréal.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his team have sought to take that success beyond the Oval Office. There are the visual manifestations:  a proposed commemorative $1 coin  featuring the president’s likeness, a draft of which has been confirmed by the US Treasury. It’s not clear whether the design will be minted, since it’s against US law to display the image of a sitting president or living former president on a coin.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars have been  spent on banners  with portraits of Trump hung atop three federal buildings in Washington, DC, according to a report from Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.\n \n\n   \n  There are branded products, services and spaces: The president recently unveiled TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer website for discounted drugs set to launch early next year. The name, one White House official said, was the result of a brainstorming session and an effort to reflect Trump’s personal involvement.\n \n\n   \n  “He was not involved in picking the name, but it was not a difficult one to land on. We thought it had a catchy element to it,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, said in the Oval Office earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  A $1 million immigrant visa called the “Trump Gold Card” promises to “unlock life in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Boeing is building a next-generation fighter jet called the “F-47,” a name that was chosen “in consultation with the Secretary of Defense” and honors the World War II-era P-47 aircraft, the founding year of the Air Force, and “the 47th President’s pivotal support for the development of the world’s first sixth-generation fighter,” according to a  statement  from an Air Force spokesperson obtained by Bloomberg News.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also called on US military officials to develop a “ Golden Dome ” defense system, a riff on Israel’s Iron Dome.\n \n\n   \n  And  he’s renovated  one of the White House’s most iconic spaces, the Rose Garden, rebranding it as the “Rose Garden Club” with exclusive dinners for officials, lawmakers and donors. The club has a bespoke logo and has been advertised on his official public schedule. That Trump-fostered exclusivity comes as tours of the People’s House for the general public  have been halted  due to construction on the president’s planned ballroom expansion.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s taking an approach more like Nike or Apple than a politician, and that speaks to why it’s working. … He’s leveraging what businesses that make billions of dollars have proven to do,” Moore said.\n \n\n   \n  But unlike Nike or Apple, the US government isn’t a for-profit business.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has insisted he’s paying for White House renovations himself. At a Wednesday night dinner to thank high-dollar donors and investors for their support for his $200 million ballroom, he said the project had been fully funded. At the same dinner, he held up models for a new triumphal arch he’s involved in planning in Washington, DC — another mark of how he’s imposing his aesthetic on the nation’s capital. (It was not immediately clear how it would be paid for.)\n \n\n   \n  Politicians have long sought to take credit for their accomplishments and to make those actions clear to American voters.\n \n\n   \n  But Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the way Trump has gone about it has raised broader concerns about the president’s efforts to promote himself.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has really supercharged this and made it very much about his name and his identity, and has, in many ways, made the whole government a vehicle to promote him,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump branding does not directly violate any laws, but it does violate long-standing norms, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “When you add all of this up, it has the effect of mobilizing the government for the political benefit of a particular leader — and that has some dangerous implications, even if the specific examples are pretty minor in and of themselves,” Bookbinder said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is the driving force behind many of these efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these have been the president’s ideas, and he is the brander in chief. He’s an expert at marketing. That’s how he made a living and a fortune and created one of the most famous business empires in the world before being elected as president of the United States,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview with CNN. “All of these fun little names are his ideas, and he has a team who’s very much willing to bring them to life.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also used these principles over the years to coin monikers for his political opponents: Low Energy Jeb (Bush), Lyin’ Ted (Cruz), Crooked Hillary (Clinton), and Sleepy Joe (Biden).\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so simple. And it’s painfully memorable when your opponent is trying to be so thoughtful and prescribed. You can’t win against that,” said Moore.\n \n\n   \n  World leaders seeking to cultivate closer ties to Trump have also leaned into branding. A peace agreement between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan has  granted  the US rights to a new corridor: the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.\n \n\n   \n     Second term’s the charm \n \n\n   \n  Officials argue that Trump’s branding efforts have been amplified this term by a staff that has a better grasp on who Trump is.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a big difference this go-round as compared to the previous. He’s a more known entity. And that has made picking up his lead and anticipating what he wants and what he likes and going with it as a branding tool very — not easy — but it’s a skill people have learned how to adopt,” said a White House official granted anonymity to speak freely.\n \n\n   \n  The official said many of the first-term political operatives with decades of expertise weren’t as willing to follow Trump’s less traditional lead.\n \n\n   \n  A second White House official echoed that sentiment: “It’s reflective of how MAGA went from a one-man show to a bigger, well-oiled machine. And the branding reflects how that’s one of the fruits of that investment that he’s made.”\n \n\n   \n  This time around, there has been an emphasis on hiring staff from outside of the Washington bubble who have more diverse backgrounds, including athletics.\n \n\n   \n  “I figured, if someone can make a 2-14 college football team look exciting, then what could they possibly do with legislation? That’s why the videos and a lot of the branded content, it looks different, it looks fresh, it looks like stuff people are use to consuming,” the first   official said.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration made its own attempts to brand its successes, including signage  crediting  then-President Joe Biden with construction projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. But the Biden White House largely struggled to connect the president’s achievements with voters.\n \n\n   \n     Reimagining social media  \n \n\n   \n  The Trump White House has also reimagined its role on social media, launching accounts with coordinated aesthetics that often push the envelope and troll Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike previous administrations, including Trump’s first, there are fewer layers of bureaucracy and approval chains before a post gets published, the first White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  That has prompted blowback on multiple occasions, including a recent racist video  social media post , which appears to be AI-generated, depicting House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache.\n \n\n   \n  But it has also allowed those accounts to be much more active, something that Moore said Democrats could learn from.\n \n\n   \n  “In the social media age, whoever is more nimble, whoever is faster on their feet, whoever understands social media better — who can pivot — is who can win,” she said, adding, “You have to lean into not being polished.”\n \n\n   \n     ‘I was a product’ \n \n\n   \n  Trump’s understanding of branding principles began early in his time at the Trump Organization, the overarching company of namesake hotel and real estate properties.\n \n\n   \n  “Someone recently said that I was a product — I didn’t mind the comment because the product that the name Trump represents is fantastic,” he  wrote  in a foreword to a “Trump University Branding 101” textbook, published in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  He continued, “There is no way we can ignore the power of branding in the world market today — so take the time to establish your brand carefully. Give it your full attention and realize that every detail and dynamic will be consequential.”\n \n\n   \n  Not all of Trump’s branded endeavors have proved successful. There is an entire  Wikipedia  page of Trump businesses that went bankrupt.\n \n\n   \n  Moore compared Trump attaching his name to products and ideas to the name value of a brand like Apple. While the tech company has experienced  recent troubles , consumers are still buying iPhones — “because there’s a confidence to the name of Apple.”\n \n\n   \n  “What we can learn from him is he understands risk and what’s needed to make an impact,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/asia/afghanistan-pakistan-ceasefire-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00-04:00","title":"Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to new ceasefire after more than a week of deadly clashes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following over a week of deadly border clashes, mediated by Qatar and Turkey.

   2:39 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to a new immediate ceasefire during talks in Doha,  Qatar’s foreign ministry said  early Sunday, following more than a week of deadly clashes which continued despite an earlier truce.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries agreed to stop fighting and work toward “lasting peace and stability” in talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement came after Afghanistan’s Taliban leadership accused Pakistan of conducting more airstrikes on its territory, in a continuation of the worst fighting between the two nations since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021.\n \n\n   \n   Violence between the neighbors  along their disputed, 1,600-mile border broke out on October 10 after Afghanistan first accused Pakistan of conducting airstrikes in Kabul and launched retaliatory attacks. Pakistan has long accused Kabul of harboring the Pakistani Taliban militant group (known as the TTP), which its Afghan namesake denies.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the ceasefire agreement, Kabul agreed not to “support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan,” while both sides would “refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” according to a statement from Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The countries had agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire Wednesday, after days of clashes which killed dozens of fighters and civilians on each side. The ceasefire was extended Friday amid plans for mediation, but violence continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the talks Saturday, the Taliban confirmed a high-level delegation led by Afghanistan’s defense minister had departed for Doha. It accused Pakistani forces of conducting airstrikes on civilian areas in the border province of Paktika.\n \n\n   \n  While Afghanistan “reserves the right to respond to these violations, in order to maintain the dignity and integrity of its negotiating team, its forces have been instructed to refrain from undertaking new military operations at this time,” Mujahid said in a statement at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s information minister said that its security forces had struck “verified” camps of Islamist militants along the border, and rejected that it was targeting Afghan civilians.\n \n\n   \n  “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” Attaullah Tarar said in a  post to X Saturday. \n \n\n   \n  Tarar said the militants had attempted to attack Pakistan during the ceasefire period, but that Pakistan had repelled the attacks, killing more than 100 fighters. CNN could not verify the death toll or any targets.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghanistan Cricket Board said eight people, including three cricket players, were killed in a Pakistani attack in Paktika, in a  post to X Friday. \n \n\n   \n  The players had been “targeted during a gathering” after returning home from a friendly cricket match, the board said.\n \n\n   \n  Expressing its “deepest sorrow and grief,” the board announced Afghanistan would pull out of the three-nation T20I cricket tournament next month involving Pakistan, as well as Sri Lanka.\n \n\n   \n  The fighting between the two countries in recent weeks marks the deadliest escalation since the US withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, and could signal a new period of instability for the once-friendly neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan was one of the main backers of the Taliban after its ouster by NATO troops in 2001, and during its subsequent insurgency against the US-backed Afghan government.\n \n\n   \n  But the TTP has re-emerged as one of Pakistan’s biggest national security threats, conducting 600 attacks against Pakistani forces in the past year, according to a recent report by the independent nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED).\n \n\n   \n  Since the recent clashes broke out, at least three dozen civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded in Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)  said Thursday. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/marine-corps-anniversary-jd-vance","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"20:15:00-20:30","title":"Vance celebrates Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary with California event that sparks back-and-forth with Newsom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with a large-scale live-fire demonstration involving fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels, and a towed howitzer.

Gavin Newsom over a live artillery demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp Pendleton demonstration, which the Marines called the largest in a decade in the continental US, involved fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California “due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom, a Democrat who has  frequently sparred  with the Trump administration, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s office disputed the claim that the demonstration was dangerous. William Martin, Vance’s communications director, said in a statement to CNN that the Marine Corps deemed the demonstration “an established and safe practice” and “part of routine training at Camp Pendleton.”\n \n\n   \n  “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” Martin said. “It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.”\n \n\n   \n  In remarks from Camp Pendleton, Vance — the first Marine to serve as vice president — spoke of his time in the military, saying, “I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance  enlisted in the military  after high school, spending four years in the Marines and serving a tour in Iraq in 2005 as a combat correspondent.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks, he also focused on the Trump administration’s  campaign against  “woke” aspects of the military. “It is not our diversity that makes us stronger,” Vance said. “It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green.”\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who took the podium before Vance, made a similar argument.\n \n\n   \n  “I look out at this crowd, I see a lot of different types of faces. The truth is your diversity is not your strength. Never has been,” Hegseth said. “Your strength is in your unity of purpose.”\n \n\n   \n  Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Pentagon has cracked down on diversity initiatives and rolled back efforts made over the last decade attempting to eradicate toxic culture in the military.\n \n\n   \n  During Saturday’s celebration, Vance also delivered a message from the president, acknowledging the  weekslong government shutdown  but placing blame on Democrats — particularly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n \n\n   \n  “I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J. Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he’s proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN has reported, as thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or are working without pay, the Department of Defense is  continuing to pay troops  by using “unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/caribbean-boat-strike-survivors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:29:00.000Z","title":"US Releasing Survivors of Strike on Suspected Drug Vessel to Their Home Countries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US released two survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean to their home countries, Colombia and Ecuador, under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” he posted on Truth Social. “Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea.”\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Perez, 34, was named as the survivor returned to Colombia  in a post on X  from the country’s interior minister Armando Benedetti. Perez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” Benedetti said, adding that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  Benedetti called Perez a “criminal” who “will face justice for drug trafficking.”\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s Ministry of the Interior said Saturday that it received one of the survivors. Authorities told CNN the survivor “is being medically evaluated.” They added that “the corresponding legal process will follow,” but gave no further details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported earlier Saturday that the US was considering releasing the survivors to their home countries. Administration officials were scrambling to determine what to do with the individuals, the first known survivors of the six US military strikes carried out in the Caribbean since September.\n \n\n   \n  The US military detained the survivors after the strike Thursday, marking the first time the Trump administration’s campaign targeting drug traffickers has resulted in the US holding prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s strike was the sixth known strike on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. It came as the US has deployed  scores of military assets  to the Caribbean as it promises further strikes on alleged drug boats, part of the administration’s effort to drive down drug flow into the US and pressure Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian president.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the prisoners, Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues, previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources told CNN the legally dubious situation is why the administration was considering releasing the individuals from US military custody.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. Historically, however, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also argued that the president has broad authorities under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the strikes against what it claims are “narco-terrorists,” but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have questioned that theory. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n    Petro accuses US of violating territory\n \n\n   \n  Late Saturday night, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro accused the United States of killing a fisherman in a separate, earlier, strike on a vessel.\n \n\n   \n  “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote  in a post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing,” he said, adding that the “boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.”\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of Carranza told state-owned TV channel  RTVC Noticias  that he was killed in a US strike on his fishing boat on September 15.\n \n\n   \n  The family said the boat had set off from La Guajira, a peninsula on the northern border with Venezuela, and claimed the boat would not have been out of Colombian waters at the time of the attack, which killed the three people on board, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  “We await explanations from the US government,”  Petro wrote on X .\n \n\n   \n  On September 15, President Trump announced a US strike had  killed  three “confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics,”  in a Truth Social post.  He included video showing a boat sitting idle in the water before exploding into flames. It is the only strike the US has publicly acknowledged on that day.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has asked the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week,  two people briefed by the Pentagon  about the US strikes told CNN that at least one military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months had targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had left from Colombia. The strike the sources identified was on September 19.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Isa Cardona, Max Saltman, Ana María Cañizares, Anabella González and Isabel Tejera contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/world/us-military-build-up-caribbean-trump-pressures-venezuela","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"US Military Positions Troops and Assets in Caribbean as Trump Pressures Venezuela","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean over the past two months, with a major deployment of troops, naval assets, and aircraft including F-35s, drones, and B-52 bombers.

pressures Venezuela \n       \n  By Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has been steadily massing a large number of troops, naval and air assets in the Caribbean over the last two months, conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been shuttered for decades, and  attacking  speedboats carrying suspected drug traffickers from Venezuela and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday, a significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally are also now located in  US Southern Command , the US military’s command responsible for operations in the region, according to a fleet tracker published by the United States Naval Institute’s news portal.\n \n\n   \n  That includes the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean. The US has also deployed at least three MQ-9 reaper drones to the island, according to images captured by Reuters in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004, is now back up and running, according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base. At least one AC-130J Ghostrider, a heavily armed plane capable of providing air support to ground troops, was  photographed  equipped with Hellfire missiles at José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Puerto Rico, which is used by the installation. A separate image,  captured  by a local photographer, appears to show another Ghostrider at the same facility. That airport has been  a staging ground  for US military operations in the region over the last several months.\n \n\n   \n  In a review of open-source flight data, CNN identified over 200 military flights conducted in the Caribbean over the two-month period between August 15 and October 15. The missions were carried out by 83 separate aircraft, including intelligence-gathering planes and tankers used to refuel jets in midair.\n \n\n   \n  Several intelligence gathering assets may also have been diverted from surveillance operations in Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, flight data suggests. Since August 22, three Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft used for signals intelligence gathering crossed the Atlantic into the Caribbean theater.\n \n\n   \n  In early October, “Little Bird” light attack helicopters first identified by the Washington Post and MH-60M Black Hawk helicopters were also spotted conducting training operations off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. The Little Bird is a highly specialized helicopter typically used by US Special Forces for covert missions.\n \n\n   \n  The huge buildup has raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. The administration has said repeatedly that the military presence is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign, but President Donald Trump has also been weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening leader Nicolas Maduro, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Experts generally agree that at this point, the US does not have enough assets or troops in place to launch an incursion to control Venezuela itself.\n \n\n   \n  “The military presence in the Caribbean is too big for just hitting a few speedboats, though it is not big enough for an invasion of Venezuela,” Elliott Abrams, who served as the US envoy to Venezuela during Trump’s first term, told CNN on Thursday. “What’s in the middle, I think, is a pressure campaign, meant to rattle Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The US does have the ability now to conduct strikes inside Venezuela from afar. Trump could order Tomahawk missile strikes, for example, from the guided-missile destroyers, cruiser and submarine stationed in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s enough to cause pain but not to seize terrain,” Peter Singer, a strategist and Senior Fellow at New America focusing on defense issues, told CNN, referring to the military buildup. “We’re not talking about an invasion and occupation force,” Singer said.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuela is not a military powerhouse, but it is a huge country with difficult and varied terrain. Hurricane season is not over, and the US has not fought a tropical war in two generations, a former US official with deep experience in the region said. And at this moment, the US does not dominate the airspace over Venezuela, the former official noted. Venezuela has S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-launched air defense systems, and F-16 fighter jets.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abrams, Singer said he believes “so much at this stage is about signaling and pressuring” Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, the US flew B-52 bombers near Venezuela’s coast for four hours on Wednesday, in what appeared to be a show of force. At their closest point, the bombers reached 48 miles from Los Roques, a small Venezuelan island archipelago of a few thousand residents.\n \n\n   \n  The bombers remained in a part of Venezuela’s flight information region, or FIR, that is international airspace, but controlled by the country’s aviation authority. Venezuela’s FIR extends far beyond the country’s airspace.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has also conducted several training missions in that area in recent weeks, including  live-fire training  and flight operations in the waters near Venezuela earlier this month, and at least five flights of a T-38 jet — used for pilot training — in the Caribbean since September 22, according to open-source flight data.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Katie Bo Lillis, Thomas Bordeaux, Isa Cardona and Isa Soares contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/entertainment/israel-palestine-boycott-javier-bardem","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"There’s a ceasefire — but Hollywood’s fight over Israel and Gaza still rages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hollywood remains deeply divided, with celebrities taking strong opposing stances.

Mark Ruffalo, for one, reposted a message this week from Film Workers for Palestine that said, “We share in the relief of Palestinians in Gaza that Israel’s relentless slaughter may be coming to an end.” A week ago, he also reposted a note from the group Artists4Ceasefire that expressed hope about the ceasefire and for the return of hostages to Israel. He was among those criticized for not marking the return of the Israeli hostages since they were released earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Cynthia Nixon, similarly, had posted a message to “Free all the hostages and Free Palestine” on October 9, but pro-Israel activists said that she didn’t acknowledge the return of Israeli civilian hostages. These activists also suggested that none of these celebrities spoke up about Hamas executing Palestinians in the streets of Gaza this week.\n \n\n   \n  The execution-style killings of Palestinians in Gaza has a potential to trigger an unraveling of the ceasefire. President Donald  Trump warned  Hamas this week that “We will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” in  an escalation of rhetoric  during this brittle moment.\n \n\n   \n  “Celebrities that have been so outspoken and so engaged with this conflict and calling out Israel almost on a daily basis have all gone quiet about the brutal murder of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire began,” says Hen Mazzig, senior fellow at the pro-Israel Tel Aviv institute, which utilizes influencers online to enact opinion change about both Jews and Israel. He made the claim that these activists didn’t care about Palestinians but were only using the cause to attack Israel, saying that “the mask was off”: “We know exactly what they stand for and we know exactly what it was all about — I think it’s clear it was about using their platform to attack Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Bardem — who has been one of Hollywood’s biggest critics of Israel and most passionate advocates for Palestinians — spoke to CNN about the executions specifically.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, I am completely against the execution of anyone including Palestinians by Hamas. It is an atrocious act of violence,” Bardem said in a statement, speaking on the matter for the first time. “Everyone deserves a fair trial where the accusations are shown and proven, and only then be rightfully accountable by a fair law that obviously does not include execution.”\n \n\n   \n    The boycott that will pit studios and talent against each other\n \n\n   \n  Bardem is one of nearly 4,000 Hollywood figures who signed a pledge last month to boycott Israeli film institutions. The pledge said that Israel’s filmmaking industry is “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”\n \n\n   \n  On the Emmys red carpet last month, Bardem wore a keffiyeh and did a series of interviews to support the people of Palestine, telling   Variety , “I cannot work with somebody that justifies or supports the genocide. That’s as simple as that. And we shouldn’t be able to do that, in this industry or any other industry.”\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli film boycott, organized last month by Film Workers for Palestine, drew support from a substantial number of A-listers, including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Ayo Edebiri, Ilana Glazer, Susan Sarandon, Ruffalo, Nixon and Bardem.  (A representative for Nixon did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Ruffalo’s representative said he was unavailable and in production overseas.)\n \n\n   \n  The boycott prompted an open letter from a different group of Hollywood artists, including Liev Schreiber, Gene Simmons, Sharon Osbourne, Jerry O’Connell, Howie Mandel, Mayim Bialik and Messing who denounced the call to stop working with Israeli film institutions over the war in Gaza, stating that the letter promotes “censorship and the erasure of art.”\n \n\n   \n  Paramount and Warner Bros. – which are both under the leadership of pro-Israel CEOs in David Ellison and David Zaslav, respectively – have issued statements taking a clear stand against the Israel film boycott, in a strong and rare public position from two major Hollywood studios. (Warner Bros. shares the same parent company as CNN.)\n \n\n   \n  Now, they will have to contend with thousands of artists in the creative community who disagree with their company’s stance.\n \n\n   \n  Bardem told CNN that the Film Workers for Palestine pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions is about holding institutions accountable.\n \n\n   \n  “I want this to be very clear. We do not discriminate against any person based on their nationality, race, religion, or gender,” Bardem told CNN. “We of course believe discrimination of any kind is wrong and do not support that and have continued to reiterate this. We support holding companies and institutions all over the world accountable, not individuals, for their complicity and participation in the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the illegal settlement of the West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  A representative for Artists4Ceasefire – which was the first advocacy group to galvanize prominent celebrities to call for a ceasefire after October 7, 2023 – declined to participate in an interview with CNN about next steps for the movement now that a ceasefire deal has been reached, but provided a statement about their mission of achieving a permanent ceasefire. (The representative also declined to identify who runs the organization, saying that “we are a collective of artists and advocates.”)\n \n\n   \n  That group is behind the red pins that many celebrities – from Ruffalo to comedian Ramy Youssef to singer Billie Eilish – wore on the Oscars red carpet, symbolizing solidarity with Palestinian people. Roughly 500 celebrities and Hollywood artists signed the Artists4Ceasefire petition in 2023; dozens of industry A-listers signed an  Artists4Ceasefire letter  addressed to then-President Biden, urging the White House for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Our call remains the same as it has been since October 2023: a permanent ceasefire, a return of all hostages, and the immediate, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza,” said the Artists4Ceasefire representative in a statement. “This is the beginning of what is required for healing, rebuilding and a just and lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches to see if a ceasefire will hold and bring peace, Hollywood, usually more unified on social justice issues, will continue to wrestle both in public and in private.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a ceasefire, but I would say that it is far from resolved,” said Tatiana Siegel, executive editor of film and media at Variety. “I’ve talked to a lot of studio executives who tell me that they are very aware of who signed what and are not eager to work with people that they strongly disagree with. This was a situation where everyone in Hollywood became a Middle Eastern expert overnight and was chiming in with their opinions one way or another on social media.”\n \n\n   \n  Already over the past two years, stars have been dropped from agencies and fired from franchises over this conflict. “A lot of people feel angry about what they saw,” said Siegel. “Where do we go from here?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/middleeast/how-western-sanctions-iran-hurt-middle-class-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00Z","title":"How Western sanctions on Iran have hurt the same middle class that drives reform","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Western sanctions on Iran, particularly since 2012, have severely damaged the country’s middle class — a historically reform-minded and economically stable demographic that once drove political change and social development.

that drives reform \n       \n  By Leila Gharagozlou, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Iranian middle class, long a force of political moderation, stability, economic growth, and the base of the country’s reform movement, is shrinking fast under the pressure of Western sanctions, researchers say. Left in its wake are rising societal resentments and an ever-increasing wealth gap.\n \n\n   \n  A study published in the  European Journal of Political Economy  has used an innovative method to investigate the true extent and damage of Western sanctions on Iran since 2012 and how they have resulted in a dwindling middle class, leaving more Iranians to struggle on low incomes as a small elite prospers.\n \n\n   \n  Resentment between the social classes is clear when speaking with Iranians, and the frustration felt by a young, highly educated population is more palpable than ever. Iran’s current unemployment rate is 7.4% according to the Statistical Center of Iran, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) puts the  rate at 9.2%  for 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “You can feel the difference between rich and poor more than ever; everything has become expensive, whether it’s bread or chicken. Meanwhile, you see people in luxury coffee shops, luxury restaurants,” said Elham, a schoolteacher in Tehran who is trying to make ends meet. Elham asked to be identified by her first name due to security concerns, as did other Iranians in the country who spoke with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The minimum wage in Iran is approximately 104 million rials, about $110 per month. The prices of basic goods have risen, with an annual inflation rate of 42.4%, according to October figures from the IMF. In South Tehran, the price of basic household staples like rice has nearly quadrupled, according to shopkeepers and residents. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, wealthy residents attend exclusive Pilates studios charging 17 million rials.\n \n\n   \n  The recent conflict with Israel highlighted the wealth gap. While the Israeli bombing of Iran’s capital targeted both wealthy and less well-off areas of Tehran, residents with means and access to extra fuel amid a fuel shortage were able to  flee the city  and even the country. One resident, Reza, 36, said: “I couldn’t leave Tehran, even if I wanted to. I couldn’t get fuel to drive anywhere, and I can’t afford the trip to Armenia or Turkey.”\n \n\n   \n  The growing wealth gap and inequality are like a festering wound and Mohammad Reza Farzanegan, a professor of the economics of the Middle East at the University of Marburg in Germany and one of the authors of the new study, told CNN the gap could lead to deep social resentment and damage national unity in the country of around 92 million.\n \n\n   \n  While the Iranian elite continue to reap the benefits of the current system, he said, “the rest of society is left to compete for declining resources in a diminishing economy. The result is a society with increasing inequality and perception of inequality.” The perception of inequality, he added, is even more dangerous to societal stability than the true inequality that exists.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have long been billed by the West as a humane tool in the foreign policy and diplomatic arsenal, often described by proponents as being surgical and precise, targeting governments and leaders with minimal civilian impact. However, by studying Iran, one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world, the researchers have found that not only have sanctions decimated the economy, they have also punished the segment of the Iranian population which has historically pushed for reforms and change, the middle class.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan and his co-author, Nader Habibi, a professor of economics at Brandeis University in the United States, used a synthetic control method to create a data-driven, non-sanctioned “twin” of Iran and compare that twin to the real, sanctioned Iran. The results reveal the significant humanitarian, societal, and political impact of this economic tool on the general population.\n \n\n   \n  According to the study, from 2012-2019, when comparing the real Iran and the non-sanctioned “twin,” researchers found that, were it not for sanctions, the Iranian middle class would have expanded by 17%. By 2019, the middle class of the real Iran was 28% smaller than it should have been, according to their modeling. A  separate study  published in the book “How Sanctions Work” looked at household data in Iran and estimated that roughly 9 million people lost middle-class status between 2011 and 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Farzanegan believes Iran provides a unique case study. Firstly, the scale and intensity of the sanctions imposed on it are unique. While the country has faced sanctions on and off since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when the Western-installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown, paving the way for clerical rule, Iran was hit with the strictest sanctions in modern history in 2012 under the Obama administration. A short respite came after the signing of the nuclear deal known as the JCPOA in 2015, but Iran was once again sanctioned by President Donald Trump in 2018, through his “maximum pressure” policy.\n \n\n   \n  Secondly, Iran holds a unique position among sanctioned countries due to its demographics, which includes a “large, educated and previously growing middle class,” Farzanegan said. The Western sanctions, he explained, have “attacked the very heart of Iran’s modern social structure.”\n \n\n   \n    Century in the making\n \n\n   \n  The creation of the Iranian middle class – made up of civil servants, teachers and professionals – has been a century in the making, with efforts over the last 45 years focused on lifting poor, marginalized communities through education and opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  From the 1990s, after the Iran-Iraq war of the previous decade, the Iranian middle class saw increased growth through 2012.  Beyond its role in politics, the middle class in Iran has also been a generator of entrepreneurship, giving birth to some of its most successful startups, like Snapp, Iran’s answer to Uber, or Digikala, the Iranian equivalent of Amazon.  But many young Iranians say they see few opportunities now.\n \n\n   \n  “I spend a lot of time wondering if I should leave, thinking about where I should go, and where I can even get a visa. I drive Snapp, and I do courier services at the moment, but it is still a struggle. I’m not sure what else to do with so few jobs,” said Ali, a 34-year-old based in Tehran.\n \n\n   \n  Ali, like many Iranians, has fallen on hard times. Educated as a computer engineer, he has struggled to find work in his field. His concerns have only grown since Israel and the United States carried out strikes in Iran in June, targeting its nuclear program, and as diplomatic efforts between the US and Iran have fizzled, entrenching sanctions further.\n \n\n   \n  The political damage from years of sanctions can already be seen within Iranian society, analysts say. “Sanctions have weakened independent economic actors while strengthening state-linked and security-sector players like the IRGC and bonyads,” said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the US-based Center for International Policy think tank. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is one of the most powerful branches of the Iranian military, also holding political, ideological and economic power, and bonyads are government-backed charitable trusts.\n \n\n   \n  “By channeling resources to actors who benefit from isolation, sanctions have tilted the balance toward factions built on control and confrontation, entrenching hardliner power,” Toossi said.\n \n\n   \n    Changed face of protest\n \n\n   \n  The middle class is historically a force of moderation and stability in Iran, bridging the gaps in society and counteracting extremes.  “The middle classes have the economic security and education to advocate for civil liberties and political accountability,” said Farzanegan. “Our  research  shows that sanctions have systematically taken this security. When people are busy with daily survival, their capacity for organized, long-term political engagement is severely diminished.”\n \n\n   \n  The Iranian middle class has long been the backbone of the reform movement, and the driver of many of Iran’s protest movements over the decades. It has been the base for reformist leaders like President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 and now President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n \n\n   \n  With a reduced middle class, Farzanegan warns that one begins to see a small, elite group profiting off and simultaneously insulated from sanctions at the top, and, at the bottom, what he calls “the new poor” – millions of Iranians pushed down the socio-economic ladder. “Sanctions, combined with corruption, function like Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the middle class and poor to enrich the powerful,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  This doesn’t fully destroy political engagement but changes it. “The political mantle has shifted from a middle-class demand for rights and reforms to a working-class cry for survival and bread,” says Farzanegan.\n \n\n   \n  This shift can be seen in working-class-led protests like the November 2019 fuel protests. While those types of protests are an important force, Farzanegan said, they are “more fragmented and focused on short-term economic grievances, making them both volatile and vulnerable to state repression.”\n \n\n   \n  Another issue is that pushing people into poverty increases their reliance on government services. In Iran, this means relying on IRGC-connected social services that have themselves been hamstrung by sanctions, creating an “unsustainable trap,” Farzanegan said.\n \n\n   \n  Sanctions have crippled the government’s primary source of revenue, oil exports, limiting the state’s ability to provide for millions of impoverished Iranians through social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Where Iran goes from here is unclear, even as concerns of renewed conflict linger.  Rebuilding a middle class, while possible, is a “generational challenge,” said Farzanegan. “It is not a switch that can be flipped back on, even if all sanctions were lifted tomorrow.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/us/remigrate-dhs-explained","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"DHS issued a call to ‘remigrate.’ Here’s the history of the term often associated with far-right groups","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sparked widespread backlash by posting a social media message urging immigrants to 'remigrate' and use a self-deportation app. Experts warn that the term 'remigrate' has a long and troubling history, originating with Nazi antisemitic policies such as the Madagascar Plan, and has since been embraced by far-right movements as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing under the 'Great Replacement Theory.'

groups \n       \n  By Chelsea Bailey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A nine-letter  social media post  was all it took for the Department of Homeland Security to spark a torrent of backlash online this week, drawing the ire of politicians and prompting comparisons to Europe’s far right.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday afternoon, DHS posted a declaration on X for immigrants to “remigrate,” threading a link to the agency’s self-deportation app.\n \n\n   \n  At first glance, the post could be seen as a straightforward reference to the Trump administration’s long-standing immigration policies, which have called for immigrants to “voluntarily self-deport” back to their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  But experts who study and monitor extremism and the far right told CNN they’d urge caution when invoking the word, which has historic roots, including Nazi ideology and, more recently, a violent conspiracy theory that’s inspired terrorist attacks in the US and abroad.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know:\n \n\n   \n    A brief, dark history of a loaded word\n \n\n   \n  Extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss was researching Nazi iconography for her  2019 book  when she said she came across an image that made her pause.\n \n\n   \n  The picture – emblazoned on a T-shirt – showed Jewish people being loaded onto a ship bound for Madagascar. It was captioned, “Have a nice trip,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And it was a reference to the Nazis’ “ Madagascar Plan .”\n \n\n   \n  In the late 1930s, “before the concentration camps and gas chambers … there was a solution to remigrate Jews to Madagascar,” Miller-Idriss explained.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Adolf Hitler weighed multiple remigration policies and other antisemitic proposals before arriving at his final, devastating solution to the  “Jewish Question”  – the Holocaust.\n \n\n   \n  And although the world vowed “never again,” Miller-Idriss said decades later, neo-Nazis were proudly wearing references to the antisemitic remigration proposal on T-shirts.\n \n\n   \n  Remigration is “this idea that you should send people ‘who don’t belong in this country’ to another place,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  While remigration isn’t often used in daily conversation, Miller-Idriss told CNN in recent years the concept has found a champion in a new far-right conspiracy: The Great Replacement Theory.\n \n\n   \n  The far right believes “any particular state that has a White majority population that wants to retain it – or restore it – you would have to get rid of people of color,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  “And you either do that violently … or by remigrating them.”\n \n\n   \n    A dubious solution to a racist conspiracy\n \n\n   \n  Although many have likely never heard of the replacement theory, we’ve all lived through its violent consequences.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2011, a Norwegian neo-Nazi  went on a rampage , detonating a bomb in Oslo, Norway, before opening fire at a Labour Party youth camp on nearby Utoya Island.\n \n\n   \n  He killed 77 people. In the aftermath, experts began wading through the 1,500-page manifesto the terrorist reportedly posted online just before the attack.\n \n\n   \n  They found it was riddled with references to  the replacement theory,  a once-fringe conspiracy that falsely argues a shadowy cabal is conspiring to eradicate the White European population by replacing them with non-European immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  Although the attack was widely condemned, experts told CNN the conspiracy ultimately found  a new foothold  amid the rise of far-right movements in Europe and the United States.\n \n\n   \n  And as it spread, terrorist attacks followed: at a  mosque  in Christchurch, New Zealand. At a  Walmart in El Paso, Texas . And, most recently, at a  grocery store  in Buffalo, New York.\n \n\n   \n  Each attack, Miller-Idriss said, was inspired in some way by the replacement conspiracy.\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, as the ethnonationalist Identitarian movement gained traction in the mid-2010s, far-right politicians began touting what had historically been a more palatable solution to the so-called replacement theory: the large-scale deportation of non-Europeans.\n \n\n   \n  “The more political, nonviolent response (to the conspiracy theory) is to advocate for remigration policies – very, very large scale deportation of non-Europeans from the countries that they live in,” said Jakob Guhl, director of policy, research and counterterrorism for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n \n\n   \n  “The concept of remigration has been so successful because it’s not 100% clear what people mean by it.”\n \n\n   \n  On one end of the spectrum, Guhl said, there are politicians who are advocating for returning those who no longer have a legal right to remain in a country. But on the other, more extreme end, he said the conversation quickly turns to maintaining a country’s White so-called ethnic purity.\n \n\n   \n  The ambiguity “really allows the far right to push this term and have people kind of interpret it in the way they prefer,” Guhl said.\n \n\n   \n  Across Europe, nationalist and far-right groups have successfully pushed “remigration” to the forefront through panels, podcasts, political campaigns and posts on social media, Guhl said.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s really important to understand that it’s language that has been strategically used, and that has sort of been intentionally kept a little bit vague in order for very extreme nationalist positions to enter the mainstream,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for far-right groups like AFG in Germany and the National Rally in France, he said, “this is really about creating greater ethnic homogeneity, creating Whiter countries.”\n \n\n   \n    Remigration in action\n \n\n   \n  CNN reporter Barbie Latza Nadeau has spent years covering immigration and tracing the rise of the far right in Italian politics.\n \n\n   \n  The election of  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , in 2022, marked the ascension of such right-wing policies in Italy and her administration has since ushered in a dramatic crackdown on immigration and asylum-seekers through remigration.\n \n\n   \n  “Italy is the Texas and California of the United States, in terms of irregular migration, and the Mediterranean Sea is the Rio Grande,” Latza Nadeau said.\n \n\n   \n  Migrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa and try to enter Europe to claim asylum along the Italian coast. But their boats are often met with tragedy, as many become  stranded  or  capsize  in the rough seas,  prompting rescue  from the Italian Coast Guard.\n \n\n   \n  According to the  Dublin Regulation , if a migrant arrives in a European Union member state, the first country where they arrive must care for them and process their cases. But in 2023, Meloni’s government  struck an agreement  with Albania – a non-EU country – to build controversial migrant detention centers and subvert the EU agreement.\n \n\n   \n  The following year Italy  began deporting asylum-seekers  there to await processing. The remigration policy has been  beset by legal challenges  and in August, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled while the facilities in Albania could remain open, Italy needed to ensure asylum-seekers aren’t being remigrated to dangerous situations in their home countries.\n \n\n   \n  But the centers aren’t the only mechanism the Italian government has to remigrate immigrants and asylum-seekers. Being born in Italy does not automatically make you a citizen which, Latza Nadeau said, makes it easier for the country to target, detain and deport migrants – and their families – back to their country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Even though her children were born in Italy to an American journalist who legally has a right to work and live in the country, Latza Nadeau said her kids could face deportation to the US, a country they’ve never really known.\n \n\n   \n  “Remigration means in Italy that anyone – even if your kids are born here, even if you’re totally ‘legal’ – can send your kids away,” she said. “My kids have to have better documents than almost anyone I know to stay in Italy.”\n \n\n   \n  This spring, tensions flared in Milan as far-right activists gathered in the city to hold a Remigration Summit. The event was met with protests and demonstrators clashed with police.\n \n\n   \n  Latza Nadeau said for many in Europe today, remigration has been seen as just another outgrowth of the push for immigration reform, but historically the policy has been used as a tool for ethnic cleansing.\n \n\n   \n  “Remigration in the context of Europe, you don’t have to go back very far to figure out that this started in a time when Mussolini remigrated the Roma people … or sending Jewish people to the concentration camps,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “These were words that were used during that period of time, and reimagined now.”\n \n\n   \n    More than semantics\n \n\n   \n  In April, the  State Department proposed  shifting the responsibilities of several offices in the agency from refugee support toward creating offices that would support “the Administration’s efforts to return illegal aliens to their country of origin.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the proposal, one of the new offices would be called the “Office of Remigration.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked DHS to further explain the policies and context behind Tuesday’s controversial social media post. In response, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin questioned the reporter’s ability to understand English.\n \n\n   \n  “Is the English language too difficult for you?” McLaughlin wrote in email, before citing the Collins English Dictionary’s definition of the verb “remigrate.”\n \n\n   \n  “We urge all illegal aliens to remigrate and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  But when pressed to respond to CNN’s initial inquiry about the controversy over the post – and its far-right connotations – McLaughlin did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  “The best-case scenario is that’s not what DHS intends, and in that case, they should choose a different word because (remigrate) is a signal,” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s read as a dog whistle by the extreme right, by White supremacists who will see it that way.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, both Miller-Idriss and Guhl told CNN they’re more focused on whether far-right extremists – in the US and abroad – will view the DHS post as a call to action.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m more concerned with, ‘Does it signal legitimation to groups that promote violent types of ethnic cleansing, or that believe that ethnic cleansing through violence is the right path forward for this country,’” Miller-Idriss said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-body-from-gaza-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"19:27:00Z","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Tenth Hostage as Delicate Truce Enters Second Week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the body of Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, a 75-year-old man killed in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, as the tenth deceased hostage returned from Gaza under the ceasefire agreement.

Yosef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:27 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a tenth deceased hostage returned to Israel from Gaza under the recent ceasefire deal has been identified as the truce entered a second week despite facing a number of tests and with the next steps unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, of blessed memory,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz, or village, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the identity of Margalit, who was 75 at the time he was killed in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 two years ago. His body was later taken to Gaza, the Israeli military said.\n \n\n   \n  “We will always remember him as a kind-hearted man whose world was filled with family, kibbutz, nature, and animals,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  There are now 18 deceased hostages left in Gaza following the return of Margalit’s body.\n \n\n   \n  Frustration has  intensified  in Israel over the delay in returning the bodies of remaining hostages, a condition outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that went into effect last week.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Israel  believes  that Hamas does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter, and Israel’s Foreign Minister has accused Hamas of trying to use them as bargaining chips.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas’ armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, has previously called for help, saying on Wednesday that “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies of the remaining hostages.\n \n\n   \n  In that statement, al-Qassam Brigades said it has “abided by what was agreed upon and has handed over all the living captives in its possession and the corpses it could access.”\n \n\n   \n    Ceasefire holds despite killings\n \n\n   \n  For the moment, both sides appear to believe the ceasefire in Gaza is holding though not without coming under strain from the failure of Hamas to return all the bodies, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and continued, if isolated, incidents of killings of Palestinians in Israeli strikes.\n \n\n   \n  A Palestinian family travelling back to their home in the north of the Gaza were killed by the Israeli military on Friday after their vehicle crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The vehicle was carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, Basal said. After coordinating with the United Nations, Gaza’s civil defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the civil defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire with such killings, but no retaliatory action was taken as of Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has also allowed more aid to enter in recent days but aid groups are calling for the opening of more crossings to improve deliveries.\n \n\n   \n  The World Food Programme said on Friday that it has not been able to bring enough food into Gaza because conditions are “extremely difficult”, including communities being on the move, the parlous road conditions, and the fact only two border crossings are open.\n \n\n   \n  The Rafah border crossing, a key gateway that connects Gaza to Egypt, has yet to open.\n \n\n   \n  The crossing was set to open to civilian traffic in both directions as part of the ceasefire agreement, but Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said on Thursday that the date of the opening “will be announced at a later stage.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s Foreign Minister said last week it could open on Sunday. But on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said it would remain closed until further notice, adding that the crossing’s opening would be subject to Hamas meeting the terms of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  “Its opening will be considered depending on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline,” a statement from his office said.\n \n\n   \n    Phase Two\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations on the crucial next stages of the ceasefire deal began in Egypt last week, an Israeli source and a regional official told CNN, with the talks focusing on the demilitarization of Gaza, governance of the strip and the formation of an international force to help secure the enclave after two years of war.\n \n\n   \n  A 20-point plan presented by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza states that the enclave will be administered by a non-political technocratic group of Palestinians and an overseeing body called the ‘Board of Peace’ - set to be chaired by United States President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  An International Stabilization Force (ISF) made up of troops from several countries will be constructed to secure the strip, according to the plan.\n \n\n   \n  But even though Hamas dispatched its chief negotiator to Cairo for discussions over the Palestinian committee set to govern Gaza, the militant group remains vague over its disarmament and transfer of power.\n \n\n   \n  And countries set to join the International Stabilization Force are still negotiating its structure, with some asking for a mandate from the UN Security Council before joining.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Lauren Izso contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/how-qatar-became-trumps-key-ally-in-his-middle-east-peace-efforts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00Z","title":"How Qatar Became Trump’s Key Ally in His Middle East Peace Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Donald Trump’s second term, Qatar emerged as a pivotal diplomatic ally, transforming from a target of criticism during the 2017 Gulf blockade to a central mediator in high-stakes Middle East negotiations.

East peace efforts \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As he flew to the Middle East to celebrate his diplomatic victory on a  ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza,  President Donald Trump heaped praise on one ally in particular: Qatar.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar was a tremendous help to getting this done. I hope people can realize that,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “It was very tough and very dangerous for Qatar. They were very brave.”\n \n\n   \n  The Gulf nation has long been a broker in diplomatic negotiations but its key role as mediator, along with Egypt, in the Gaza talks further cemented its stature in the eyes of the US president.\n \n\n   \n  In a sign of the warm relationship within his first 10 months in office, Trump  received a plane  meant to be used as Air Force One from Doha and the president signed an executive order giving Qatar an unprecedented bilateral defense pact with the US following an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in its capital Doha.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s effusive praise was a far cry from his stance on Qatar in the early months of his first term, when he accused the nation of funding terrorism in the region.\n \n\n   \n  US officials, regional sources, and experts say the vastly improved relations are due to the development of personal relations between Trump and members of his close inner circle and Qatari leaders, a steady campaign of lobbying, and the nation’s ability to deliver as an effective interlocutor between the US and a vast number of players including the Taliban, the Houthis, Iran and Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t recall any country that’s had the turnaround that Qatar has,” said Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.\n \n\n   \n    ‘The Qataris were critical’\n \n\n   \n  Trump signaled the importance of his relationship with Qatar to his second term by including the small nation on the first overseas trip after his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump immediately tapped into the relationships that had developed during his first term and had been strengthened by business deals that his friends and family had done with Qatar in recent years, explained current US officials and regional diplomats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump family’s business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president’s first term in office, a  CNN tally of the deals  found in May. Earlier this year, the Trump Organization announced plans for a Trump-branded golf resort in Qatar that was supported by a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund.\n \n\n   \n  The Qatari Emir also maintained direct contact with Trump during his years out of office, which is something not all other world leaders did, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  The familiarity made for productive, trustworthy and blunt interactions, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman noted that Trump “wants to be seen as this great dealmaker” and win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Qatar is seen as being able to “help him get done on the international stage what he wants to get done.”\n \n\n   \n  Qatar helped to draft the 21-point plan for peace in Gaza that Witkoff initially shared with Arab and Muslin nations in New York, which led to pivotal discussions that laid the groundwork for the hostage release and ceasefire which came just weeks later, a source said.\n \n\n   \n  And then, when last week’s high-stakes negotiations occurred in Egypt, Trump’s top envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner met privately with Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya and a senior Qatari official, a meeting which led to a breakthrough in negotiations, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It came as Hamas was looking for reassurances that Israelis would not reignite the war after the Israeli hostages held by the group were released.\n \n\n   \n  The Qataris sought out Witkoff and Kushner for the meeting, first reported by Axios, which was pivotal in securing the agreement to release hostages and put a ceasefire into effect later that night.\n \n\n   \n  “Plain and simple, that agreement would not have been accomplished without the Qataris,” said an administration official. “The Qataris were critical in facilitating discussions with Hamas that were crucial in securing a final agreement in Egypt.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump spoke highly of the Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani when they signed an agreement aimed at regional peace alongside other regional leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “His Highness Sheikh Tamim is respected by everybody. He’s respected by everybody, and in the most positive way. Not only because of power, because of his heart. He’s got a tremendous heart and he’s a great leader, and his country loves him,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Qatar remains a controversial topic within Trump’s orbit, with some key allies of the president voicing deep concerns about the country’s growing influence.\n \n\n   \n  Among the loudest critics of Qatar is far-right activist Laura Loomer, an influential figure within the administration who slammed the announcement Qatar would be allowed to build an Air Force training facility in Idaho last week.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s Republican allies in Congress have also been left in the dark, at times, about Qatar’s dealings with the administration, even on matters that directly impact the states they represent.\n \n\n   \n  Idaho’s entire GOP-led congressional delegation, which includes chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, and its Republican Governor, only learned that the administration had formally agreed the Air Force training deal when it was announced publicly by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar’s relationship with the Trump administration was also tested earlier this year when the US did not notify them before Israel carried out a military strike against Hamas leaders in Doha. US officials scrambled to contain the potential fallout from the strike by reassuring Qatar it, too, was left in the dark by the Israelis, despite evidence top administration officials were told before bombs were dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Trump pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar — which he did via phone from the Oval Office during a recent trip to the White House. Sources familiar with the incident told CNN that the administration’s failure to notify Qatar ahead of time, given its central role in negotiations, initially raised serious questions about US credibility at the time. But when Trump forced Netanyahu’s apology, the “answer came back very firmly” that the US was serious about maintaining the US-Qatar alliance, according to a regional source said.\n \n\n   \n  “You saw the picture, Netanyahu reading from a paper. The picture talks more than the pen,” the regional source said, noting the executive order bolstering the alliance between the US and Qatar.\n \n\n   \n    Qatar delivering on Taliban talks crucial to first term shift\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Trump and Qatar started on tense footing during his first term.\n \n\n   \n  “Qatar’s influence in the US in 2016 was nominal at best,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2017, at the beginning of a diplomatic crisis sparked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cutting diplomatic ties and imposing a blockade on Qatar, Trump lambasted Doha.\n \n\n   \n  “We had a decision to make,” Trump said, describing conversations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. “Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism.”\n \n\n   \n  The aggressive remarks perplexed even his then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who asked aides following the speech how the comments had ended up in the president’s speech, according to a source familiar with the interaction.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson and top military officials then made it a priority in the following months to brief Trump on the strong US-Qatar relationship on both military and diplomatic fronts, particularly providing details about Qatar being home to Al-Udied which is the largest US military base in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Tillerson, a former Exxon executive, also had particularly close relations with Qataris after having done energy deals with the Gulf nation.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, according to Freedman, Doha “sought to flip the script really quick and went on a lobbying and PR firm hiring blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  “They started hiring Republican heavyweights from (former Attorney General) John Ashcroft’s firm, several other firms, Ballard, that were very close to the President,” Freeman explained. Attorney General Pam Bondi was a registered lobbyist for Qatar during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  But over time the blockade made Trump more receptive to Qatar, a former administration official said. The Gulf nations claimed the blockade was an effort to apply economic pressure on Qatar as a result of its alleged support for terrorism, but as it continued Trump worried it was stifling progress and economic ties in the region, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was also irritated at the other regional players for putting the blockade into place without giving the US advance notice – a move they took just weeks after Trump had visited Saudi Arabia, which was the first overseas trip of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump gives people under attack the benefit if the doubt, he also felt blindsided by the move which he did not like,” said a former Trump administration official.\n \n\n   \n  Less than a year after his inflammatory White House remarks, in April 2018, Trump hosted the Qatari Emir at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  When the Emir visited Washington for a second time in 2019, administration officials noticed that the two developed a good personal rapport, multiple sources said. Trump went to a Treasury Department dinner with the Emir which he had not been scheduled to attend – reflecting a real warming in relations, sources said. At that time, Doha was hosting talks between the US and the Taliban as Trump pushed for an end to the war in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Things were fine, but they had not gone from opponents to friends,” said John Bolton, Trumps’ national security adviser at the time.\n \n\n   \n  That changed, Bolton recalled, after the signing of the Doha agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government which set into motion the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Trump’s top Taliban negotiator, Zalmay Khalilizad, spent copious amounts of time with the Taliban in Doha, meetings that paved the way for the agreement to be signed.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s really the point where they moved, started moving towards the relationship they have now,” Bolton said. “The American president had asked them to do something and they were doing it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump himself has chalked up the difference to having not really known the country in 2017 when he first became president.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t really know them very well,” Trump told reports of his initial take on the small but rich nation in 2017. “As I got to know them, I got to understand them, and I got to realize that they’re in the middle of they are right in the middle of everything. Other countries are there, but they’re an hour and an hour-and-a-half away. A big difference.”\n \n\n   \n    Qatar has come through for Trump where others failed\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s second term there have been multiple instances where the administration has gone back to Qatar when other intermediaries have not delivered.\n \n\n   \n  During Gaza talks earlier this year, the administration at one point tried a new tact putting a Palestinian-American who was not a government official in charge of the talks with Hamas to try and drive a Gaza ceasefire. But when that approach failed to produce results, they shifted back to Qatar as the critical interlocutor with the group.\n \n\n   \n  A similar situation unfolded when it came to efforts to draw Iran into a new nuclear deal. The Trump administration initially relied on Oman to facilitate months of indirect talks with Iran led by Witkoff, but when those talks fell apart the administration turned back to Qatar to engage in dialogue with Iran. Ultimately the deal never manifested, and Trump carried out strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But the importance of Qatar as a trusted go-between had been cemented once again.\n \n\n   \n  Now, advancing the Gaza agreement to the next phase which would include de-militarizing Hamas is set to further test Qatar’s ability to serve as a back-channel with Hamas. White House Spokesperson Anna Kelly said that the Qataris are “invested in ensuring that the deal is implemented.”\n \n\n   \n  But the breadth of efforts that the US and Qatar are working on are also widespread. Dr. Majed Al Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited the wide range of issues the country is working on with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working right now with the administration on DRC-Rwanda, working with them on Venezuela, working with them on Colombia, working with them on the myriad of issues, some of them I can’t mention right now, all related to peace facilitation,” he said at the Concordia Summit event on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in late September.\n \n\n   \n  “That appreciation of the relationship in Qatar does not go unnoticed,” Al Ansari continued.\n \n\n   \n  “This goes beyond any individual, but working with President Trump, working with this administration very closely, is something that has brought a lot of results,” he said. “It’s a relationship that is beneficial for the region as a whole and for the world.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/soccer-premier-league-ange-postecoglou-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"10:58:00-04:00","title":"Ange Postecoglou Fired After Just 39 Days at Nottingham Forest","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ange Postecoglou, the Australian football manager appointed at Nottingham Forest in late 2025, was dismissed after just 39 days in charge following a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea.

George Santos released from prison after Trump commutes his sentence \n       \n  By Samantha Waldenberg, Kaanita Iyer, Fadel Allassan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:44 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgraced former Rep. George Santos,  who had been serving a seven-year term  for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, was released from prison on Friday night after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence, his lawyer tells CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Trump first announced the commutation on Truth Social on Friday evening, and, according to attorney Joseph Murray, Santos’ family picked him up from the prison about five hours later.\n \n\n   \n  “George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” the president wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s commutation comes just months after Santos, 37, surrendered on July 25 to serve  87 months in prison .\n \n\n   \n   Before he surrendered, Santos told Saudi outlet Al Arabiya English that he asked Trump for a pardon but believed he “got stonewalled.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it made it to the president,” Santos said of his pardon request at the time. “Unfortunately, gatekeepers have blockaded for it to ever get to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  But even from behind bars, Santos continued to make his case.  According to his verified X page , he wrote an open letter to Trump earlier this week, pleading for “fairness” while also saying he takes “full responsibility” for his actions.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness — for the chance to rebuild. I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires,” Santos wrote in  the letter published in The South Shore Press. \n \n\n   \n  The law firm that represented Santos celebrated the president’s move, telling CNN, “We applaud the President for correcting this injustice.”\n \n\n   \n  Murray  posted on X  a message on behalf of Santos thanking GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene -who he said “fought like a lion” for him – as well as  Lauren Boebert , Anna Paulina Luna, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom he described as “in regular contact.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos also expressed gratitude to “the greatest DOJ team ever assembled”, specifically naming Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Associated Deputy AG Diego Pestana, and US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, among other. Martin  wrote on X  he was “honored” to have played “a small role” in Trump granting “clemency” to Santos, and thanked the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the commutation drew mixed reaction from lawmakers. Taylor Greene — who wrote a letter to Trump in August asking him to commute Santos’ sentence — also thanked the president in a  post on X , adding that Santos “was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, slammed Trump for focusing on Santos instead of Americans’ health care — an issue at the center of the ongoing government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Donald Trump has time to free serial fraudster George Santos from prison. But he can’t be bothered to address the Republican healthcare crisis crushing working class Americans,” Jeffries said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  In August 2024, the former congressman pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud charges stemming from activity during his 2022 midterm campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I deeply regret my conduct,” Santos said in court at that time. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\n \n\n   \n  Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023, before completing a full term in the US House – becoming only the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  During his short time in Congress, reports emerged of Santos having fabricated parts of his biography, including his employment history and education. He  eventually admitted to  doing that.\n \n\n   \n  Santos represented parts of Long Island and Queens and attempted to run in another New York district before pleading guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Santos had been serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, per the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/europe/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-power-iaea-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:52:00-04:00","title":"Work underway to restore power at Ukrainian nuclear plant as UN announces rare local ‘ceasefire zones’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Work is underway to restore power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, following the establishment of rare 'ceasefire zones' that allow repair crews to operate.

of the line as Prince Andrew gives up his titles \n       \n  Analysis by Sophie Tanno, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:06 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Perhaps the question is not why now, but why it hadn’t happened sooner.\n \n\n   \n  In a move that cements his banishment from royal life,  Prince Andrew  announced he was relinquishing the use of his royal titles and honors, and would no longer be known as the Duke of York.\n \n\n   \n  The decision, announced Friday, was made in close consultation with  Britain’s King Charles III , who is believed to be glad at the outcome, while Prince William and other members of the royal family were also consulted on the discussions, CNN understands.\n \n\n   \n  Along with his statement, Andrew also continued to once again “vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\n \n\n   \n  Dukedom is the highest rank in the British peerage, and the title was given to Andrew on the morning of his wedding to  ex-wife Sarah Ferguson  by his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. The announcement on Friday evening draws a line once and for all, without having to go through the messy machinations of a parliamentary intervention, which would have been required to remove the dukedom.\n \n\n   \n  The relinquishment of such a title within the British royal family is incredibly rare.\n \n\n   \n  The last instance is understood to be over 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward, who was one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons, had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for fighting for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, during World War I.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew still retains the title “prince,” bestowed on him at birth as the son of the then reigning monarch. But he is giving up all other titles conferred on him in honor by the royal family. For a man who clearly relishes his status, this is no small loss.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew stepped down from public life in 2019 following a disastrous BBC interview in which he was questioned about his friendship with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  Three years later, in 2022, he  stopped  using the style His Royal Highness, or HRH, and was stripped of his military titles and charity patronages.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the fallout from his association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial in the United States on federal charges of sexually abusing underage girls, has continued to plague him.\n \n\n   \n  Friday’s decision is thought to be Andrew’s own, and was made in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continue to be a distraction from the wider work of the royal family, his statement Friday said.\n \n\n   \n  While it appears to have been his choice, he – and the rest of the Windsor clan – were facing mounting pressure to resolve the situation. CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams said Andrew had become “toxic to the royal brand.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a signal that… we will not see him in family events, we are not going to see him when there’s a big celebration for King Charles’s 80th birthday in a couple of years; Andrew is out of the fold,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The question is, is this enough to stop the backlash overall tainting the royal family?”\n \n\n   \n  Williams believes a question mark now hangs over Andrew’s continued residence in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor, although he has a private tenancy agreement for the property with the Crown Estate which has not been affected by the change in use of titles and honors, according to a royal source.\n \n\n   \n  The thorny issue of what do with Andrew has loomed over the King since he ascended to the throne in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Charles’ dilemma was one perhaps unique to royals. Andrew is both his brother and a senior member of an ancient institution.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew has largely stayed out of the limelight since 2019 and has only generally attended private family events – one of the most recent being the  Duchess of Kent ’s funeral service, at which he was accompanied by Sarah Ferguson.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, this step-back from public life has done little to stop the headlines.\n \n\n   \n  His links to Epstein have remained in the spotlight, with the prince facing fresh backlash during the 2021 sex trafficking trial of disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, when one of her accusers named Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, multiple British news outlets reported on an email which appeared to raise questions over Andrew’s stated timeline regarding when he cut off contact with Epstein. Similarly, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who will now no longer use the title Duchess of York, has faced backlash in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Files from Epstein’s estate continue to be released by the US House Oversight Committee and there has been media speculation as to whether Andrew’s name will feature in those.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had previously alleged that she had been forced to have sex with the prince after being trafficked by Epstein, is due to be published in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had repeatedly denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault. She died by suicide in April at age 41.\n \n\n   \n  The book’s release comes in the same week that King Charles and Queen Camilla are headed to the Vatican for a historic state visit.\n \n\n   \n  Epstein aside, Andrew has also faced questions over his relationship with an alleged Chinese spy, named by a British court in December as Yang Tengbo. Yang is alleged to have worked for China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a branch of the ruling Communist Party tasked with gaining influence both at home and overseas. A court hearing described Yang as having developed an “unusual degree of trust” with the younger brother of King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  In April this year, a 10-page document on Andrew’s relations with Yang was  released  by British courts.\n \n\n   \n  It seems the palace realized that the institution’s reputation was continuing to be impacted by the disgraced prince despite the previous moves to remove him as a working royal, which may be why further internal discussions took place, leading to Friday’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  There will be those – including monarchy-abolishment campaign group Republic who described the move as “too little, too late” – who say palace should have acted sooner.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s brother Sky Roberts  told CNN  that “this is what my sister was fighting for for so many years,” following the news that Andrew had given up using his remaining titles.\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a day where we’ve shed a lot of happy and sad tears. Happy because it’s a good start,” he said. “Her kids get to know their mom as somebody that really did something in this world, that she actually spread a lot of good and was able to hold people to account.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/sport/baseball-mlb-mariners-blue-jays-game-5-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:49:00-04:00","title":"Eugenio Suárez grand slam powers Seattle Mariners to within one win of first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eugenio Suárez hit a historic grand slam in the bottom of the eighth inning, giving the Seattle Mariners a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays and putting them just one win away from their first World Series appearance in franchise history.

first World Series \n       \n  By Jamie Barton, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It is no exaggeration to say the most important swing of the bat by a  Mariner  in 30 years happened on Friday night.\n \n\n   \n   Eugenio Suárez  approached the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning with the score tied at two each. Moments later, he hit just the second grand slam in franchise postseason history to give Seattle a 6-2 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays  and put the Mariners closer to the World Series than they have ever been.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been waiting for games like this my whole career,” said Suárez in an emotional postgame press conference to which he brought his two daughters.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I had it. Today I had it in front of our crowd, in front of my family – my two daughters, my wife. The moment is very special right now.”\n \n\n   \n  After defeating the New York Yankees in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) – a win which many believed  saved baseball in Seattle  – the Mariners came within two wins of the World Series in the resulting Championship Series but ultimately lost out to Cleveland.\n \n\n   \n  Five years later they were within two victories of the promised land once again, but could not get past the Yankees.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Seattle needs just one more win to erase its unwanted record of being the only active major league franchise never to make it to the Fall Classic.\n \n\n   \n  “After Geno’s grand slam, I’m not sure I’ve heard that building any louder than that,” said Mariners manager Dan Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you emotional thinking about that, and just how loud it was in that moment. Talking to a lot of people who have been around here since the 2001 days, and they don’t remember a time that it was this loud before.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Blue Jays had tied the series with two alarmingly comfortable wins in Seattle in Games 3 and 4, Suárez got the Mariners on the board with a solo home run to left field in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  A magnificent double play from Cal Raleigh got Seattle out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, but the Blue Jays struck back after Mariners starter Bryce Miller was surprisingly sat down in the fifth inning.\n \n\n   \n  A two-out double from George Springer brought home Addison Barger in the fifth to tie the game, before Ernie Clement’s single drove in Alejando Kirk an inning later.\n \n\n   \n  By the eighth inning, the Mariners were facing the serious possibility of having to win both games in Toronto to take the series. But they found a spark from a familiar source, Raleigh tying the game with a floaty fly ball which hung in the air for 6.7 seconds before just barely clearing the wall in left field.\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for about an hour,” smiled Wilson after the game.\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh’s homer – his fourth this postseason and his 64th including the regular season – means he is now tied with Aaron Judge in 2022 for the most in a single year in the American League.\n \n\n   \n  It was also Seattle’s first game-tying or go-ahead home run in the eighth inning or later of a playoff game since Bret Boone in Game 4 of the 2001 American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n \n\n   \n  Having waited 24 years for such a dramatic postseason homer, Seattle fans were treated to another just moments later when Suárez’s heroics gave the Mariners an insurmountable lead.\n \n\n   \n  They now lead the series 3-2 and go back on the road. Game 6 takes place in Toronto on Sunday night.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/business/steinway-piano-factory-trump-trade","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"How a company from the Gilded Age could be the future of US manufacturing","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how Steinway & Sons, a 150-year-old piano manufacturer in New York City, serves as a rare model of successful U.S. manufacturing by relying on handcrafted quality, skilled labor, and domestic sourcing rather than mass production or price competition.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Oversized crowbars bend wood for a piano’s rim. Circular sanders smooth rough edges on costly Sitka spruce soundboards. Hammers and chisels notch a bridge to allow piano strings to vibrate freely.\n \n\n   \n  For 30 years, Bernard Craddock has been one of the roughly 200 workers handcrafting pianos at the 150-year-old Steinway & Sons factory in Astoria, a neighborhood in the New York borough of ﻿Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody has a specific job here,” Craddock said, working on a piano frame. “My job is to set this straight for the hammers to hit the strings.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has vowed to start an American manufacturing renaissance, one of the main aims of his trade war. But manufacturing isn’t easy anywhere in the United States thanks to high costs, strict regulations and lack of workers with the necessary skills.\n \n\n   \n  Steinway & Sons, however, is a rare bright spot in US manufacturing. A company that thrives because it doesn’t mass produce its product. Instead, it uses a small workforce of skilled craftsmen to produce a premium item — world-class pianos.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this storied, legacy brand,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They can charge a premium for that, but they also are serving higher market segments that can afford to pay those premium prices and need to because they’re performing on pianos at the highest levels.”\n \n\n   \n  Most US manufacturers are forced to compete on price, which has become tougher as Trump’s tariffs, especially on key inputs like steel, aluminum and copper, have raised prices.\n \n\n   \n  But by making pianos many consider the best in the world, Steinway can charge high enough prices to keep its US-based operation up and running. A Steinway grand piano can be priced as low as $90,000 or as much as $200,000.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we are the largest manufacturer remaining in New York City, we’re very proud of that. It’s not easy to continue to manufacture in New York,” Steinway & Sons CEO Ben Steiner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steiner said his company thrives because it focuses on quality merchandise.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no other way with the cost structure that we have to operate in New York City, or even operating in the United States or in Europe,” he added. “Unless you’re focused on quality and innovation, you’re not going to survive.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s trade agenda could affect jobs\n \n\n   \n  Despite the stated goal of reshoring manufacturing jobs, Trump’s tariffs on most US imports may be  having the opposite effect .\n \n\n   \n  The US shed another  12,000 manufacutring jobs in August , the latest data available, for the fourth month in a row. Roughly 42,000 jobs have been lost since April.\n \n\n   \n  Hersh said Trump’s chaotic trade agenda is acting as a roadblock to factory hiring.\n \n\n   \n  “Businesses don’t like (tariffs), but they can adjust to a reasonable tariff,” Hersh said. “(Trump has) created uncertainty for the economy that just has businesses sitting on their hands, not being able to make decisions about investment or to hire new workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House told CNN that the goal of Trump’s policy is to ensure domestic manufacturers are able to source everything they need in the US, from inputs to workers.\n \n\n   \n  “America cannot just be an assembler of foreign-made parts. The Trump administration is taking a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshore every step of the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “There is no shortage of American hands and minds to build America’s next industrial Golden Age.”\n \n\n   \n  But American manufacturing looks very different from five decades ago, when millions of workers were employed to perform specific tasks along assembly lines. After trade agreements flourished in the 1990s, many of those jobs moved abroad.\n \n\n   \n  And in today’s age of automation and artificial intelligence, factory floors are increasingly filled with robots. That means US factories require fewer workers with specialized skills.\n \n\n   \n  Like at Steinway, where making pianos suitable for the world’s best concert halls isn’t a quick process. Building a piano takes Steinway’s skilled craftsmen 11 months from start to finish. On average, workers complete only four or five pianos a day.\n \n\n   \n  And because the piano’s many components are domestically sourced, Steiner said tariffs haven’t impacted them significantly.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s minor impacts in certain materials, but because we manufacture in the United States, it’s not a major issue for us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Maintaining a consistent workforce\n \n\n   \n  While top-of-the-line pricing and domestic sourcing can solve a lot of problems for Steinway, it can’t solve them all.\n \n\n   \n  One of the biggest challenges facing the piano maker is a potential shortage of Sitka spruce lumber, which Steiner said makes the very best instruments.\n \n\n   \n  “For the Sitka spruce, we find that the best in the world comes from a particular part of Alaska where there’s a very short growing season,” he said. “As a consequence, the trees grow very slowly.”\n \n\n   \n  And Steinway needs to make sure one other component is in good supply: skilled workers.\n \n\n   \n  The factory in Astoria has been in almost continuous operation since 1873, with only temporary pauses in piano production during the Great Depression and World War II. During that time, the company produced glider parts for the war effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It not only kept the lights on, so to speak, but it kept some of the valued craftspeople around,” said Anthony Gilroy, Steinway’s Vice President for Marketing and Communications. “The Steinways were smart enough to know that after the war you’d get a lot of people coming back willing to work but without the skills to build pianos, and you needed these old timers, if you will, here in the factory to train the next generation of piano makers.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s part of the reason Steinway & Sons has never considered relocating out of New York City. It’s those highly specific jobs – performed by “old timers” like 30-year craftsman Craddock in the frame assembly department – why Steinway keeps calling Astoria home.\n \n\n   \n  “The skills that they have, you can’t replicate it. You can’t just open up a factory somewhere else and have those skills,” said Steiner. “So long as our craftspeople are here I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t be, then we’ll still be making our pianos here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/politics/snap-food-stamps-november-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Millions of Americans at Risk of Losing Food Stamps Amid Federal Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amid a federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, will run out of funds by early November.

at risk of losing food stamps next month amid shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Roughly 42 million people are at risk of losing critical food assistance in November amid the federal government shutdown. And it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will step in to find the funds to continue paying benefits, as it has with  other priorities .\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program will run out of money in two weeks, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “So you’re talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families, of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Like other members of the Trump administration, Rollins cast blame on the Democrats,  posting on X  Thursday that they are putting “their political agenda ahead of food security for American families.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have argued Republicans are at fault for being unwilling to negotiate a spending deal that includes the extension of  expiring enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Rollins’ comments came a week after the US Department of Agriculture told states that there is not enough money to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues. The agency asked states to hold off on November payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  About one in eight Americans receive help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. A key pillar of the nation’s safety net, the program provides enrollees with an average monthly benefit of $188 per person, as of May.\n \n\n   \n    Debate over contingency funding\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s largest anti-hunger program, SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, but November benefits are expected to total around $8 billion. The USDA’s shutdown plan noted multi-year contingency funding is available to fund benefits in the event of a lapse.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the USDA intends to make at least a partial benefit payment next month, a senior agency official pointed to Rollins’ comments that the program’s funding will be depleted in two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the Trump administration for requiring states to halt the process of issuing monthly benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a deliberate and unprecedented decision intended to inflict pain on millions of hardworking American families — the federal government should instead do everything in its power to prioritize our most vulnerable and make funding available for this critical program,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program is the second nutrition assistance lifeline at risk of running out of money amid the ongoing standoff on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats over approving a federal spending package for the current fiscal year. The impasse forced the federal government to shut down on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which provides food aid to nearly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young children, was on course to deplete its funding earlier this month. But the Trump administration shifted $300 million in  tariff revenue  that’s typically used to fund child nutrition programs to keep WIC operating. The infusion should be enough to cover benefits for the rest of the month, according to the National WIC Association.\n \n\n   \n  However, there is not enough of that tariff revenue to also shore up the food stamp program for November, a senior USDA official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The looming lack of funding is already forcing 17 states to stop accepting new food stamp applications. That’s because their systems would require them to send partial October payments with November’s benefits. Other states are able to separate payments for the two months and can distribute October’s aid to new enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   \n    Critical program\n \n\n   \n  Food stamps provide critical assistance to families who need the help to be able to eat, said Gina Plata-Nino, acting director of SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group.\n \n\n   \n  The November benefits are especially important with Thanksgiving on the horizon, she said. And food pantries can’t fill the gap since they are already under strain.\n \n\n   \n  The administration should act urgently to protect food stamp benefits, as it has done with its other priorities during the impasse, said Ty Jones Cox, vice president of food assistance at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t let households who need help purchasing food become another casualty of this shutdown,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/arizona-inmate-execution-richard-djerf","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"Arizona Executes Man for 1993 Killing of Four Luna Family Members","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Richard Kenneth Djerf, a 55-year-old man convicted of killing four members of the Luna family—Albert Luna Sr., Patricia Luna, Rochelle Luna, and Damien Luna—in Phoenix in 1993, was executed by lethal injection in Arizona on October 18, 2025.

1993 \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona’s  second execution of the year .\n \n\n   \n  Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\n \n\n   \n  His execution was the  fourth in the country this week  and the 39th of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\n \n\n   \n  Djerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  No representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\n \n\n   \n  It took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  Barcello said Djerf’s veins “were not optimal” and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n \n\n   \n  “By all accounts the process went according to plan and without any incident,” Barcello said. A month ago, Djerf  released a statement  in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\n \n\n   \n  The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\n \n\n   \n  There was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with  15 doses  of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\n \n\n   \n  Executions resumed in 2022, and  three prisoners were put to death  that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\n \n\n   \n  The review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona last carried out a death sentence in mid-March,  executing Aaron Brian Gunches  for the 2002 killing of Ted Price.\n \n\n   \n  With Djerf’s execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.\n \n\n   \n  Five more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/17/uk/prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-titles-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-04:00","title":"Prince Andrew Gives Up Royal Titles After String of Scandals","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has formally relinquished his royal titles, including Duke of York, after enduring years of public scrutiny stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct linked to Jeffrey Epstein and connections with an alleged Chinese spy, Yang Tengbo.

crackdown, DHS statements on arrests face a problem of credibility \n       \n  By Eric Levenson, Josh Campbell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Sat October 18, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of public statements from the Department of Homeland Security during its  migrant crackdown in Chicago  and across the country has been contradicted or undermined by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing.\n \n\n   \n  These issues have been particularly notable in three prominent incidents: the arrest of a WGN employee, the shooting of a US citizen accused of ramming police vehicles and ICE’s detention of a 13-year-old in Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  A closer look at the incidents underscores the broader skepticism of the Department of Homeland Security’s statements as federal agents have moved into city streets in Chicago and elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a  federal judge temporarily halted  the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, saying its statements about protests were “not reliable.” The administration had highlighted several arrests for carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents – but the judge responded that federal grand juries had refused to indict at least three of those arrested, indicating a lack of probable cause.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” US District Court Judge April Perry wrote in her order of those incidents.\n \n\n   \n  A judge openly questioning the credibility of law enforcement reflects a larger problem and raises questions as to what recourse ordinary citizens or immigrants have when accused.\n \n\n   \n  “A lawyer’s credibility isn’t just about personal integrity; it’s a factor judges are required to consider when ruling,” said Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. “Simply put, parties lose when courts find their lawyers untrustworthy. DHS’s problem is how alarmingly consistent judges have been with their questions about the department’s work and its attorneys’ trustworthiness.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. DHS has said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst,” and its agents are facing a surge in attacks against them.\n \n\n   \n  To understand this credibility issue, CNN took a closer look at DHS statements about the three high-profile incidents involving federal immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the contradictions between the DHS statements and other evidence, a spokesperson said, “We stand by everything we have previously said.”\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of WGN employee\n \n\n   \n  Video from a bystander last week captured the arrest of an employee working for the  Chicago TV station WGN .\n \n\n   \n  In the video, officers put the employee, Debbie Brockman, in handcuffs while she lies prone on the ground, her pants falling down. The officers then put her in an unmarked vehicle and leave the scene.\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the agents like, well, why are you detaining this person?” Josh Thomas, the witness who took the video of the arrest, told CNN. “They basically tell me she’s obstructing justice.”\n \n\n   \n  Thomas said he did not witness Brockman’s interaction with the agents before she was detained.\n \n\n   \n  Brockman was released without charges – either for obstructing justice or assault – after about seven hours of detention, according to her attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  After the video spread on social media, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia  McLaughlin said in a post on X  that the arrest came as US Border Patrol was driving around conducting immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, her attorneys disputed McLaughlin’s version of events and said she was attacked by federal agents while on her morning commute.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work,” the attorneys said.\n \n\n   \n    Car ramming suspect and firearm\n \n\n   \n  DHS’s statements about the shooting of a 30-year-old US citizen have been undermined by a criminal complaint and by an attorney who watched body-camera footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Marimar Martinez, the US citizen, was arrested and shot multiple times by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago on October 4.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a  post on X  that multiple drivers, one of whom was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” rammed a law enforcement vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A  DHS press release  repeated the allegation that Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” Together, the statements gave the impression Martinez had been brandishing her firearm when she was shot.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez was charged in federal court with forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. The criminal complaint, though, does not mention a semi-automatic weapon or that Martinez was armed.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the complaint alleges Martinez drove into and side-swiped a CBP vehicle. When an agent got out of the vehicle, Martinez drove at the agent, who fired about five shots at Martinez, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  In court Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney Aaron Richard Bond said Martinez “forcibly impeded Border Patrol agents,” and that the case involved a dangerous weapon – a motor vehicle. Martinez pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN she has a concealed-carry license and had a handgun in her purse, inside a holster with the snap closed. “(It was) never brought out in this incident,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Parente has disputed the government’s account generally as well. He said he viewed body-camera footage, which has not been made public, that he said shows a CBP vehicle swerved into Martinez’s vehicle — not the other way around. Then, “within seconds,” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  “Normally in a criminal case I would not speak to the media until the case is over, but there is such misinformation out there that the public needs to see this is not what they’ve been sold by the government,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I think anybody who sees what’s going on today is going to question these indictments coming out of the Department of Justice,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    Arrest of Massachusetts teen\n \n\n   \n  A 13-year-old in Everett, Massachusetts, was  detained by ICE  and moved to a different state last week in a case in which local officials have contradicted a key statement from a DHS official.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest took place October 9 when police called Josiele Berto, the mother of 13-year-old Arthur, to say her son had been arrested. The teenager was then detained by ICE and moved to Virginia, she soon learned.\n \n\n   \n  The Berto family is from Brazil and have had a pending asylum application since arriving in the US in 2021, Berto said.\n \n\n   \n  McLaughlin, the DHS official,  posted on X  what she said were the “facts” of the case, saying the teenager “was in possession of a firearm and 5-7 inch knife when arrested.”\n \n\n   \n  Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said a teenage boy – who he did not name because he is a juvenile – was arrested after Everett Police received a “credible tip” accusing him of making “a violent threat against another boy within our public school.”\n \n\n   \n  He confirmed the presence of the knife but was adamant that the teen did not have a firearm. “No guns were found,” DeMaria said.\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the discrepancy between the statements by McLaughlin and DeMaria over whether the child had a gun.\n \n\n   \n    Judge calls for use of body cameras\n\n \n\n   \n  Credibility questions have long trailed law enforcement agencies, whether federal or local, and police statements immediately after an arrest have occasionally proved to be incorrect or misleading. The murder of George Floyd, for example, was  initially described by Minneapolis Police  as, “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.”\n \n\n   \n  Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former DHS executive, said misleading claims can be exposed in the modern age.\n \n\n   \n  “In an era where everyone has a camera in their pocket, social media has been flooded with videos of immigration operations,” she said. “DHS must seriously understand that any blatantly misleading claim about tactics can often be easily disproved in this new digital age, especially if they’re happening frequently.”\n \n\n   \n  The credibility questions have also placed a spotlight on one law enforcement tool often missing from immigration enforcement operations: body-worn cameras. The technology is a staple at police departments across the country, documenting encounters with the public and helping clarify questionable incidents and competing claims.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago questioned whether federal law enforcement agents are following an earlier order and said she will  require all agents with body cameras  to have them on during encounters with immigration protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579509","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"16:04:00Z","title":"Masked thieves steal 'priceless' jewels from the Louvre Museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A brazen robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning involved four men who broke into the Galerie d'Apollon using a basket lift on a truck to access a second-floor window.

    The White House starts demolishing part of the East Wing to build Trump's ballroom \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Monday, October 20, 2025 • 9:12 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Trump's $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing. Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening \"right behind us.\" \"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,\" he said, adding, \"It just started today.\" The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property. \"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,\" Scharf said last month. It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown. The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself. \"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" he said of the White House. The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Nothing will be torn down,\" Leavitt said when she announced the project in July. Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn. Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed \"with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.\" The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself. At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement. The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so. Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom. Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available. \"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" the company said in an emailed statement. The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580732","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"23:30:00-20:00","title":"Dodgers and Blue Jays Set for World Series Clash in 2025","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1993 after defeating the Seattle Mariners in a hard-fought seven-game ALCS, with George Springer's late home run sealing the series.

The Toronto Blue Jays are in their way \n         By Becky Sullivan \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 11:30 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Toronto Blue Jays, with a 4-3 win in Monday night's American League Championship Series Game 7 over the Seattle Mariners, are headed back to the World Series for the first time in more than 30 years. Their opponent: the $340 million buzzsaw known as the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       With the biggest payroll in baseball, the Dodgers are baseball's most successful franchise in recent years, with two World Series titles and five National League pennants over the past nine seasons. Now, they are four wins away from becoming the sport's first repeat champions in a quarter century. The Blue Jays emerged in July as one of the best teams in baseball and ended the season 94-68 on top of the AL East, a remarkable turnaround from 2024's last-place finish in the division. In the ALDS, Toronto's bats overwhelmed their division rival New York Yankees, pouring on 34 runs over four games. Still, Toronto needed all seven games of the ALCS to return to the World Series. The Mariners took the Blue Jays to the brink with 14 home runs and some dominant pitching performances that helped them jump out to a 2-0 series lead. But the Mariners, the only MLB franchise to have never reached the World Series, cracked as the pressure mounted late in the series. With a 3-2 series lead, needing just one win for their first-ever pennant, the Mariners committed three errors in a Game 6 loss, then, after taking a 3-1 lead in Game 7, allowed a late three-run home run by Toronto's George Springer to dash their hopes again. \"It was never a doubt that one of these guys was going to come through. It was just a matter of when,\" said Toronto pitcher Jeff Hoffman in a TV interview with Fox after the game. \"We kept it close enough for long enough, and they did.\" It is Toronto's first trip to the World Series since 1993, when the Blue Jays won back-to-back titles. By contrast, the 93-69 Dodgers stumbled at times during the regular season, including several late-game collapses by a shaky bullpen and a humbling September sweep by the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates. But in the postseason, Los Angeles has looked unstoppable. In the NLDS, the 96-66 Philadelphia Phillies managed only a single win over the Dodgers. And in the NLCS, Los Angeles swept the 97-65 Milwaukee Brewers. The Dodgers' crown jewel, the two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani,  single-handedly powered  Los Angeles to their Game 4 NLCS-clinching victory with three home runs as a batter and, as starting pitcher, 6.1 shutout innings with 10 strikeouts — a performance so herculean that it was instantly in the conversation for the greatest individual game of all-time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In other words, the Dodgers are firing on every cylinder — and they will be an even bigger challenge for Toronto than Seattle. The Blue Jays excel at putting balls into play, which worked to their advantage in the ALCS. But Los Angeles is a better defensive team than the Mariners, and their starting pitchers are a level above, too. But Los Angeles does have a weakness: their bullpen, which lost plenty of games for the Dodgers in the second half of the season. The Blue Jays could have an opportunity there if they can put more pressure on the Dodgers' starters than the Brewers did (just two earned runs over four games). Game 1 of the World Series is set for Friday, Oct. 24, in Toronto. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579618","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"As deadline for Trump's colleges compact looms, schools signal dissent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the deadline for universities to sign the Trump administration's Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education approaches, several major institutions—including MIT, Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, USC, Dartmouth College, and the University of Virginia—have publicly rejected the agreement.

5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to  a list of commitments  that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds. The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things. Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing. MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document \"includes principles with which we disagree,\" MIT President Sally Kornbluth  wrote in a letter  to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. \"And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Following that rejection,  President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would  be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter. Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California followed, with statements \"respectfully\" declining the offer. On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges  that hadn't yet sent rejection  notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas,  according to  The Wall Street Journal . \"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead,\"  McMahon wrote on X after the meeting . She said attendees had a \"positive and wide-ranging conversation about the Compact.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But following that meeting, two schools, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College, announced they also would not be signing on to the agreement. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think \"a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence.\" UVA said it wanted \"no special treatment\" when it comes to federal funding. \"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education,\"  wrote Paul Mahoney , the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact. UVA's previous president  resigned this summer  under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An  automated emailed response  said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats. Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580328","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00-20:00","title":"Trump's fake video featured 'Danger Zone.'

It's unclear what impact this ruling will immediately have on the ground. The 9th Circuit's decision applies to only one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month blocking the deployment. \"Right now, until the district court acts on the second TRO, national guard members from Oregon, or any other state cannot deploy,\" Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement. The ruling comes in the wake of a series of Trump authorizations to deploy National Guard troops to American cities including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. President Trump has said the  deployments are necessary  to protect the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and reduce crime. On Oct. 16, a federal appeals court  upheld  an earlier District Court ruling in Illinois,  temporarily blocking  the president's federalization and deployment of the National Guard there. The Trump administration has  asked the Supreme Court  to intervene. Trump called the National Guard to Portland last month The Trump administration  federalized 200 members  of the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28 after the president described Portland on social media as \"War ravaged\" and \"under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.\" This  characterization is false , according to local and state officials, residents and journalists on the ground. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek  told NPR  on Oct. 6 that the president's portrayal was \"ludicrous.\" \"We had thousands of people on the streets of Portland for the Portland Marathon,\" she said. \"The city is beautiful. The city is thriving.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The federal government has argued in court documents that the National Guard is needed to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June. They wrote that protesters had assaulted federal officers \"with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices, causing injury.\" In their own court documents, attorneys for the city of Portland and the state of Oregon wrote that the protests had been small and largely peaceful for months. In a declaration provided to the court, Craig Dobson, an assistant chief with the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), stated that the protests have never been so out of control that local officers couldn't respond. \"In fact, on any given weekend,\" he stated, \"the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has warranted greater PPB resources than the small, nightly protests in front of the ICE facility.\" The federal government, however, has argued that things have been quieter because 115  federal police officers  were sent to Portland this summer to help protect the ICE building there. It says some of those federal officers have since been sent back. And while it's unclear how many remain, the federal government says their deployment is a strain on resources. In response, attorneys for the state of Oregon have said such deployments are a normal part of the federal police's responsibilities. Lower court blocked the deployment  On Oct. 4, Immergut, the U.S. district judge,  granted the city and state  a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from deploying the National Guard to Portland. The president can federalize National Guard members if there's a foreign invasion, a rebellion or a danger of one, or an inability to carry out federal laws with \"regular forces.\" Immergut wrote that the Trump administration did not have a legitimate basis for federalizing the National Guard because the protests in Portland had been \"generally peaceful\" since June and did not prevent federal law enforcement officers from doing their jobs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She wrote that the Trump administration described only a few incidents of protesters clashing with federal officers in September before the National Guard federalization. They involved people shining overpowered flashlights in the eyes of drivers, \"posting a photograph of an unmarked ICE vehicle online\" and \"setting up a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials.\" \"These incidents are inexcusable,\" Immergut wrote, \"but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces.\" The following day, despite her ruling, Trump sent 200 federalized California National Guard members to Oregon. A memo from the Department of Defense also authorized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to  deploy to Portland and Chicago . Immergut then granted a second order blocking the Trump administration from sending any federalized members from any National Guard to Oregon. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In its  appeal to the 9th Circuit , the Trump administration said in court documents that the lower court judge had \"impermissibly second-guessed the Commander in Chief's military judgments.\" On Oct. 6, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt  said in a press briefing : \"With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.\" She went on to say that the president was using his authority as commander in chief. Appeals court sides with the president The majority opinion for the 9th Circuit was authored by judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, who were both appointed during Trump's first term. They wrote that the District Court erred when it discounted \"the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August\" outside the ICE facility and focused \"on only a few events in September,\" the month Trump federalized the National Guard. The law, they argued, didn't put such limitations on the facts or circumstances that the president could consider when making a decision to deploy the National Guard. \"The President can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether he 'is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,'\" they wrote. \"Rather than reviewing the President's determination with great deference,\" the panel of judges wrote, \"the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Appeals court Judge Susan Graber, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, writing there was no justification to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard. \"Given Portland protesters' well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Graber wrote. Officials at the White House praised the court's ruling Monday, saying it affirms that the lower court's ruling \"was unlawful and incorrect.\" \"As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield also responded to Monday's ruling with a statement: \"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he wrote. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\" Clarification: An earlier version of this story said the 9th Circuit decision removed \"the\" legal impediment to Trump's deployment of the national guard troops to Portland, implying it was singular. While the court granted a stay for one temporary restraining order, at the time of publication a second order is still in force, so the immediate impact of this ruling is unclear. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5579554","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"18:00:00-04:00","title":"Israel strikes Gaza as both Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 19, 2025, Israel launched targeted military strikes across Gaza, including in the Rafah area, in response to allegations that Hamas militants attacked Israeli troops with gunfire and anti-tank missiles.

Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq also  accused Israel  in a statement on Sunday of \"violating the deal and fabricating pretexts to justify its crimes.\" Hamas has been carrying out a deadly crackdown against rival militias and clans in Gaza, but it's unclear if Sunday's violence was connected to that.

The  Associated Press reported  that Israel had halted aid into Gaza following the attacks, but later decided to resume deliveries on Monday. Netanyahu  said in a statement  that two Israeli soldiers — Maj. Yaniv Kula and Staff-Sgt. Itay Ya'avetz — were killed in the clashes. One day earlier, an Israeli attack on a bus in Gaza City killed a family of 11 people returning to visit their ruined home, according to Gaza health authorities. The family included seven children, the youngest of whom was 5 years old. Israeli forces said the bus was beyond the yellow line Gazans have been warned not to cross, and that troops faced an \"imminent threat\" before firing a tank shell at the vehicle. Gaza's media office has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement 80 times since it took effect,  Al Jazeera reported . The ceasefire agreement  brokered by the U.S. included the release of all of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks more than two years ago. In exchange,  Israel released  nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has also  returned the bodies  of some Israeli hostages who died in Gaza. Israeli officials identified the bodies of two hostages returned from Gaza late Saturday as Ronen Engel and Sontaya Oakkharasri. Engel, 54 when he died, was killed while trying to protect his family during the Oct. 7 attacks. His wife and daughters were freed by Hamas that November. Oakkharasri was a Thai national who was also killed in the Oct. 7 attacks. Sixteen deceased Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, according to Israel's government. The Israeli government says 1,144 people  were killed  in the Oct. 7 attacks led by Hamas in 2023. In the two-year war that began in the wake of those attacks, Israeli forces have killed more than 68,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

When Price finally  dived into the evidence  several years ago, he found there were not many high quality studies, even though chronic pain is one of the  most common reasons  people turn to medical marijuana. \"Anecdotally, [people] say cannabis works great,\" says Price, an assistant professor of neurological surgery at UC Davis. \"It's the only thing that helps them sleep at night, the only thing that takes the edge off.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This is why findings from a pair of major clinical trials in Europe that evaluated cannabis for low back pain — the  leading cause  of disability worldwide — have caught the attention of Price and others who are investigating the plant's potential in pain management. The first, published in the journal  Nature Medicine ,  showed that  a blend of cannabis oil, containing the psychoactive compound THC, as well as CBD and other natural compounds in the plant, outperformed a placebo. The other compared that same proprietary cannabis tincture with opioids. Here, patients were  much less likely to have  gastrointestinal side effects like constipation, and cannabis offered better relief over 6 months than their painkillers. Price believes the new studies are \"groundbreaking\" and will be a \"cornerstone\" of the growing evidence base on cannabis and chronic pain. Because cannabis  remains  a Schedule 1 drug — a category reserved for substances with no accepted medical use — and is  heavily regulated , this type of large-scale clinical trial is  tough  to pull off in the U.S. Vertanical, the German company that funded the trials, expects to win approval to market their full-spectrum cannabis oil, called VER-01, to patients in several European countries in a matter of months. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is requiring the company replicate this research in the U.S., meaning it could be years before the drug has a chance to win approval here. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If politicians or the FDA want to speed up the process, we are ready,\" says  Dr. Clemens Fischer , the founder of Vertanical. The FDA wouldn't comment on the future of VER-01, but a spokesperson told NPR in a statement that it supports \"rigorous, science-based research to evaluate these products.\" A pain relief alternative The findings from the European trials are \"remarkable,\" particularly the fact that cannabis outperformed opioids in terms of pain relief and sleep, says  Kevin Boehnke , an   assistant professor of anesthesiology at the University of Michigan who studies cannabis and chronic pain. The opioid trial had close to 400 participants — about half the size of the other study comparing cannabis and a placebo — and patients knew which drug they were receiving. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While these are limitations, Boehnke says the study was also more \"reflective\" of the real world and validates previous research indicating \"many people deliberately use cannabis in place of opioids\" because they find it more effective and doesn't come with the same side effects. Though Vertanical's cannabis tincture may not be available in the U.S. anytime soon, Boehnke says for people seeking treatment for low-back pain, the study suggests it may be worth trying a similar cannabis product instead of opioids. \"It might not be exactly the same,\" he says. \"But I think this provides a lot of useful evidence for patients.\" Others in the field are more circumspect, though. This is the kind of rigorous study that's sorely needed, says  Simon Haroutounian , who has decades of experience in this area and directs research at the Washington University Pain Center in St. Louis. But he thinks the findings are specific to this particular compound that was tested. In the trial, those in the cannabis group had, on average, about a 30% drop in pain after 12 weeks compared to their baseline. Meanwhile, those who took the placebo had around a 20% reduction.  Haroutounian says it's likely the actual treatment effect is the difference between the two. Another way to look at the efficacy is that the number of people who need to take the drug for one person to get clinically meaningful pain relief is around seven. \"Most of the medications that we have at our disposal for treating chronic pain are in that range,\" Haroutounian says. \"So it's not panacea, it's not a compound that is going to treat all chronic pain.\" Proponents of medical cannabis are quick to point out the drug's safety profile is a clear upside. Unlike opioids, it doesn't come with the same concerns around overdose and addiction. Fischer of Vertanical notes there were no signs of dependency or withdrawal. In fact, he says the participants usually didn't feel high, particularly if they'd taken it for a longer stretch of time. \"You're not stoned,\" he says. \"They go to work, they drive cars, they use machinery, all possible and legal in Europe.\" In the study, however, those on opioids and cannabis did experience about the same rate of side effects, and about 13% ultimately dropped out. Over the years, Haroutounian, a clinical pharmacist, has seen successes and failures with his own patients. One patient had suffered a horrific motorcycle injury and eventually tapered off opioids with the help of cannabis. On the other hand, he recalls the case of an older woman who tried cannabis for knee pain. \"With the first dose, she felt dizzy. She fell and broke her hip,\" he says, \"The next six months she spent in and out of hospital.\" Pain patients want cannabis options Currently there's only one cannabis-derived medication  with FDA approval , the seizure treatment Epidiolex, and it doesn't contain any THC. While it's not entirely clear, experts like Boehnke say THC seems to be one of the \"primary\" compounds responsible for cutting down pain and improving sleep. \"There is no silver bullet chronic pain medication, pretty much for anything,\" he says, \"It's often like, 'oh, I got a little benefit here and a little there,' you're kind of piecing together the puzzle.\" Although most Americans live in a state where marijuana is legal, either  recreationally or medically , there are  well-documented concerns  about the  quality  and consistency of these products. Ellen Lenox Smith , who's with the U.S. Pain Foundation, says FDA approval of a cannabis product would not only make it available in all states – but also give patients with chronic pain confidence in what they were using. \"I wish it was our country that was putting this out right now,\" she says. As a patient advocate, she's frustrated that there isn't better research she can direct others to. \"It's unfortunate because a lot of people are kind of just on their own,\" says Lenox Smith, who has used medical marijuana for nearly two decades to treat her own pain. Her condition, known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, has led to more than two dozen surgeries, including on her neck and spine. Still, a spoonful of her homemade cannabis oil gives her relief and helps her sleep through the night. UC Davis surgeon Richard Price thinks it's a reasonable option for his patients who are not getting an operation, though he'd like to see the findings from Europe replicated in the U.S., before he promotes cannabis more broadly. \"It's really challenging to tell somebody, 'I know you're in pain, but there's nothing I can do for you, and a lot of patients do not want to go on opioids,'\" he says. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5560956","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Can Collagen Supplements Improve Your Skin?

Here's what the research shows \n         By Maria Godoy \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         The explorer Ponce de Leon famously went to Florida in search of the fountain of youth. But if you listen to social media influencers, he should probably have headed to the  supplement aisle  to pick up some collagen. \"I'm in my 40s and if I shave, I look like I'm in my mid-20s,\" a Tiktok creator who goes by Shop By Jake claims   in one paid promotion . \"People ask me all the time, what do you do for your skin? I take collagen,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Claims about the health and beauty benefits of collagen supplements are commonplace these days, especially online. But does the evidence back the hype? The claim Collagen supplements can promote healthier skin, hair and nails, and stronger joints. The theory Collagen is the most  abundant protein in the body . It's found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and bones. It helps maintain our skin's elasticity and volume. It's a structural protein, so it gives strength and integrity to our tissues and keeps joints strong, among other things. But starting in our 20s, the amount and quality of the collagen our bodies produce declines. Factors lik e UV radiation,  smoking and exposure to  environmental pollutants  can speed up that decline. But it's going to happen with age regardless, which is why lots of people turn to collagen supplements. Collagen supplements generally come in two main forms.  Hydrolyzed collagen peptides  are basically collagen that's been broken down into smaller chains of amino acids to make them easier to absorb. They're derived from animal sources, such as fish, cattle, pigs or chicken. That's typically what's used in supplements aimed at improving skin and hair, as well as joint health.   \"The theory is that if you ingest [a collagen supplement,] it goes through the GI tract and gets absorbed and then it theoretically goes to places to support or increase collagen production,\" says  Dr. Lauren Taglia , a board-certified dermatologist with Northwestern Medicine in Naperville, Ill. The second main form of supplement is  undenatured, or native, type II collagen , which hasn't been broken down. It's derived from chickens. Most of the collagen found in cartilage is type II. These kinds of supplements are thought to promote joint health by triggering the immune system to produce chemical messengers that tamp down inflammation. So what does the research say? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The evidence Let's start with skin. When it comes to skin health, there are studies that suggest collagen supplements work. \"There have been randomized controlled trials that have shown that after 8 to 12 weeks of collagen supplementation, things like depth of wrinkles, skin elasticity, dermal thickness seem to be improved,\" says  Dr. Maryanne Makredes Senna , an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School. One  meta-analysis of 19 studies published in 2021  found that, compared with a placebo, people taking collagen supplements had better skin hydration, elasticity and improvements in wrinkles. A  second meta-analysis  was published this year. It looked at 23 randomized controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients who took collagen supplements for skin issues, and it also found significant improvements in those same areas after 90 days. But Senna says those findings came with a big caveat: The studies that found the biggest improvements were lower-quality and were funded by the supplement industry, she says. \"High-quality studies and studies not funded by industry did not show a significant association rate,\" Senna says. Given that, the state of the evidence when it comes to collagen supplements for skin is mixed at best, says dermatologist Lauren Taglia. \"As physician-scientists, we would love to see studies done on a large scale and done independently,\" she says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's a similar story when it comes to collagen supplements for joint health. Studies have shown benefits — such as in  reducing pain from osteoarthritis .  But again, much of the research is industry funded, so it can be hard to disentangle potential bias, says  Dr. David Felson , an osteoarthritis researcher and professor at Boston University. One  systematic review  found that most of the studies of collagen supplements for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis were too low quality to determine whether they really helped. Some studies included in that review reported adverse effects, such as an exacerbation of symptoms. \"With respect to collagen, I don't know what the right answer is,\" Felson says. It could potentially help, but \"there are no large scale studies here and there need to be,\" he says. The bottom line If it's healthier skin you're after, collagen supplements \"could be helpful, but there's not a ton of strong evidence to support them at this point,\" Taglia says. Your best bet is to focus on things that do have robust evidence behind them, says  Dr. Maya Jonas , an assistant professor of dermatology at the Ohio State University. That includes  wearing sunscreen and other sun protection  and using  vitamin A-based products like retinol , which have been clinically proven to stimulate collagen production. Keeping your skin moisturized is also important. Lifestyle factors matter too, Jonas says. She recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which provide antioxidants like vitamin C, and nuts and seeds, which are good sources of zinc and copper and help support collagen production. \"We always talk about diet, making sure patients are eating a healthy Mediterranean diet that's well-balanced, avoiding alcohol, not smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke,\" Jonas says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And  get plenty of sleep and exercise , adds Senna. Poor sleep and stress can  take a toll on skin , while exercise can improve blood flow to the skin and may  help counteract the loss of elasticity and dermal thickness  that comes with aging. That's not just good for skin, but overall health, too. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   With age comes wisdom. But it also comes with wrinkles and joint pain. Some wellness influencers say collagen supplements can help with that. NPR's Maria Godoy checked out the evidence behind the hype. MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Ponce de Leon famously went to Florida in search of the Fountain of Youth. But if you listen to social media influencers, he probably should have headed to the supplement aisle to pick up some collagen. Here's a TikTok creator who goes by ShopByJake. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHOPBYJAKE: I'm in my mid-40s, and if I shave, like, I really look like I'm in my mid-20s. People ask me all the time, what do you do for your skin? I take collagen. GODOY: That's a paid promotion that touts collagen supplements for healthier skin, hair and nails and stronger joints, too. Dermatologist Lauren Taglia with Northwestern Medicine says these claims are everywhere. LAUREN TAGLIA: It's a very popular thing. I'm sure we've all been kind of inundated with, like, what it can do. GODOY: Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. It's found in skin, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, hair and nails. TAGLIA: And it's a structural protein. So it gives strength and integrity to the skin. GODOY: In other words, it helps keep skin firm and elastic. Our bodies produce collagen, but Taglia says that starting in our 20s, the amount and quality of that collagen starts to decline. TAGLIA: It's depressing. It is depressing. It definitely slows down. GODOY: Factors like UV radiation, smoking and exposure to environmental pollutants can speed up that decline, but it's going to happen regardless with age, which is why lots of people turn to collagen supplements. TAGLIA: And the thought - or the theory - is that if you ingest it, it goes through the GI tract and gets absorbed, and then it theoretically goes to places to support or increase college and production. GODOY: But what does the science show? Dr. Maryanne Makredes Senna is an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard. She says, when it comes to skin, there is some evidence that collagen supplements work. MARYANNE MAKREDES SENNA: There have been randomized controlled trials that have shown that after eight to 12 weeks of collagen supplementation, things like depth of wrinkles - right? - skin elasticity, dermal thickness seems to be improved. GODOY: But there's a big caveat. She says a recent meta-analysis looked at more than 20 randomized controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients who took collagen supplements for skin issues. It found that the studies that showed significant improvements were funded by the industry. MAKREDES SENNA: High-quality studies and studies not funded by industry did not show a significant association. GODOY: And it's a similar story when it comes to collagen supplements for joint pain and health. Dr. David Felson is an osteoarthritis researcher at Boston University. He says studies have shown benefits, but many are industry funded, so it can be hard to disentangle potential bias. DAVID FELSON: With respect to collagen, I don't know what the right answer is. GODOY: He says it could potentially help, but... FELSON: There's no large-scale studies here, and there need to be. GODOY: Now, if it's healthier skin you're after, Dr. Makredes Senna of Harvard says collagen supplements may help, but your best bet is to focus on things that do have robust evidence behind them, like using vitamin A-based products like retinol at night and keeping your skin moisturized. MAKREDES SENNA: All of these things, you know, your sun avoidance, your sun protection, these are things that we know for sure - right? - without a doubt, help your skin. GODOY: And get plenty of sleep and exercise. That's not just good for skin but overall health, too. Maria Godoy, NPR News.

The tool allows users to create realistic, high-quality audio and video, using text prompts and images. \"It's about creating new possibilities,\" OpenAI promised in a promotional video for Sora 2. \"You can view the power to step into any world or scene, and letting your friends cast you in theirs.\" But with Sora 2, some creators have also made fake AI-generated videos of historical figures doing things they never did. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. changing his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, Michael Jackson, rapping and stealing someone's chicken nuggets, or Mr. Rogers greeting rapper Tupac Shakur to his neighborhood. Some videos reimagined the late Robin Williams talking on a park bench and in other locations. His daughter Zelda  begged fans to stop sending her such AI-generated content , calling it \"horrible slop.\" \"You're not making art,\" she wrote on Instagram, \"You're making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.\" \"It's kind of cool, it's kind of scary,\" says actress Chaley Rose, who's best known for her role in the TV series  Nashville . \"People can borrow from actors, our vulnerability and our art to teach the characters they create how to do what we do. I would hate to have my image out there and not have given permission or to actually be the one doing the acting and having control over the performance.\" Hollywood's top talent agencies first sounded the alarm. \"There is no substitute for human talent in our business, and we will continue to fight tirelessly for our clients to ensure that they are protected,\" United Talent Agency wrote in a statement last week. \"When it comes to OpenAI's Sora or any other platform that seeks to profit from our clients' intellectual property and likeness, we stand with artists. The future of industries based on creative expression and artistry relies on controls, protections, and rightful compensation. The use of such property without consent, credit or compensation is exploitation, not innovation.\" Creative Artists Agency issued a  similar warning last week .  Last year, California's governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring the consent of actors and performers to use their digital replicas. Now, the talent agencies and SAG-AFTRA (which also represents many NPR employees) announced they and OpenAI are supporting similar federal legislation, called the \"NO FAKES\" Act. Until now, some of the videos created using Sora 2 have relied on copyrighted material. For instance, there's a video that shows the animated character SpongeBob Squarepants cooking up illicit drugs. The Motion Picture Association, which represents major Hollywood studios, said in a statement that since Sora 2's release, \"videos that infringe our members' films, shows, and characters have proliferated on OpenAI's service and across social media.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of the union SAG-AFTRA told NPR last week that it wasn't feasible for rightsholders to find every possible use of their material. \"It's a moment of real concern and danger for everyone in the entertainment industry. And it should be for all Americans, all of us, really,\" says Crabtree-Ireland.  SAG-AFTRA says actor Bryan Cranston alerted the union to possible abuses. Now, the union and talent agencies say they're grateful OpenAI listened to such concerns.  The company has announced an \"opt-in\" policy allowing all artists, performers, and individuals the right to determine how and whether they can be simulated. OpenAI says it will block the generation of well-known characters on its public feed and will take down any existing material not in compliance. Last week, OpenAI agreed to take down phony videos of Martin Luther King, Jr., after his estate complained about the \"disrespectful depictions\" of the late civil rights leader. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   OpenAI has agreed to protect the voices and likenesses of people who appear on its new artificial intelligence platform called Sora 2. This morning, the company announced some guardrails after working with actor Bryan Cranston, the union SAG-AFTRA and Hollywood's talent agencies. And by the way, NPR employees are members of SAG-AFTRA. NPR's Mandalit del Barco has this story. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: OpenAI introduced Sora 2 in a fantastical video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: It's about creating new possibilities. DEL BARCO: The app allows users to generate hyperrealistic audio and video using text prompts and images. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Giving you the power to step into any world or scene and letting your friends cast you in theirs. DEL BARCO: But with Sora 2, some creators have also made AI-generated videos of famous people doing things they never did, unauthorized by them, their estates or rightsholders. For example, this is not the real Martin Luther King Jr. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AI-GENERATED VOICE #1: (As Martin Luther King Jr.) I no longer have a dream. I have a nightmare. (Screaming). DEL BARCO: Another AI-generated video has Mister Rogers greeting rapper Tupak Shakur. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AI-GENERATED VOICE #2: (As Mister Rogers) Welcome, neighbor. I'm so glad you could stop by. AI-GENERATED VOICE #3: (As Tupak Shakur) Appreciate you having me, Mister Rogers. AI-GENERATED VOICE #2: (As Mister Rogers) Please, have a seat. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. DEL BARCO: Another reimagines the late Robin Williams on a park bench. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AI-GENERATED VOICE #4: (As Robin Williams) Well, some days I pretend to be 10 different people before lunch. Other days, I just talk to myself until someone laughs. And thankfully, they pay me for it. DEL BARCO: Robin Williams' daughter Zelda begs fans to stop sending her AI-generated content of her late father, calling it horrible slop. You're not making art, she wrote on Instagram, you're making disgusting, overprocessed hot dogs out of the lives of human beings. Some Sora 2 videos recreate people doing all sorts of things. One even had the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, shoplifting graphic cards from Target. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AI-GENERATED VOICE #5: (As Sam Altman) Please, I really need this for Sora inference. This video is too good. CHALEY ROSE: It's kind of cool, and it's kind of scary. DEL BARCO: Actress Chaley Rose says she's seen what AI-generated videos can do. ROSE: People can borrow from actors our vulnerability and our art to teach the characters they create. I mean, of course I would hate to have my image out there and not have given permission or to actually be the one doing the acting and having control over the performance. That is scary. DEL BARCO: Hollywood's top talent agencies first sounded the alarm, saying that without consent, credit or compensation, Sora 2 was exploiting performers, and they warned that clients' intellectual properties were at risk. Last year, California's governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a bill requiring consent of actors and performers to use their digital replicas. This morning, the talent agencies and the union SAG-AFTRA announced that they and OpenAI are supporting similar federal legislation called the No FAKES Act. Until now, some users have been using copyrighted material to generate unlicensed content - for instance, this video of SpongeBob SquarePants cooking up illicit drugs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AI-GENERATED VOICE #6: (As Patrick Star) Yo, Sponge. This stuff looks extra crystally (ph), like restaurant quality. AI-GENERATED VOICE #7: (As SpongeBob SquarePants) We don't call it stuff, Patrick. It's blue barnacle - purest you'll find under the sea. DEL BARCO: Last week, the Motion Picture Association, which represents major Hollywood studios, said that some Sora 2 videos infringe on the copyrights of films, shows and characters. And the national executive director of SAG-AFTRA, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, says it hasn't been feasible for rightsholders to find every possible use of their material. DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND: It's a moment of real concern and danger for everyone in the entertainment industry. And it should be for all Americans - all of us, really - because if the concept of consent isn't fully embedded in everything that's being done with this type of AI technology, there's virtually no way to control or limit what it can do. DEL BARCO: Now, SAG-AFTRA and others say they're grateful OpenAI listened to such concerns. The company says it has an opt-in policy, allowing all artists, performers and individuals the right to determine how and when they can be simulated. OpenAI says it will block the generation of well-known characters on its public feed and says it will take down any existing material not in compliance. They already agreed to take down the Martin Luther King Jr. videos. Varun Shetty, the vice president of OpenAI's media partnership, said in a statement to NPR that the company will soon give rightsholders more control over their characters and how fans can create them.

Hasan Piker, who was supposed to debate Charlie Kirk, on the state of free speech \n         By Leila Fadel, Ana Perez, Arezou Rezvani, Obed Manuel \n        \n           Updated Monday, October 20, 2025 • 12:11 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Hasan Piker was livestreaming on Twitch when news broke that conservative activist Charlie Kirk had been shot while speaking at a Utah university. \"Holy s***,\" Piker said after seeing a grisly video of Kirk being shot in the neck and warned viewers not to watch. \"America is so absolutely f***ed.\" Piker, who was scheduled to debate the late founder of Turning Point USA at Dartmouth College in late September, describes himself as a counterpart to Kirk on the ideologically opposite side. He has amassed a huge following through video game streaming and discussing politics online. He's a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy, of President Trump and of Israel's war in Gaza. On social media, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer even  called  for Piker, who was born in the U.S., to be deported, though she later indicated she was joking. Loomer has the ear of the president and has  described herself  as being \"pro-white nationalism\" and  promoted anti-Muslim views . Piker says he was shocked by the murder of a public figure like him. But what happened in the weeks after scared him in a new way. After Kirk's killing, Trump vowed his administration  would go after leftist groups . Vice President Vance encouraged people to call the employers of anyone celebrating Kirk's death. Later, Trump  signed an executive order designating antifa  — an ideology and not an organized group — a domestic terrorist organization. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr made a not-so-subtle threat against ABC over a comment Jimmy Kimmel made about the suspect in Kirk's killing. ABC pulled him off the air  before reinstating him . Piker told  Morning Edition  he worries that if the Trump administration is successful in stamping out what it deems unacceptable speech, the U.S. will \"end up in an authoritarian nightmare where one of the last bastions of liberalism is eroded and there is no way to go against the wishes of this administration, no matter how violent they may be.\" Speaking to NPR's Leila Fadel, Piker discussed how the Trump administration is cracking down on political opponents and how it affects his own discourse. Piker sees an effort to \"mobilize against all kinds of political dissidents\" He says the Trump administration's wide-ranging terrorist designation of antifa is \"illegal and also intentionally vague to such a degree that if you actually organize any sort of protest against [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] or you demand identification from ICE agents … then you could be considered a domestic terrorist, a designation that hasn't existed.\" Trump and administration officials have accused protesters associated with antifa of attacking federal law enforcement officers in Portland, Ore., and other U.S. cities. At  a recent White House roundtable on antifa , Trump said, \"Everything we're doing is very lawful.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He worries the Trump administration is painting leftists as the cause of political violence Piker points to  press reports  that the Department of Justice removed findings from its website that found right-wing extremists have killed more people than any other domestic terrorist groups as evidence of how the Trump administration is trying to \"one, create this hysterical narrative and then, two, stamp out this kind of leftist violence that they have cultivated in their minds.\" NPR has not confirmed those reports. He added that \"it's very obvious that the administration has decided that we live in a post-truth era and that they can simply say this was a leftist antifa shooter.\" \"Any time there is any shooting,\" Piker continued, \"one of the most damaging aspects of this misinformation, I think, has been that people believe it.\" His own questioning by federal agents set off alarm bells earlier this year  While returning to the U.S. from a trip abroad in May, Piker said he was questioned for hours by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. He said they asked how he felt about President Trump and asked his opinions about Hamas. \"But one of the most interesting questions that I got in the process was if I had actually interviewed anyone from a known State Department-designated terrorist organization,\" Piker said. \"That's not only not illegal, but it's something that the media does all the time.\" Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin  told The Associated Press  that Piker was \"lying for likes\" and that he was \"promptly released\" after his inspection was complete. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Physically being shot and silenced like Kirk isn't Piker's biggest fear. \"If I let fear dictate my life — fear of violent repercussions coming from random people who want to take matters into their own hands — then I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing,\" he said. Piker's biggest fear as a provocative leftist commentator is what could come from the government. \"It's not that I advocate for anything that I think is unconscionable or violent or anything like that, but it's more so that things can always be weaponized and misconstrued,\" Piker said. \"I worry that the administration might take unprecedented action that is otherwise illegal and against constitutionally protected speech.\" The radio version of this story was edited by Arezou Rezvani and produced by Ana Perez and Taylor Haney. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   When President Trump returned to office, he touted one executive order in particular. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back. (APPLAUSE) FADEL: That commitment was tested almost immediately when international college students involved in Palestinian activism started getting detained and threatened with deportation. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Armed agents of the state who kidnapped her from outside of her home. CORY BOOKER: Disappearing people off of American streets. NOOR ABDALLA: The fact that you can kidnap someone basically from their home for going to a protest is terrifying. FADEL: At the time, free speech advocates warned immigration enforcement was being used as a tool for censorship. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) ERIC LEE: Your citizenship won't save you. Your views will be next. FADEL: So we here at MORNING EDITION examined the state of the First Amendment at the time, who felt more free to speak, who felt silenced and the way this right - from which all other rights flow - is shifting in America. It's a question that's come up again and again, most recently after the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The administration is making it clear that some speech will have consequences. So we're resuming conversations on the First Amendment in the weeks ahead, starting with Hasan Piker, who's described himself as Kirk's counterpart on the ideologically opposite side. Piker is the most popular leftist streamer in North America on Twitch, where he streams nearly eight hours a day to an audience of millions. And he was livestreaming when he saw the video of Kirk's assassination. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HASAN PIKER: Holy [expletive]. America is so absolutely [expletive]. FADEL: He was shocked by the murder of a public figure like him, but what happened in the weeks after scared him in a new way. The vice president encouraged people to call the employers of anyone celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. Dozens of teachers, professors, journalists were fired over personal social media posts or commentary. President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa - not a group but an ideology - a domestic terrorist organization. Federal Communications Chair Brendan Carr made a not-so-subtle threat against ABC over a comment Jimmy Kimmel made. ABC pulled him off the air. It got fierce backlash across the ideological spectrum from Republican Senator Ted Cruz... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: I think it is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying we're going to decide what speech we like and what we don't. FADEL: ...To right-wing podcaster Candace Owens. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CANDACE OWENS: Do you understand? We never, ever, ever should be applauding federal action when it comes to speech. FADEL: Kimmel is back on the air, but questions around free speech are louder than ever. And Hasan Piker thinks Americans should have been alarmed a long time ago when the first student protester was detained by immigration agents. PIKER: I kept warning people saying, look, it's not going to stop. They're using the immigration enforcement agenda as a vehicle. FADEL: He's a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy, of Israel's war in Gaza, of Trump. And conservatives paint him as a radical extremist. During Kirk's memorial, Piker listened to Trump say he would go after influencers, to Trump's top adviser Stephen Miller threaten an undefined they. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHEN MILLER: They cannot imagine what they have awakened. They cannot conceive of the army that they have arisen in all of us. FADEL: So when we spoke, I asked what he sees taking shape. PIKER: I think that they're trying to mobilize against all kinds of political dissidence. They want to stamp it out. That much is clear to me. The anti-fascism terrorism designation is both illegal and also intentionally vague to such a degree that if you actually organize any sort of protest against ICE or you demand identification from ICE agents, which is something within the confines of reasonability and totally legal to do - right? - then you could be considered a domestic terrorist, a designation that hasn't existed. We're talking about a country where objectively the overwhelming majority of political violence, whether it be mass shootings or school shootings alike, are happening by right-wingers, like, far-right anti-government extremists. This is the ADL's own data. This is the Department of Justice's own data that has shown this reality. FADEL: Right. Data that has now disappeared from their website. PIKER: Yes, something that they deleted. But even from the perspective of, like, political violence, it's very obvious that the administration has decided that we live in a post-truth era and that they can simply say this was a leftist antifa shooter anytime there's any shooting. One of the most damaging aspects of this misinformation, I think, has been that people believe it. People now think that leftist violence is happening with regular frequency. And I think that this is presented in an environment where the administration is trying to, one, create this hysterical narrative and then, two, stamp out this kind of leftist violence that they have cultivated in their minds. It's a truly terrifying media environment, but it's a suppression that I'm familiar with, obviously. FADEL: Familiar because he was detained and questioned by Customs and Border Protection on his way back into the country in May. What were they asking you? PIKER: They asked me how I feel about Donald Trump. They asked me about my opinions on Israel. They asked me my opinions on Hamas. But one of the most interesting questions that I got in that process was if I had actually interviewed anyone from a known, State Department-designated terrorist organization. That is not illegal. That's not only not illegal, but it's something that the media does all the time. FADEL: Do you think differently at all about what you say online in the last couple weeks? PIKER: I guess, but more so because I worry - and this is something that has always been at the back of my mind. I worry about the potential repercussions. It's not that I advocate for anything that I think is, like, unconscionable or violent or anything like that. But it's more so that things can always be weaponized and misconstrued - the utilization of metaphor, for example, or hyperbolic statements made amongst friends that can be reflected on years later in a very different light. These are things that happen all the time on the internet. FADEL: Is it because you are worried that you could physically be silenced and killed the way that Charlie Kirk was, or is it because you don't want to have something misconstrued and somebody maybe act on those words in a way that you don't want them to? Or... PIKER: Yeah. I'm worried about the administration taking action. That's always been a fear. If I let that kind of fear cause any sort of, like, editorial setbacks, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing. If I let fear dictate my commentary, if I let fear dictate my life - fear of, like, violent repercussions coming from random people who want to take matters in their own hands - then I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing. I worry that the administration might take unprecedented action that is otherwise illegal against constitutionally protected speech. FADEL: If we can't have conversations in this country and if having those conversations has possible consequences from the administration or others, what happens? PIKER: We end up in an authoritarian nightmare where one of the last bastions of liberalism is eroded and there is no way to go against the wishes of this administration, no matter how violent they may be. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: That's Hasan Piker, one of the leading voices in leftist political commentary, speaking on the state of free speech following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580221","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00-04:00","title":"This isn't the Louvre's first high-profile heist.

Here's a history of earlier thefts \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 1:11 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Louvre Museum in Paris is closed after masked thieves stole priceless jewels in what officials have described as a  seven-minute heist in broad daylight . Shortly after the museum opened on Sunday morning, two bandits used a lift on a truck to break into its Galerie d'Apollon, which houses the French crown jewels and other treasures, through a second-floor window. That's according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which is looking for four male suspects. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The thieves smashed display cases, stealing what a Louvre spokesperson described as  eight items  of \"inestimable cultural and historical value.\" They then fled toward a nearby highway on high-powered scooters. Two pieces of jewelry — including the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III — were found near the museum afterward. The heist deals a huge blow to one of the most popular museums in the world, which houses valuable works like Leonardo da Vinci's  Mona Lisa  and has drawn  some 9 million  visitors in recent years. But it's not a first. Thieves have raided the Louvre multiple times over the decades — and once managed to snatch  Mona Lisa  herself right off the wall. A heist made the  Mona Lisa  famous   The Louvre was built in the 12th century as a military fortress, and by the 14th century was used as a royal residence and art collection center. The revolutionary government opened the  Louvre as a public museum , the Musée Central des Arts,  in 1793 . It displayed art that had previously been held in the royal collection, embodying the Enlightenment ideals that had ignited the French Revolution four years earlier. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Louvre now boasts some  35,000 works  on permanent display. And despite its fortified history, it has fallen victim to multiple high-profile security breaches, including the 1911  theft of the  Mona Lisa . On a Monday morning that August, Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian handyman who had briefly worked at the Louvre, donned his old uniform, walked into the museum and, when the coast was clear, took the painting right off the wall. He slipped it out of its frame in a nearby stairwell and carried it out of the building underneath his smock. At this time, the  Mona Lisa  was not widely known outside the art world. And because the museum was in the practice of briefly taking paintings off the walls to photograph them, the  Mona Lisa 's disappearance went unnoticed for a whopping 28 hours — at which point it quickly became international news. \"The  Mona Lisa  becomes this incredibly famous painting, literally overnight,\" writer and historian James Zug  told NPR in 2011 , a century later. In fact, the heist got so much attention that Peruggia decided not to try to sell it and stashed it away in the false bottom of a trunk instead. He did try to sell it more than two years later, approaching an art dealer in Florence who immediately grew suspicious and alerted authorities. Peruggia eventually pleaded guilty to stealing the painting — saying he wanted to return it to its native Italy — and was sentenced to eight months in prison. The heists didn't stop there  The Louvre and its works survived Nazi Germany's occupation of France during World War II, thanks to Jacques Jaujard, the director of France's national museums. On the eve of the war, Jaujard, with the help of staff and volunteers, secretly arranged for the  Mona Lisa  and thousands of other masterpieces to be evacuated to the French countryside to protect them from looting. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Nazi forces did systematically loot tens of thousands of works from Jewish families and wealthy collectors during the war. Many of them were returned to France through postwar government efforts, but have not been reclaimed. The Louvre began displaying them in 2018, as part of a  renewed push to reunite them  with the heirs of their original owners. The postwar period saw a string of bold daytime art thefts, as   National Geographic  reports . In May 1966, thieves stole five pieces of antique gold and ruby jewelry from the airline cargo terminal at JFK Airport in New York City. The pieces were on their way back to the Louvre after being displayed on loan at a Virginia museum. The  New York Times  reported  that two months later, detectives found the jewelry in a grocery bag as it was being passed \"from one man to two others in exchange for an envelope containing $2,900.\" All three were arrested. A decade later, in  December 1976 , three masked men broke into the Louvre and stole what the  New York Times  described as \"the priceless diamond-studded sword of King Charles X.\" That theft bears striking similarities to Sunday's events. A museum spokesperson told the paper at the time that the trio \"climbed a metal scaffolding set up by workers cleaning the facade of the former palace and smashed unbarred windows on the second floor,\" then smashed a display case to grab the sword. They clubbed two guards and \"raced into the Apollo Hall\" — the same gallery that was targeted this weekend — but fled the way they came after triggering an automated alarm. The sword has never been recovered.  The Times  notes that it wasn't the only item stolen from the Louvre in 1976: That January, it says, \"burglars made off with a painting of the Flemish school.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Two pieces of 16th-century Italian armor were taken from the Louvre one evening in May 1983, a mystery that persisted for decades until the  breastplate and helmet turned up  at an estate auction in Bordeaux, France in early 2021. The pieces were reinstalled in the museum that year, but details about their disappearance remain scarce. In July 1990, thieves cut a small painting — Pierre Auguste Renoir's  Portrait of a Seated Woman  — from its frame and stole it in broad daylight from a third-floor gallery, according to  news reports at the time . That triggered an  inventory, which revealed  that a dozen pieces of ancient Roman jewelry had also been taken sometime before then. And in May 1998, a thief made off with a 19th-century landscape by the French painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. According to  news reports , after a guard discovered it missing, officials shut down the museum for hours and police conducted body searches on hundreds of visitors as they exited. The painting has never been found. Why do these breaches keep happening? In the wake of the 1990 thefts, then-Louvre director Michel Laclotte  declared a \"crisis ,\" the  Washington Post  reported at the time. Laclotte said the crisis would be used to increase museum security measures, including upping its security budget by about $1.8 million and hiring a \"super-specialist\" to recommend policy changes. But issues like overcrowding, disrepair and  climate change  have continued to plague the Louvre. Tensions reached a boiling point this January, when Laurence des Cars, the Louvre's president-director, sent a letter to France's culture minister outlining issues of concern — which was leaked to the press. They included \"increasing malfunctions in severely degraded spaces,\" \"outdated technical equipment,\" and \"alarming temperature fluctuations endangering the conservation of artworks,\" according to the French newspaper  Le Parisien. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Later that month, French President Emmanuel Macron presented  extensive renovation plans  for the museum, which are expected to cost as much as $834 million and take nearly a decade to complete. Among other changes, the project would establish a dedicated room for the  Mona Lisa , create a new \"grand entrance\" to relieve congestion and  upgrade the building's security system . Louvre staff — including gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel — say those upgrades can't come soon enough. In June, the museum shut down for part of a day after staff spontaneously went on strike to protest \"unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called 'untenable' working conditions,\" the  Associated Press reported . Those vulnerabilities are top of mind in the wake of Sunday's heist, as other cultural institutions tighten security and French officials  take the blame . \"What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels,\" Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin told France Inter radio on Monday. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-19-2025-f3d95cf76018541ff824853d1bcd3356","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-25","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Supreme Court Upholds Free Speech Rights, Protecting Offensive and Controversial Content","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the First Amendment protects the right to free speech, even when the speech is offensive or controversial.

Trump did not say whether he thought the Israeli strikes were justified, saying “it’s under review.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 US envoys visit Israel to bolster truce, and Gaza militants hand over a hostage’s remains \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A father returns from Israeli detention to find Gaza and his family shattered \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israel says Hamas hands over ‘2 coffins of deceased hostages’ from Gaza \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that he may visit Israel in the coming days.  “We’re trying to figure it out,” he told reporters, saying the administration wants to “go and check on how things are going.” Regarding the ceasefire, he said that “there’s going to be fits and starts.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Health officials said at least 36 Palestinians were killed across Gaza, including children.

A senior Egyptian official involved in the ceasefire negotiations said “round-the-clock” contacts were underway to de-escalate the situation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak to reporters. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take “strong action” against any ceasefire violations but didn’t threaten to return to war. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Israel’s military said militants had fired at troops in areas of Rafah city that are Israeli-controlled according to agreed-upon ceasefire lines. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hamas, which continued to accuse Israel of multiple ceasefire violations, said communication with its remaining units in Rafah had been cut off for months and “we are not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Mourners carry bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire, during their funeral in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Sunday, Oct. 19, 2025.

Al-Awda hospital said it received 24 bodies from several Israeli strikes in the Nuseirat and Bureij camps in central Gaza. An airstrike on a makeshift coffeehouse in Zawaida town in central Gaza killed at least six Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government. A strike in Beit Lahiya in the north killed two men, according to Shifa hospital. Another strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least four people, including a woman and two children, according to Nasser Hospital. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Where is peace?” said Khadijeh abu-Nofal in Khan Younis, as hospital workers treated wounded children.

Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war. Engel’s wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a November 2023 ceasefire. Hamas in the past week has handed over the remains of 12 hostages. Its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said it found the body of another hostage and would return it Sunday “if circumstances in the field” allowed. It warned that any escalation by Israel would hamper search efforts. Israel on Saturday pressed Hamas to fulfill its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28  deceased hostages , saying the  Rafah border crossing  between Gaza and Egypt would stay closed “until further notice.” It was the only crossing not controlled by Israel before the war. Hamas says the war’s devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned. Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry posts photos of bodies on its website to help families attempting to locate loved ones. Some are decomposed and blackened. Some are missing limbs and teeth. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said.

The next stages are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory. The U.S. plan proposes the establishment of an internationally backed authority. Hamas spokesman Hazem Kassem said late Saturday that the group has begun discussions to “solidify its positions.” He reiterated that Hamas won’t be part of the ruling authority in a postwar Gaza, and called for the prompt establishment of a body of Palestinian technocrats to run day-to-day affairs. For now, “government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the (power) vacuum is very dangerous,” he said. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are  seen as generally reliable  by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

But the situation facing one group of federal employees who are working without pay is difficult for lawmakers to overlook: The Capitol Police officers who protect them every day. The officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10th. \"They're asked to be everything to everybody,\" said Terry Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief. \"You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also have to be a person who will welcome visitors and be a tour guide.\" Gainer says the job is tougher than ever, as public officials face growing threats and violence. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Gesturing toward two officers guarding the ornate Senate Reception Room, Sen.

People have mortgages, they have families.\" Officer Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chair, called on lawmakers last week to end the shutdown, writing in a statement that \"Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass.\" Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who sits on the House committee that oversees the force, says he has kept in touch with Papathanasiou and Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan. \"What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all and yet we're walking among people who are directly impacted by this,\" Morelle said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Trump administration has signaled  plans to repurpose funds  to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, though Democrats have questioned the legality of the moves. \"I'm not unhappy with that result if it's the case,\" Morelle said. \"But I'm still mindful of the fact that what the president is talking about, whether it's military troops or law enforcement, it's patently illegal,\" he said. Morelle says the missed checks are not the only slight, saying officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose  President Trump's pardons of rioters  who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th. He notes a Jan. 6 memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol  is still uninstalled  on Capitol Hill, despite a federally-mandated deadline. \"We've always stood with Capitol police and law enforcement and we've shown that in word and deed,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters last week. \"All of a sudden after all of these issues where they have been frankly insulting to members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, 'Oh well, we really care about them,\" Morelle said. Gainer, the former Capitol Police chief, said officers continue to do their jobs with professionalism, but each slight makes it more difficult to convince them that the long hours and personal risk are worth staying for. Last week, Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif.,   briefly clashed with an officer  during a protest, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology. Barragán said the officer grabbed her as she tried to enter Johnson's office. \"One of the skill sets we require of police officers is your ability to remember, because you're good witnesses,\" Gainer said. \"So your memory doesn't get erased, but what you try to do is reset the clock.\" Asked this week whether they were holding up during the shutdown, a group of officers said they were — \"for now.\" But one officer had an addendum to that assessment. \"Give it a month, maybe not,\" he said. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   The government shutdown is affecting the same people who protect Congress.

Keeping watch over the chamber during each of these votes is the Capitol Police force. The officers missed their first full paycheck October 10. TERRY GAINER: They're asked to be everything to everybody. GRINGLAS: Terry Gainer is a former Capitol Police chief who later served as Senate sergeant-at-arms. He says the job is tougher than ever as public officials face growing threats and violence. GAINER: You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also need to be a person who'll welcome the visitors and be a tour guide.

KATIE BRITT: These men and women are paying the price. It's absolutely selfish and ridiculous. It's heartbreaking. I mean, people have mortgages. They have families. GRINGLAS: The Capitol Police union last week called on lawmakers to end the shutdown. Democratic Representative Joe Morelle is ranking member on the House committee that oversees the force. JOE MORELLE: What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all. And yet we're, you know, walking among people who are directly impacted by this. GRINGLAS: The Trump administration has signaled plans to repurpose funds to pay federal law enforcement, but Morelle says the missed checks are not the first slight. He says many officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose President Trump's pardons of rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6. MORELLE: All of a sudden, now, after all these issues where they have been, frankly, insulting to the members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, oh, well, we really care about them.

Europe and Russia.  The road known as Via Baltica will pass through a narrow strip of land between Belarus and  Russia  ’s  Kaliningrad exclave , called the Suwalki Gap, which has often been described as  a potential targe  t if Russia were to attack NATO. Polish President Karol Nawrocki and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, at an inauguration ceremony on the border between their countries, said the road was the region’s most important corridor and highlighted its role in the region’s defense. NATO troops could potentially move faster in aid of the Baltics by using Via Baltica. “This road has a dual purpose – it will help our economy and strengthen the defense capabilities of our region,” Nawrocki said Monday. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Poland and its Baltic neighbors have been  on high alert  since multiple Russian drones entered Polish territory and Russian fighter jets crossed into Estonian air space in September.

   By Jacob Fenston \n        \n           Saturday, October 18, 2025 • 7:43 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         If you live in any major city or suburb in the U.S., you may have noticed more and more parents hauling their kids around on bulky cargo bicycles. Some families are ditching their second car, forgoing a minivan, or going car-free altogether. Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century — and they're popular elsewhere on the globe. But until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. Now they're making a comeback. There are a few reasons behind the surge in cargo bike ridership, including better bicycle infrastructure, and bikes that are easy to ride, even if you're not an athlete. Lelac Almagor was not a biker before she bought her cargo bike. \"I'm a very lazy person,\" Almagor says. She thought she'd give the bike a try, and probably return it. \"But by the third day I was like, 'Oh, this is actually going to change my life,'\" says Almagor, who lives in Washington, D.C. Now she rides her three kids to school every day, even when it's pouring rain or hot and muggy. \"It's such a better start to my day, that now there's truly not weather that I would rather drive in,\" Almagor says. She bought the bike six years ago — back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens crowding the bike racks, not to mention the riders she sees heading to other schools. Almagor got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. Bikes designed to carry kids Today's cargo bikes are designed specifically for transporting kids, with comfy seats and rain canopies, and, importantly, electric motors. Philip Koopman, a longtime D.C. bike shop owner, says there were no electric cargo bikes when his kids were young. He toted them around around the city in a trailer behind his bike, muscling up hills. \"Most people don't want to be sweaty when they get to work,\" Koopman says. \"So having these different options, it just makes cycling so much more attainable for so many more people.\" On a recent Saturday, Koopman was helping people test ride cargo bikes at the  DC Family Bike Fest . The event drew hundreds of parents, including Patricia Stamper, who was trying out different bikes with her two kids. \"I'm 39, I'm losing weight, I need some help,\" Stamper says. \"And this is cheaper than bariatric surgery, it's cheaper than Wegovy.\" The bike she's eyeing is pricey, at around $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it, to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work and go shopping. While cargo bikes are expensive, riders point out they're much cheaper than cars, especially when you account for gas, insurance, parking and maintenance. Better bike infrastructure The first protected bike lane in the U.S. — separated from car traffic — was installed in 1967 in Davis, Calif. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such lanes can be found all over the country. Minneapolis is  often ranked  as the best cycling city in the nation, with more than 200 miles of bike lanes and trails. \"If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes,\" says Laura Mitchell, who lives in the city. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a \"game changer\" for her family. So, earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free, to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. People aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. Unlike Minneapolis, Houston is often near the bottom of bike rankings.  Brian Jackson, who lives in Houston, frequently drops off his two kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school and daycare. He gets a lot of quizzical looks. \"A lot of people are like, 'I've never seen anything like it,'\" Jackson says. Jackson does see a few other cargo-bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. He says Houston has a \"secret strong bike culture,\" and drivers usually give him plenty of space, especially when they see the kids on board. A second bicycle boom Since the very first bicycles, people jerry rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike — at least in North America and Europe — was about a century ago. Back then, cities were buzzing with workmen on bicycles. \"There'd be knife sharpeners with a little studio set up on the back of their bikes. There were glaziers — people who fixed broken windows,\" says Jody Rosen, author of the book  Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle . It all started with the Great Bicycle Boom of the 1890s. Rosen says now we're in a new, 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. Lelac Almagor, the D.C. cargo bike mom, says she thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the e-bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them. That makes it seem normal — just a practical way to get around with your kids. The very best advertisement for cargo biking, she says? The carpool line at school. \"When the car line is wrapping around the block, just gliding past in our little flotilla of cargo bikes. There's no way, as a parent, not to be like, 'maybe we should do that.'\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   You may have noticed more parents hauling their children around on bulky bicycles. I mean, who needs a minivan? Cargo bikes have been around for more than a century, but until a few years ago, they were all but forgotten in North America. NPR's Jacob Fenston set out to learn why they're making a comeback. JACOB FENSTON, BYLINE: It's a school day morning, and Lelac Almagor is shuffling her kids out of the house in Washington, D.C. The 6-year-old is staying home sick. But the other two head for the bike. LELAC ALMAGOR: My kids are very, very slowly climbing into the bike, and soon - I hope - they're going to put their seat belts and helmets on so that we can go to school and be on time. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Going as fast as I can. ALMAGOR: Well, whoever's first is going to get to pick the music. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: OK. FENSTON: Technically, it's a tricycle - two wheels in the front and, in between, a big wooden box where the kids sit. ALMAGOR: All right. You ready? FENSTON: She pilots through narrow bike lanes and then on a path next to the train tracks. Finally, she stops at a red light next to the school. Is this the carpool situation? ALMAGOR: Yeah. It lines up all the way around the block that way. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE BLOWING) FENSTON: The carpool lane - parents sitting in cars and SUVs and gnarled traffic on a hectic four-lane road. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) FENSTON: Almagor says this is the best advertisement for riding a cargo bike. ALMAGOR: On those first couple days of school, when the car line is, like, wrapping around the block, just, like, gliding past in our, like, little flotilla of cargo bikes, and it's like, there's no way not to - as a parent, not to be like, maybe you should do that. FENSTON: She bought her bike six years ago. Back then, she'd see maybe one other cargo bike parent at school. Now there are dozens. She got so into cargo bikes, she left her teaching career and now works for a bike company. There seem to be a few reasons for the surge in popularity. One is the bikes themselves - much easier to ride, even if you're not an athlete. PHILIP KOOPMAN: With your feet flat on the ground, not on the saddle. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. KOOPMAN: And push forward, and the kickstand will pop up there. Just push ahead. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Push ahead. KOOPMAN: There you go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: OK. FENSTON: Philip Koopman is a longtime bike shop owner in D.C. On a recent Saturday, he was helping people test ride cargo bikes at a family bike festival in the city. It drew hundreds of parents and kids. Koopman says, for serious cyclists, biking with kids is nothing new. KOOPMAN: My kids are 29 and 32. And there was, back then, no such thing as electric motors or cargo bikes. They spent thousands of miles in a Burley trailer. FENSTON: What's different now is the technology, bikes designed specifically for transporting kids with comfy seats and rain canopies and, importantly, electric motors. KOOPMAN: Most people don't feel comfortable or they don't want to have - you know, be sweaty when they get to work. So having these different options, it just makes cycling attainable for so many more people. FENSTON: People like Patricia Stamper (ph). She was at the festival with her two kids, trying out different bikes. PATRICIA STAMPER: I'm 39. I'm losing weight. I need some help. And, yeah - and this is cheaper than bariatric surgery. So I really appreciate it. And it's cheaper than Wegovy. FENSTON: Bike she's eyeing is pricey - $2,500. But she thinks it'll be worth it to get some exercise, get her kids to school, ride to work, go shopping. STAMPER: I live in a food desert. There's only, like, two grocery stores for 90,000 people. So I would like other options to be able to venture out in the city, and parking's atrocious. FENSTON: Another reason more people are riding cargo bikes - there's better bike infrastructure. The first protected bike lane in the U.S. - separated from car traffic - was installed in 1967 in Davis, California. But it wasn't until 40 or 50 years later, in the 2000s, that other cities followed suit. Now such protected lanes can be found all over the country. Laura Mitchell lives in Minneapolis, often ranked as the best cycling city in the U.S. LAURA MITCHELL: If it's not safe to ride a bike, it's going to be hard to get people on bikes. FENSTON: That's especially true for parents braving traffic with young kids. Mitchell says getting a cargo bike was a game changer for her family. So earlier this year, she started the Minneapolis Cargo Bike Library, where residents can check out a bike for free to test it out, or for the occasional trip to a big box store. It's been so popular, she quickly had to cap the number of users. MITCHELL: The demand has been much, much higher than we've been able to meet. FENSTON: But people aren't only biking with their kids in cities with great infrastructure. BRIAN JACKSON: I am Brian Jackson (ph), and I live in Houston. FENSTON: Jackson often drops off his kids by cargo bike. He's the only one at his school in daycare. He does see a few other cargo bike parents on the bike trails, and he wishes more people would give it a try. JACKSON: A lot of people are - have never seen anything like it. They're like, what on earth is that? They always ask, like, did you make that yourself? FENSTON: Since the very first bicycles, people jerry-rigged them to carry cargo, including passengers. The heyday of the cargo bike, at least in North America and Europe, was about a century ago. Jody Rosen is author of the book \"Two Wheels Good: The History And Mystery Of The Bicycle.\" He says cities back then were buzzing with workmen on bikes. JODY ROSEN: There'd be knife sharpeners with kind of, like, a little studio set up on the back of their bike. There were glazers, people who fixed, you know, broken windows. FENSTON: There were bakers bikes and butchers bikes, he says, mail bikes and milk bikes. It all started with the great bicycle boom of the 1890s. ROSEN: This is when bikes became much cheaper and widely adapted by regular old folks as a means of transportation. FENSTON: Now, he says, we're in a new 21st century bicycle boom, and cargo bikes are part of it. ALMAGOR: You know I have your backpack, right? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Oh, yeah. FENSTON: Back in D.C., Lelac Almagor says goodbye to her kids as they climb out of her trike. The 4-mile ride to school took about 20 minutes, probably faster than driving. ALMAGOR: Have a good day. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: That's really gross. FENSTON: She thinks the biggest reason there are more people riding cargo bikes isn't the infrastructure or the bike technology. It's seeing other parents riding them, whether it's school or the local park. Back when she bought her giant trike, she'd never actually seen one in real life. ALMAGOR: It was this, like, bizarre thing I had seen on the internet. I wasn't even sure if it was real or if it would come if I ordered it. Right? I think it's very different if every birthday party you go to has, like, 20 cargo bikes of all different shapes and sizes. FENSTON: That makes it seem normal, she says - just a practical way to get around with your kids.

segunda vuelta de las elecciones presidenciales en Bolivia \n    \n \n LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, will be Bolivia’s next president, preliminary results showed on Sunday, paving the way for a major  political transformation  after almost  20 years  of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party and during the  nation’s worst economic crisis in decades . “The trend is irreversible,” Óscar Hassenteufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said of Paz’s lead over his rival, former right-wing President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga. Paz won 54.5% of the votes, early results showed, versus Quiroga’s 45.5%. Paz and his popular running mate, ex-police Capt. Edman Lara, galvanized working-class and rural voters outraged over record inflation and an acute dollar shortage that has sapped food and fuel supplies.  But for all their disillusionment with the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, Bolivian voters seemed skeptical of Quiroga’s radical 180-degree turn away from the MAS-style social protections and toward an International Monetary Fund bailout. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “A lot of people are wary of (Quiroga’s) shock measures.

But he says he’ll take a gradual approach to  free-market reforms , in hopes of avoiding a sharp recession or jump in inflation that would enrage the masses — as has happened before in Bolivia. Morales’ effort to lift fuel subsidies in 2011 lasted less than a week as protests engulfed the country. Paz basks in victory, for a moment Paz’s supporters erupted into raucous cheers and ran into the streets of La Paz, Bolivia’s capital, setting off fireworks and honking car horns. Crowds descended around the downtown hotel where Paz declared victory. Some shouted, “The people, united, will never be defeated!” “Today, Bolivia can be certain that this will be a government that will bring solutions,” Paz said, flanked by his wife and four adult children. “Bolivia breathes winds of change and renewal to move forward.” Shortly after the results came in,  Quiroga conceded to Paz . “I’ve called Rodrigo Paz and wished him congratulations,” he said in a somber speech, prompting jeers and cries of fraud from the audience. But  Quiroga  urged calm, saying that a refusal to recognize the results would “leave the country hanging.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We’d just exacerbate the problems of people suffering from the crisis,” he said. “We need a mature attitude right now.” For the first time in years, the U.S. State Department congratulated the Bolivian president-elect and said it was looking forward to working with Bolivia to “restore economic stability, expand private-sector growth and strengthen security.”  Tensions have simmered between the nations ever since Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008 and the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2009. Paz has vowed to rebuild Bolivia’s relations with Washington. Paz inherits an economy in shambles Behind the celebrations, Bolivia faces an uphill battle. To make it through even his first months, Paz must replenish the country’s meager foreign currency reserves and get fuel imports flowing. Since 2023, the Andean nation has been  crippled by a shortage of U.S. dollars  that has locked Bolivians  out of their own savings . Year-on-year  inflation soared  to 23% last month, the highest rate since 1991. Fuel shortages paralyze the country, with motorists often waiting days in line to fill up their tanks. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Vowing to avoid the IMF, Paz has pledged to scrape together the necessary cash by fighting corruption, reducing wasteful spending and restoring enough confidence in the country’s currency to lure U.S. dollar savings out from under Bolivians’ mattresses and into the banking system. But Paz’s stated reluctance to slam on the fiscal brakes — with promises of cash handouts for the poor to cushion the blow of subsidy cuts — has led to criticism. “It’s just so vague, I feel like he’s saying these things to please voters when fiscally it doesn’t add up,” said 48-year-old Rodrigo Tribeño, who voted for Quiroga on Sunday. “We needed a real change.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An outsider with political experience Although Paz, the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who was in office from 1989 to 1993, has spent more than two decades in politics as a lawmaker and mayor,  he appeared in this race as a political unknown  — shooting unexpectedly from the bottom of the polls to a  first-place finish in the August vote . His party swept six of nine regional departments in the country, including the Andean highlands of western Bolivia and the large, coca-producing region of Cochabamba, winning over key swaths of Indigenous Bolivians that once comprised Morales’ base. Paz’s slogan of “capitalism for all” appealed to merchants and entrepreneurs who flourished in Morales’ heyday of booming natural gas exports but later chafed against his high taxes and regulation as the coffers ran dry. “We’re all so tired of this crisis. We just want things to go back to how they were in the first years of Morales, when we had money — but for the better this time,” said Wendy Cornejo, 38, a former Morales supporter selling crackers in downtown La Paz. Quiroga, by contrast, carried the wealthier eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, known as the country’s agricultural engine. “There’s a very clear class difference. For Quiroga, you have people who’ve been in politics and in the economic elite for a long time — businesspeople, agro-industrialists,” said Verónica Rocha, a Bolivian political analyst. “With Paz, it’s the opposite.” An ex-cop shakes up the race The race looked to be a staid affair until Paz surprised everyone by picking Lara as his running mate. The charismatic young ex-policeman had zero political experience but gained fame on TikTok after being fired from the police for denouncing corruption in viral videos. Unemployed for months, Lara scraped by selling second-hand clothes and worked as a lawyer helping Bolivians come forward to expose corruption. His humble origins and fiery promises of universal income for women and higher pensions for retirees resonated with many former MAS supporters. But they also frequently forced Paz into damage control, causing tension on the campaign trail. Lara didn’t accompany Paz to the campaign headquarters in La Paz late Sunday, surprising many supporters. But he struck an unusually conciliatory tone in his remarks after learning of their victory. “It’s time to unite, it’s time to reconcile,” Lara said. “Political divisions are over.” Paz takes office on Nov. 8. ___ Associated Press writer Carlos Valdez in La Paz, Bolivia, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/ap-allamerica-basketball-team-102d247a7ed8497d9babcd976d86793e","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"16:39:22+00:00","title":"Braden Smith and the Rise of College Basketball Culture: A Look at Player Decisions and Preseason Rankings","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights key college basketball players and programs in the 2024 season, focusing on the strong cultural emphasis on staying in college to pursue national championships.

Smith’s decision earned him another similarity to Edey: unanimous preseason All-American. Smith earned all 57 votes from a media panel in The Associated Press preseason All-America team released on Monday, a week after the Boilermakers were  voted preseason No. 1  in the  AP Top 25  for the first time. He was joined on a big man-heavy first team by Texas Tech’s JT Toppin (52 votes), Michigan’s Yaxel Lendeborg (30), BYU freshman AJ Dybantsa (22) and Florida forward Alex Condon (16). “That’s just how Purdue has always been, how every player has always been,” Smith said. “Paint recruits players, recruits the same people and that’s how they think, how we think.

After testing the NBA waters, the 6-9 forward decided he wanted a chance to reach the Final Four, so he stayed in college and transferred to Michigan. The addition of Lendeborg helped the Wolverines earn  a No. 7 ranking  in the preseason poll after reaching the Sweet 16 a year ago. Last season, Lendeborg joined Indiana State’s Larry Bird as the only players to have 600 points, 400 rebounds and 150 assists in a season. He averaged 15.8 points and 11 rebounds per game in two seasons at UAB, earning American Conference defensive player of the year honors both years. AJ arrives BYU took a big step in its first season under coach Kevin Young last season by reaching the Sweet 16. The No. 8 Cougars have even higher expectations this season after landing Dybantsa. The nation’s No. 1 recruit had nearly every major program jockeying for his services but chose to play in Provo. The athletic 6-9 forward is an efficient scorer who finishes strong at the rim, has a good midrange game and is a superb defender — attributes that have him projected as a potential No. 1 overall NBA draft pick. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Condon returns Condon announced he was heading to the NBA draft after Florida’s national championship last season before changing his mind.

Amazon Web Services disrupts websites across the internet \n         By Jaclyn Diaz \n        \n           Updated Monday, October 20, 2025 • 6:12 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         A massive outage at Amazon Web Services disrupted major websites and apps on Monday, in a show of how  one company 's online infrastructure has become essential for many modern businesses to function. Amazon  said it was fixing the problem, but some disruptions were still ongoing as of Monday evening. Tech experts tell NPR the incident highlights just how vulnerable companies are to these kinds of outages. Here's what to know about what happened and why a single outage could be so damaging. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The outage started early Monday Amazon  reported  \"increased error rates and latencies\" starting around 3 a.m. ET that involved its facility in Northern Virginia. Users reported trouble with popular websites and apps including Duolingo and the online games  Roblox  and Fortnite. Financial service companies like Coinbase, Robinhood and Venmo also reported disruptions, as did the companies that operate the chatbots Perplexity and ChatGPT. Amazon said its main website was affected. United Airlines, Canva, Reddit and Flickr also acknowledged problems with their websites. The Associated Press, NPR and  The New York Times ' Games also said they had issues. Amazon said late Monday that it was  making \"progress\"  to restoring full functionality. How Amazon's cloud computing powers much of the internet Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS, is like an invisible scaffolding that helps much of the internet function. AWS lets companies store and manage data online using its database service DynamoDB, which was the service affected by the outage. \"In other words, they rent out their cloud computing resources to others so they can serve their own customers,\" says Chang Lou,   an assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in cloud computing. An early-morning software update to DynamoDB, however,  contained an error , which took down the service in Northern Virginia. The error within that update then caused a chain reaction of service failures and disruptions. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Amazon says it has invested more than $50 billion in data centers in the state, which is home to the largest cluster of  data centers in the United States . Amazon's importance in cloud computing is a mixed bag for customers According to Synergy Research Group , AWS holds about 30% of the worldwide cloud computing market. Other big players are Microsoft and Google. Betsy Cooper, a cybersecurity expert and the director of the Aspen Institute's Policy Academy, says there are pros and cons to companies using Amazon or another big provider for cloud computing. They offer strong cybersecurity protections and convenience. \"We all have an incentive to use the big companies, because they're so ubiquitous and it's easier for us to access all of our data in one place.\" But, she says, there's a downside. \"That's great until something goes wrong, and then you really see just how dependent you are on a handful of those companies.\" Editor's note:   Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR, and it pays to distribute some of NPR's content. Microsoft and Google are also NPR financial supporters. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   A massive outage at Amazon's Web Services division disrupted major websites and apps all across the internet today. Amazon says that they are fixing it, although some disruptions are still ongoing. But just how vulnerable are companies to these outages? Well, NPR's Jaclyn Diaz has been following all of this closely and joins us now. Hi, Jaclyn. JACLYN DIAZ, BYLINE: Hi. CHANG: Hi. OK. So tell us what happened. I first realized something was wrong when I couldn't pay a bunch of people on Venmo this morning. I mean, like, how huge were the ripple effects of these Amazon tech problems? DIAZ: Yeah. So starting really early this morning, people started reporting trouble using popular websites, like in your case, Venmo, but other apps like Duolingo, the online games Roblox and Fortnite. And people reported issues with United Airlines and even financial services like Coinbase, Robinhood and Venmo, as well as chatbox like - chat bots, rather - Perplexity and ChatGPT. But there are also problems with small companies and businesses. Like this morning, I had a doctor's appointment, and even they told me they were having problems sending electronic records and test results because of the outage. CHANG: Wow. Widespread. So what do we know about what might have caused all this? DIAZ: So we reached out to Amazon and they referred us to a brief statement explaining what went wrong. Basically, Amazon runs a cloud computing service called AWS, or Amazon Web Services. And that essentially means they let companies store and manage data online using their database service. And that is called DynamoDB. CHANG: OK. DIAZ: I spoke to Chang Lou (ph), an assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in cloud computing. He said that, essentially, AWS rents out their cloud computing to others so they can serve their own customers. And this is important. So AWS is really important because it's basically the invisible backbone that holds up a big part of the internet. So when something goes wrong, you get a lot of problems everywhere else. And early this morning, AWS made an update to DynamoDB, but that update contained an error. That mistake took down DynamoDB in northern Virginia, and that's where a lot of data centers are on the East Coast. And that outage then caused a chain reaction of service failures and disruptions. CHANG: I see. So many dominos. OK. Obviously, this had really big consequences for so many businesses, but this kind of major outage has happened before, right? DIAZ: Yeah. So I think another similar major tech outage that comes to mind is the 2024 CrowdStrike failure. And that's when millions of computers running on Microsoft Windows were hit, and it cost companies billions of dollars. CHANG: Right. DIAZ: And when that happened, tech experts raised concerns that maybe the world was relying on too few cybersecurity and cloud computing providers. And according to Synergy Research Group, AWS holds about 30% of the market. So other big players are Microsoft and Google. And I spoke to Betsy Cooper, who is a cybersecurity expert and the director of the Aspen Institutes' Policy Academy (ph). She says there are pros and cons to using these huge companies. Like, they offer much stronger cybersecurity protections for smaller companies, and it's also just easy. BETSY COOPER: We all have an incentive to use the big companies because they're, you know, so ubiquitous, and it's easier for us to access all of our data in one place. DIAZ: But she says there's a downside. COOPER: That's great until something goes wrong, and then you really see just how dependent you are on a handful of those companies. DIAZ: And then you get something like we saw today, a domino effect. CHANG: All right, that is NPR's Jaclyn Diaz. Thank you, Jaclyn. And a note, Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR, and it pays to distribute some NPR content. Microsoft and Google are also NPR's financial supporters. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558173","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"09:21:00-04:00","title":"These Voters Want to Overturn Missouri's New Gerrymandered Congressional Map","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Missouri, a growing public backlash against a new gerrymandered congressional map—signed into law by Republican Governor Mike Kehoe—has led to a grassroots campaign led by People Not Politicians Missouri to overturn it through a voter referendum.

Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Lately, on any given day, you'll find Leann Villaluz knocking on doors around Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide the fate of the state's new congressional map. \"There's a sense of resentment, even to regular voters who aren't as involved,\" Villaluz says. \"We have to pick up the slack for representatives who have been elected to do their simple duty and carry out the will of the voters. Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\" Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a  nationwide redistricting battle  in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by  redistricting in favor of Democrats , if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month. Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City. But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it. The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent  Chappell Roan concert  to get signatures. \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\" Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back  Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway  filed a lawsuit in federal court  arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after  initially rejecting it . But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid. \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\" The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval. \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\" The  Democratic National Committee  has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A  slew of lawsuits  have also been filed challenging the new districts. A legal effort, too  Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional. \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\" Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult. \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\" Most, but not all Republicans, are on board Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session. Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right. Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\" But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts. Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so. \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\" Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map. \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\" Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word. \n         \n         Transcript \n         DON GONYEA, HOST:   At least six states, most of them led by Republicans, are pressing ahead with plans to redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms. But in one of those states - Missouri - there's growing opposition to the move, as Savannah Hawley-Bates with KCUR in Kansas City now reports. SAVANNAH HAWLEY-BATES, BYLINE: Thousands of volunteers with a group called People Not Politicians Missouri are part of an effort to overturn the state's new congressional map. LEANN VILLALUZ: I want my vote to count and continue to matter. HAWLEY-BATES: Leann Villaluz is one of them. VILLALUZ: If I'm not represented fairly in a map that's drawn fairly and that we voted on, that silence is my vote. HAWLEY-BATES: She's going door to door in Kansas City to get people to sign a petition that would let voters decide whether to keep the new congressional map. VILLALUZ: Hi. I'm Leann, and I'm going around to Jackson County voters to sign a petition to... HAWLEY-BATES: The group says it already has the more than 100,000 signatures needed to force a referendum and is still collecting more. But the state's top election official disagrees and says they started gathering signatures too early. That's sure to wind up in the courts. If the group is successful, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year. Right now six Republicans and two Democrats represent Missouri in the U.S. House. But the state's new plan, which Republican Governor Mike Kehoe signed into law late last month, decimates the Kansas City district of longtime Democrat U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II. Here's Kehoe introducing the new map in August. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE KEHOE: I appreciate President Donald Trump for raising the level of conversation on this matter. HAWLEY-BATES: The Democratic National Committee is contributing staff and money to the referendum effort, and there's been a slew of lawsuits to challenge the state's new map. Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. REBECA AMEZCUA-HOGAN: Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation. HAWLEY-BATES: She's running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. As she talks to voters for her campaign, she's also gathering signatures for the referendum effort. Amezcuz-Hogan says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources, and splitting it up into three districts will only make it more difficult. AMEZCUA-HOGAN: It would be incredibly discouraging because it already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle's only going to get worse. HAWLEY-BATES: The new congressional map easily passed the Missouri legislature, where Republicans have had a supermajority for years. Michael Davis is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. MICHAEL DAVIS: We should send a conservative message to D.C. HAWLEY-BATES: Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting. DAVIS: The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives. HAWLEY-BATES: But 15 Republicans voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state that would be most affected by redistricting. Bill Allen is one of those Republicans. He represents a district in north Kansas City that is split evenly between parties. BILL ALLEN: I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition. HAWLEY-BATES: Allen opposes mid-decade redistricting and was disappointed that Missouri followed Texas and Trump's lead by doing it. ALLEN: The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party and certainly not the president. And their will is my responsibility. HAWLEY-BATES: Leann Villaluz, the volunteer, says she thinks voters will get the last word. VILLALUZ: Just about anyone who stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign. Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that. HAWLEY-BATES: Villaluz plans to keep knocking doors for the next two months. That's when the group will find out if it's done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's new congressional map.

\n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         One of the biggest days of protest against the Trump administration's policies happened on Saturday in cities around the U.S. The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official. It marked the  second massive wave of protests  organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda. Organizers said about 2,600 No Kings events were planned across nearly every state, and that it projected a bigger turnout than the 5 million it said attended its previous nationwide action in June. Energized by a slew of actions taken by the administration since the summer protests, the group cited widespread  immigration detentions  carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal  education resources  and  environmental protections ,  gerrymandering  and other concerns. Here's a recap of how the protests unfolded. 1. United in protests to 'protect America' Protesters showed up to oppose a wide range of issues, including the administration's immigration tactics and its push for federal and military intervention in Democratic-led states as a way to tackle crime. The diversity of concerns was strung together by the broader messaging of democracy, constitutional rights and the freedom the U.S. was founded on. In Washington, D.C., demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read \"No Kings, No Tyrants.\" Many people wore yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity. Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR \"we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.\" \"This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,\" Kitchen said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats,  addressed D.C. protesters  in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president. Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg \"and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.\" On the West Coast in San Pablo, Calif., Maria Floriano attended a No Kings event with immigration on her mind. Wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies, she compared immigration to butterflies and said \"migration is beautiful\" and \"an act of courage.\" \"We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here,\" Floriano said, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants. 2. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers weighed in House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed Saturday's protests as a \" hate America rally ,\" and other Republicans have derided the event as anti-American. Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\" Trump was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Connecticut House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora  told Connecticut Public  that he considered the \"No Kings\" messaging of the protests \"divisive.\" He also doesn't share protesters' concerns but supports their right to exercise their First Amendment rights. \"I think our democracy is still strong as ever — but, you know, they're free to express themselves,\" Candelora said. 3. Peaceful protesting with song and dance Despite the many criticisms that anti-Trump protesters came to preach, there were displays of optimism, hope and whimsy in several cities. Inspired by  protesters in Portland, Ore. , people in  Los Angeles ,  Hartford, Conn. , and elsewhere showed up to march in inflatable animal costumes. Song and dance broke out in  Salt Lake City  and other cities. As with the previous mass No Kings protests, revolutionary messaging showed up in demonstrators' clothing, chants and signs as protesters sought to remind people that America was founded in opposition to monarchy. In Macon, Ga., protesters belted  \"The Story of Tonight\" from the musical  Hamilton  — a song about the importance of sacrifice and solidarity today for the sake of freedom tomorrow. The protests were largely peaceful. Police in New York City and Washington, D.C., where rallies drew some of the day's biggest crowds, said no protest-related arrests were made. Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas mobilized their states' National Guards in preparation for the protests. \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to  VPM . The Texas Newsroom  reported  that Abbott said in a statement of sending the Guards to Austin: \"Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas.\" The newsroom also reported that state troopers were stationed at entrances to the Capitol grounds inspecting bags but protesters said the law enforcement presence felt smaller than  the previous \"No Kings\" event in June . Saturday's rally was peaceful and there were no arrests,  according to the Austin Police Department. NPR's Joel Rose and KQED reporter Brian Krans contributed to this report. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94019","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-20:00","title":"ICE Tried to Send One Immigrant to a Country He Never Lived In.

After being released from prison in 2014, Surovtsev’s green card was revoked due to a prior conviction for carjacking and burglary. Since then, he has lived in the U.S. with his wife, Samantha, and their family, launching a small painting business in Texas.

His wife, Samantha, has since engaged a team of lawyers, successfully vacating his criminal conviction and seeking to reinstate his green card.

Then he lawyered up \n         By Ximena Bustillo \n        \n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 7:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Samantha Surovtsev met her husband, Roman  Surovtsev , in 2017 while Jet Skiing. When they started dating, Surovtsev was honest about his past. He told her that he had come from the former Soviet Union as a refugee at the age of 4. And that when he was a teenager, his green card was revoked after pleading guilty to carjacking and burglary charges in California. He explained that after being released from prison, in 2014, he spent time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody while they tried — and failed — to deport him to Ukraine and Russia. Both countries, according to legal filings reviewed by NPR, could not provide or confirm Surovtsev's citizenship since he left before the fall of the Soviet Union. They couldn't give him the travel documents needed for deportation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Since then, each year, Roman Surovtsev did a check-in with ICE. In the meantime, the Surovtsevs' lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are  considered stateless . They got married, had kids, and launched  a small commercial painting business in Texas . Then, one day in early August, what should have been a 10-minute errand at a kiosk at the Dallas ICE field office for one of those regular check-ins turned into 30 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, \"praying that he wouldn't be detained,\" his wife told NPR. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There were tears involved, just not knowing what was on the other side of that appointment,\" Samantha Surovtsev recalled. Then she got that call: \"I panicked. I panicked because it said, 'This is a call from a detainee.'\" Roman Surovtsev  joined the trend of others  who are detained at their regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, to meet the administration's 1 million-person annual deportation target. The \"human element\" What makes his case different is that his wife has marshaled a team of lawyers on his behalf. Unlike hundreds of others the Trump administration has vowed to deport as part of its mass deportation goal, Surovtsev has a chance to make his case in front of a judge. \"People need to understand that there's a human element involved with immigration, that every story is unique,\" his wife said. \"Every case deserves to be heard in front of a judge. This is not a black-and-white situation.\" According to the Surovtsevs' lawyers and court filings, ICE has been trying for a second time to deport Roman to Ukraine, which does not have the documentation to prove his citizenship and could draft him into armed conflict. In court filings, his lawyers argue that his re-detention is unconstitutional since there's been no change to make it easier to deport him to his place of birth and that there is \"not a significant likelihood that Roman would be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The absurdity of his situation was highlighted at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas. The north Texas detention site,  which was over its population capacity this summer , also  housed Venezuelan migrants . Surovtsev was given deportation travel paperwork in Ukrainian, according to a court declaration from Zachery Hagerty, the deportation officer processing Surovtsev. Surovtsev, who is fluent in English, does not speak or read Ukrainian. In court filings, the Justice Department, which argues these cases on behalf of the government, said that the re-detention is legal because the agency has once again requested new travel documents from Ukraine. Hagerty in his declaration said he believes Surovtsev could at least be deported to a third country, if not Ukraine. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a request for comment about his specific case. In the meantime, his legal team has successfully vacated his carjacking criminal conviction, arguing that he was not informed of the consequences to his immigration status when he originally pleaded guilty as a teen. \"It's not a complex question. It's not a discretionary issue,\" said Eric Lee, a partner at the law firm Lee and Godshall-Bennett, one of the firms handling the case. \"He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence.\" Navigating due process In the more than two months that Surovtsev has been in detention, he has missed his wedding anniversary, his wife and daughter's birthdays and his mother's recent health issues. His wife, Samantha, has had to cancel about two months' worth of jobs for their painting business and their two employees are out of work. Every day, she told NPR, she turns down about five work leads, letting customers know that there is a family emergency. She has instead spent her time working with several attorneys across the country to vacate her husband's conviction, reinstate his green card and release him from detention. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Immigration advocates have argued that the Trump administration's rapid approach to increase arrests and removals reduces the limited due process immigrants get. That due process is in part to minimize the chances of mistakes and prevent someone from being removed when they may have valid claims to stay, they said. Lawyers say the Trump administration has taken steps to undermine due process. Earlier this year, the president said it wasn't possible for all the people he wants to remove to get a trial. Immigration officers have been told to make arrests in court, even as judges told immigrants to come back to their case. And the Homeland Security Department has mandated that immigrants be detained while undergoing their proceedings, with such detention as mandatory for those who entered without legal status. \"Yet there are lots of people in this situation. And there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts regarding re-detention,\" said Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney and another of Surovtsev's lawyers, referring to the  legal avenue for people to claim their detention is unlawful . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The process can be slow, and most people in immigration detention and in immigration court do not have legal representation to argue the particulars of their cases. Lee, the other attorney on Surovtsev's case, said this process shows that the government is trying again to do something it can't: deport Surovtsev to Ukraine. \"The danger here is not simply that people will be sent somewhere wrongly. The danger is that the government is going to do it on purpose in a way that disregards those protections,\" Godshall-Bennett said. \"By disregarding those protections for a subset of individuals, it has opened the door to disregarding them. Period.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The Trump administration wants to deport a million people a year and is placing tens of thousands in immigration detention. As part of the strategy, immigration officers are arresting and detaining those whom the government had previously tried and failed to deport. NPR's immigration policy reporter, Ximena Bustillo, has been following the case of one such detainee. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Samantha Surovtsev met her husband, Roman, in 2017, while jet skiing that summer when they started to date. SAMANTHA SUROVTSEV: He told me about his past and his convictions, and, of course, I had a lot of questions. BUSTILLO: When he was a teenager, Surovtsev pleaded guilty to carjacking charges. He spent a few years in prison, and the green card he had received after coming to the U.S. as a young refugee from the former Soviet Union was revoked. When he was released in 2014, he was handed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. SUROVTSEV: He told me, around that time, that he had spent time in ICE detention. He was a stateless person and that he couldn't be deported anywhere but checks in every year. BUSTILLO: The Surovtsev's lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are considered stateless. They got married, had kids and launched a small commercial painting business in Texas. But after President Trump won the election and there were reports of immigrants being detained at their check-ins, the couple started to worry. SUROVTSEV: There was also fears about detention. Where would he be? How would I be able to contact him? Could I contact him? There were so many unknowns that I could barely function. I was just shaking, fearful, crying. And I'm trying to keep it together for my kids' sake so that they wouldn't know what was going on. It was really hard. BUSTILLO: The morning of the appointment, they arrived early. SUROVTSEV: He doesn't even check in with an officer anymore. He was downgraded to a kiosk because of his situation. It was just basically verifying your information and then walking out. But after about 10 minutes had passed, I knew something else was going on. BUSTILLO: Roman Surovtsev was detained that day at the Dallas ICE field office and eventually transferred to the Bluebonnet Detention Center in north Texas. His wife, Samantha, lawyered up. And since he was detained, lawyers have successfully vacated the carjacking conviction, setting Roman on a path to get his green card back. But they say ICE is still trying to deport him to Ukraine, a country that has not provided any travel documents to return him and is in active war with Russia. Here's Eric Lee, a partner at one of the law firms handling the case. ERIC LEE: He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence. BUSTILLO: Court filings reviewed by NPR showed that ICE tried to provide documentation to Roman, but in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak. Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney on the case, said Surovtsev is not the only one detained after ICE had let them go. CHRIS GODSHALL-BENNETT: There are lots of people in this situation, and there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts, a re-detention. BUSTILLO: Habeas is the legal avenue for people to claim that their detention is unlawful. In court filings, ICE argues that he can be detained because they're trying to get the travel documents for Ukraine. In many ways, Surovtsev's case is unique. Not everyone has this level of legal representation, for example. But in other ways, his case highlights what his wife said every immigrant should have, the due process to argue that they should stay. Here is Samantha. SUROVTSEV: People need to understand that there's a human element involved with immigration, that every story is unique. Every case deserves to be heard in front of a judge. This is not a black-and-white situation. BUSTILLO: In the more than two months that Surovtsev has been in detention, he's missed his wedding anniversary, his wife and daughters' birthdays and his mother's recent health issues. ICE did not respond to NPR's request for comment on Surovtsev's detention, and he remains there while he navigates this complicated legal landscape.

it will consider whether people who regularly smoke marijuana can legally own guns, the latest firearm case to come before the court since  its 2022 decision expanding gun rights .  President Donald Trump’s administration asked the justices to revive a case against a Texas man charged with a felony because he allegedly had a gun in his home and acknowledged being a regular pot user. The Justice Department appealed after  a lower court largely struck down  a law that bars people who use any illegal drugs from having guns.  Last year, a jury  convicted Hunter Biden  of violating the law, among other charges. His father, then-President Joe Biden, later pardoned him. Arguments probably will take place early in 2026, with a decision likely by early summer.

The gun charge was the only one filed, however, and his lawyers said the other allegations were irrelevant and were mentioned only to make him seem more dangerous.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The case marks another flashpoint in the application of the Supreme Court’s new test for firearm restrictions. The conservative majority found in 2022 that the Second Amendment generally gives people the right to carry guns in public for self-defense and any firearm restrictions must have a strong grounding in the nation’s history. The landmark 2022 ruling led to a cascade of challenges to firearm laws around the country, though the justices have since upheld  a different federal law  intended to protect victims of domestic violence by barring guns from people under restraining orders.  ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at  https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-trump-tomahawk-fd61aa7ed980d2fe111f0521073b5382","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:20:36+00:00","title":"Trump Doubts Ukraine Can Defeat Russia, Signals Ceasefire in Upcoming Summit with Putin","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump expressed doubt about Ukraine’s ability to defeat Russia, reversing previous statements that Ukraine should concede territory, and now advocating for a ceasefire and a freeze of the current front lines.

possible that  Ukraine can defeat Russia,  he’s now doubtful it will happen. The comments from Trump added a fresh layer of skepticism toward Kyiv as he plans to  meet again  in the coming weeks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin  for face-to-face talks in Budapest, Hungary, on ending the war. “They could still win it. I don’t think they will, but they could still win it,” Trump told reporters on Monday at the start of  a White House meeting  with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.  Trump last month reversed his long-held position that Ukraine would  have to concede land  and  could win back all the territory  it has lost to Russia.  But after a lengthy call with Putin last week followed by a meeting with Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy , Trump made another reversal and called on Kyiv and Moscow to  “stop where they are”  and end their brutal war. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Asked on Monday about his whiplashing opinion on Kyiv’s position, Trump offered the dour assessment about Ukraine’s chances.

In public comments in the weeks leading up to his meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump had appeared to warm to the possibility of sending the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deeper into Russian territory.  But the U.S. leader’s tone changed after his latest call with Putin and he made clear that he was reluctant to send Ukraine the missile system, at least for the time-being. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “In my opinion, he does not want an escalation with the Russians until he meets with them,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Sunday. His comments were embargoed until Monday morning. Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about Putin’s proposal to swap some territory it holds in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions if Ukraine surrenders Donetsk and Luhansk, saying the proposal was unclear. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the Donbas.  Ukraine’s leader said Trump ultimately supported a freeze along the current front line. “We share President Trump’s positive outlook if it leads to the end of the war,” Zelenskyy said, citing “many rounds of discussion over more than two hours with him and his team.” Zelenskyy was diplomatic about his meeting with Trump despite reports that he faced pressure to accept Putin’s demands. The meeting followed the  disastrous Oval Office spat on Feb. 28  when the Ukrainian president was scolded on live television for not being grateful for U.S. support. Zelenskyy said he hopes that Trump’s  meeting in the coming weeks with Putin in Hungary  — which does not support Ukraine — will pave the way for a peace deal.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Zelenskyy said he has not been invited to attend but would consider it if the format for talks were fair to Kyiv. He also took a shot at Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , saying he does not believe that a prime minister “who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution.” Zelenskyy said he thinks that all parties have “moved closer” to a possible end to the war. “That doesn’t mean it will definitely end, but President Trump has achieved a lot in the Middle East, and riding that wave he wants to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” he added. Ukraine is hoping to purchase 25 Patriot air defense systems from U.S. firms using frozen Russian assets and assistance from partners, but Zelenskyy said procuring them would require time because of long production waits. He said he spoke to Trump about help procuring them more quickly, potentially from European partners. Zelenskyy said the United States is interested in bilateral gas projects with Ukraine, including the construction of an LNG terminal in the southern port city of Odesa. Other projects of interest include those related to nuclear energy and oil. ___ Madhani reported from Washington. ___ Follow the news at  https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ An earlier version of this story has been corrected to show that the referenced Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in the Oval Office was on Feb. 28, not in March."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/iraq-islamic-state-sudani-us-military-advisers-2180dbaf3ea209bd6af32b43c266603d","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:38:07+00:00","title":"Iraq to Keep Small U.S. Military Advisory Presence Amid Regional Security Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has announced that a small group of U.S. military advisers—between 250 and 350 personnel—will remain in Iraq at Ain al-Asad and al-Harir air bases to coordinate counter-ISIS operations in Syria, despite a previously agreed September 2025 pullout.

(AP) —  Iraq  ’s prime minister said Monday that a small contingent of U.S. military advisers will remain in the country for now to coordinate with U.S. forces in neighboring  Syria  combating the  Islamic State  group. Washington and Baghdad agreed last year to wind down a U.S.-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq by this September, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have been stationed. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told journalists in Baghdad that U.S. military advisers and support personnel are now stationed at the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq, a base adjacent to the Baghdad airport, and the al-Harir air base in northern Iraq. Al-Sudani noted that the agreement originally stipulated a full pullout of U.S. forces from Ain al-Asad by September, but that “developments in Syria” since then required maintaining a “small unit” of between 250 and 350 advisers and security personnel at the base. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He said they would work to support counter-IS surveillance and coordination with the al-Tanf base in Syria.

There have been tensions between Baghdad and Washington over the presence of Iran-backed militias in Iraq. The Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of militias that formed to fight IS, was formally placed under the control of the Iraqi military in 2016 but in practice still operates with significant autonomy. The Iraqi parliament has been considering legislation that would solidify the relationship between the military and the PMF, drawing objections from Washington. Al-Sudani did not directly address the proposed legislation but said his government’s program “includes disarmament and national dialogue to remove any justification for carrying weapons.” “We encourage all factions to either integrate into state institutions or engage in political life,” which could include becoming political parties and running for election, he said. Iraq is preparing for parliamentary elections next month that will determine where al-Sudani serves a second term. “Armed factions that have transformed into political entities have the constitutional right to participate” in those elections, the prime minister said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/kevin-federline-book-britney-spears-accb5a36b62b3e746b094a1ee6d2911f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"14:07:35+00:00","title":"Kevin Federline’s Memoir Reveals Controversial Details About Britney Spears and Her Sons","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Federline, former husband of pop star Britney Spears, has released a memoir titled 'You Thought You Knew,' detailing his difficult relationship with Spears, including early romantic encounters, allegations of drug use during parenting, and traumatic experiences involving his sons, Preston and Jayden.

In a memoir to be released Tuesday, “You Thought You Knew,” Federline documents his difficult years as husband, ex-husband, and co-parent with  Spears, who wrote her own memoir  in 2023. Federline’s includes some salacious stories and some potentially disturbing details about her behavior that have already made headlines. “I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there,” Federline, 47, told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview, backed by palm trees in Hawaii, where he now lives with wife Victoria Prince and their two daughters. “That’s a very, very big part of this for me.

She said Federline has engaged in “constant gaslighting.”  “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I’m the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.” She said, adding that “if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking.” She also addressed her relationship with her sons:  “I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys. Relationships with teenage boys is complex. I have felt demoralized by this situation and have always asked and almost begged for them to be a part of my life.

He weighs in on  Spears’ dissolved court conservatorship , saying it was necessary but hurt most of the people involved. He said the fans who fought to free her left an unfortunate legacy. “The Free Britney movement may have started from a good place, but it vilified everyone around her so intensely that now it’s nearly impossible for anyone to step in,” he writes. He says in the book that he wrote it in part as a public plea for her to get more help. “I’ve lost hope that things will ever fully turn around,” he writes, “but I still hope that Britney can find peace.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-campus-assault-facebook-ian-cleary-079f3654d9244ab988929b98462b77e4","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:56:52+00:00","title":"Man Sentenced in 2013 Campus Sexual Assault Case After Decade-Long Legal Battle","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2013, Ian Cleary sexually assaulted Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College, an incident that remained unprosecuted for over a decade due to systemic failures, including lost evidence and prosecutorial reluctance.

(AP) — A man who sent a Facebook message that said,  “So I raped you,”  to a woman he had sexually assaulted in college in 2013 was sentenced to two to four years in prison on Monday. The sentence came more than a year after Ian Cleary was extradited back to Pennsylvania from France over the assault at Gettysburg College and nearly 12 years after the victim first went to police. The judge took into account Cleary’s  guilty plea , his remorse and his long history of mental illness in giving a sentence below state guidelines. Cleary, 32, said he sent the messages as part of a 12-step program, in hopes of seeking atonement. Victim Shannon Keeler told the court on Monday that the messages only reopened wounds she had long carried over the assault, which went years without being prosecuted. “The system meant to protect me protected you instead,” said Keeler, detailing in a powerful 10-minute impact statement the years she spent pursuing charges, which prosecutors are often reluctant to file in campus sexual assault cases. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “This isn’t just my story, this is the story of countless women,” she said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Israel still fires on Lebanon almost a year after a ceasefire.

She was an 18-year-old in her first semester on campus at the time. Senior Judge Kevin Hess said that anyone with daughters or, like him, granddaughters in college would find the crime “horrifying.”  Nevertheless, he said, “the defendant has admitted his guilt, he’s come forward and even though 10 to 11 alarming years have passed in the meantime, we wouldn’t be here today but for his hope for some kind of forgiveness and contrition.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cleary left Gettysburg after the attack and ultimately finished college in Silicon Valley, California, where he’d grown up. He then got a master’s degree and worked for Tesla before moving overseas. In 2019, he sent the Facebook message to Keeler, and she renewed her efforts with police and prosecutors after noticing them a few months later. In 2021,  she shared her experience  in an Associated Press story on the reluctance of prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes. Cleary was indicted weeks after the AP story was published, and following a three-year search, he was extradited from Metz, France, where he had been detained on a vagrancy-related charge in April 2024. In court Monday, Cleary, standing just a few feet away, apologized to Keeler and his father. “I’m committed to getting treatment for mental health and stuff like that as I go forward,” he said. Cleary’s family members have declined to comment on the case and did not attend most of his court hearings.  Keeler, in interviews with the AP, described her repeated efforts to persuade authorities to press charges, starting hours after the assault.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I had been thinking about this moment for 12 years,” Keeler said after seeing Cleary in court in July, when he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault. She called it a surreal moment. Authorities in the U.S. and Europe tried to  track Cleary down  after the indictment but seemed unable to follow his trail, online or otherwise, until his arrest in the unrelated case. Defense lawyer John Abom maintained that Cleary was homeless at times and unaware of the charges. Adams County District Attorney Brian Sinnett said he had his doubts but could not prove that Cleary was on the run. The AP typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Keeler has done. “The system that failed me a decade ago finally delivered accountability, but at a cost. Evidence was lost. Time passed,” she told the court Monday, noting that results of the rape kit she was given that night had been destroyed by the time of the indictment.  “My life moved on, but the impact never went away, not for me, not for my family, not for anyone who had to watch this unfold again and again,” she said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nicolas-sarkozy-prison-france-sante-president-paris-a4016cf6b409fd12c7986118709ddfba","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:53:26+00:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Be Imprisoned for First Time in Living Memory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicolas Sarkozy, the former President of France, is set to become the first in living memory to be imprisoned after being convicted of criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 election campaign.

when he is expected to begin  a five-year sentence  Tuesday in Paris’ La Santé prison. Convicted of criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya, Sarkozy maintains his innocence. Regardless, he will be admitted to  serve his time in a prison  that has held some of the most high-profile inmates since the 19th century. They include Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, wrongly convicted of treason because he was Jewish, and the Venezuelan militant known as Carlos the Jackal, who carried out several attacks on French soil.  Sarkozy told Le Figaro newspaper that he expects to be held in solitary confinement, where he would be kept away from all other prisoners for security reasons.

In an unprecedented judgment, the Paris judge ruled that Sarkozy would start to serve prison time without waiting for his appeal to be heard, due to “the seriousness of the disruption to public order caused by the offense.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Sarkozy to hold his ‘head high’ The former president has denied any wrongdoing and protested the decision that he should be imprisoned pending appeal. “I’m not afraid of prison. I’ll hold my head high, including in front of the doors of La Santé,” Sarkozy told La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. “I’ll fight till the end.” La Tribune Dimanche reports Sarkozy has his prison bag ready with clothes and 10 family photos he is allowed to bring. Sarkozy also told Le Figaro newspaper he would bring three books — the maximum allowed — including “The Count of Monte Cristo” in two volumes and a biography of Jesus Christ. The hero of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” by French author Alexandre Dumas, escapes from an island prison where he spent 14 years before seeking revenge.  One of Sarkozy’s sons, Louis, called for a rally Tuesday morning in support of his father in the high-end Paris neighborhood where Sarkozy lives with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. The supermodel-turned-singer has shared photos of Sarkozy’s children and songs in his honor on her social media feeds since his conviction. Under the ruling, the 70-year-old Sarkozy will only be able to file a request for release to the appeals court once he is behind bars, and judges will then have up to two months to process the request. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n 9-square-meter cells The National Financial Prosecutor’s office told Sarkozy the specifics of his detention last Monday, but details have not been made public. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin confirmed that Sarkozy will enter La Santé on Tuesday and that he’ll personally visit him to make sure security conditions are met.  In the so-called VIP section, Sarkozy could have his own room in one of 18 identical 9-square-meter cells (96.8 square feet) in a wing separated from other general prison inmates.  Botton, who says he has known Sarkozy for decades, expressed doubt that the former president will be accorded many special privileges in prison. “Even if you are president of the Republic, even if you are a very rich man, you decide nothing.” Based on his own experience inside La Santé, about which he wrote the book “QB4,″ Botton described what Sarkozy might expect. After being processed, convicts are handed personal kit by the guards and then led to their cells. “They will open the cell, and (Sarkozy) will discover where he will go,” he said. Botton described the cell he’d lived in La Santé: “A small 70-centimeter (2 feet 4 inches) bed fixed to the floor, a hot plate, a pay refrigerator, a pay TV.” He said that inmates’ rooms in the VIP section were equipped with fixed landline phones they can use to make calls, which are recorded by prison authorities, but they cannot receive calls on the same line. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The shock of incarceration Patrick Balkany, a longtime friend of Sarkozy who spent five months in La Santé for tax evasion in 2019-2020, described the first hours of newly admitted inmates. “They’re going to take his photo, to make him a card because over there we’re a number, we’re no longer a person with a name,” he told RTL radio. Then, “if he’s considered like any other inmate, he undresses and his clothes are searched to make sure he doesn’t have any prohibited items on him,” Balkany said. “The hardest part is when you arrive in your cell, it’s a shock,” he added.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Botton, also, recalled the shock he experienced when his affluent life crumbled when he was sent to prison the first time. “I went for my first time from my 1,200 square meter (around 13,000 square feet) mansion to 9 square meters,’' he said.  From having a private staff of 11 people outside prison, he found himself cleaning a filthy cell when he arrived, he said. “That’s what we call the shock of incarceration.’' “When you are at 7 p.m., you are in jail, alone, and you heard that everything is locked, you are alone,” Botton says. “Everything is finished. The game is finished.” ___ AP writer Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/2025-amazon-web-service-outage-zoom-roblox-down","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:59:15+00:00","title":"Amazon Cloud Outage Exposes Internet’s Vulnerable Backbone","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October 2025 disrupted internet services globally, affecting major platforms such as Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, Robinhood, Netflix, Disney+, and the McDonald’s app. The outage, which began at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and lasted into the afternoon, stemmed from issues in AWS’s Domain Name System (DNS), causing widespread failures in online services.

disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms. The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it  suddenly breaks down . About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was  starting to recover , but it wasn’t until 6 p.m. Eastern that “services returned to normal operations,” Amazon said on its  AWS health  website, where it tracks outages.  AWS provides behind-the-scenes cloud computing infrastructure to some of the world’s biggest organizations. Its customers include government departments, universities and businesses, including The Associated Press. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said “a slow and bumpy recovery process” is “entirely normal.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the Amazon cloud outage that exposed the internet’s vulnerable backbone \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Texas camp owners want more flexibility in meeting safety, licensing requirements after drownings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Silicon Valley leader who navigated the internet’s boom and bust sees another wild ride with AI \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n As engineers roll out fixes across the cloud computing infrastructure, the process could trigger smaller disruptions, he said. “It’s similar to what happens after a large-scale power outage: While a city’s power is coming back online, neighborhoods may see intermittent glitches as crews finish the repairs,” said Chapple, an information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Amazon blames domain name system Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices. DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. Users reported trouble with the social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games, the online broker Robinhood and the McDonald’s app, as well as Netflix, Disney+ and many other services. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Signal chat app both said on X that they were experiencing trouble related to the outage. Amazon’s own services were also affected. Users of the company’s Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers reported that they were not working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle. Many college and K-12 students were unable to submit or access their homework or course materials Monday because the AWS outage knocked out Canvas, a widely used educational platform. “I currently can’t grade any online assignments, and my students can’t access their online materials” because of the outage’s effect on learning-management systems, said Damien P. Williams, a professor of philosophy and data science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The exact number of schools impacted was not immediately known, but Canvas says on its website it is used by 50% of college and university students in North America, including all Ivy League schools in the U.S. At the University of California, Riverside, students couldn’t submit assignments, take quizzes or access course materials, and online instruction was limited, the campus said. Ohio State University informed its 70,000 students at all six campuses by email Monday morning that online course materials might be inaccessible due to the outage and that “students should connect with their instructors for any alternative plans.” As of 7:10 p.m. Eastern, access was restored, the university told students. Record of past outages This is not the first time issues with Amazon cloud services have caused widespread disruptions. Many popular internet services were affected by a brief  outage in 2023 . AWS’s longest outage in recent history occurred in late 2021, when a wide range of companies — from airlines and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services — were affected for  more than five hours . Outages also happened in 2020 and  2017 . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The first signs of trouble emerged at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time, when AWS reported on its “health dashboard” that it was “investigating increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.” Later, the company reported that there were “significant error rates” and that engineers were “actively working” on the problem. Around 6 a.m. Eastern time, the company reported seeing recovery across most of the affected services and said it was seeking a “full resolution.” As of midday, AWS was still working to resolve the trouble. Sixty-four internal AWS services were affected, the company said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Just a few companies provide most internet infrastructure Because much of the world now relies on three or four companies to provide the underlying infrastructure of the internet, “when there’s an issue like this, it can be really impactful” across many online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. “The world now runs on the cloud,” Burgess said. And because so much of the online world’s plumbing is underpinned by so few companies, when something goes wrong, “it’s very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don’t see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,” Burgess said. “The good news is that this kind of issue is usually relatively fast” to resolve, and there’s no indication that it was caused by a cyberattack, Burgess said. “This looks like a good old-fashioned technology issue. Something’s gone wrong, and it will be fixed by Amazon,” he said. There are “well-established processes” to deal with outages at AWS, as well as rivals Google and Microsoft, Burgess said, adding that such outages are usually over in “hours rather than days.” ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco.

Rodrigo Paz,  injected a sharp note of realism into his plans to tackle an economic crisis Monday, a  day after his surprise electoral victory  signaled the  end of decades of leftist rule in the South American nation. After years of government antipathy  toward the U.S. under the Movement Toward Socialism party, Paz pledged to rebuild relations with Washington — and attract foreign investment to a country long locked out of international markets. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Paz’s victory Sunday “marks a transformative opportunity for both nations” to work on investment, immigration, security and other matters.  “The message from Mr. Trump’s administration itself is a very clear and open signal,” Paz said at a news conference. “We will have a fluid relationship and commitments to cooperation and joint work between both nations.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In another sign of the dramatic regional shift, Paz held a video call with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won  the Nobel Peace Prize this month . After years of Bolivia aligning itself with Venezuela’s  increasingly repressive  President Nicolás Maduro, Paz told Machado that his country was “here to join in the fight for Venezuela and for Latin American democracies.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about Rodrigo Paz, the centrist who shot from obscurity to Bolivia’s presidency \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Rodrigo Paz wins presidential runoff, becoming Bolivia’s first conservative leader in decades \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 After years of socialist rule, Bolivia’s presidential runoff tests how far and fast it veers right \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “These are very difficult times; here we have achieved a great step,” he said of Bolivia’s break with socialism.

Quiroga pitched having the International Monetary Fund  impose a fiscal shock package to right the economy, an unpopular move with many voters. Sensitive to the country’s deep-seated resentment of such international organizations under leftist rule, Paz rejected an IMF bailout. He did reveal Monday that he was talking to the Trump administration — among “other friendly countries” — to ensure Bolivia would have fuel imports after he takes office. “The process is underway. We are coordinating in the best way possible so that the much-needed fuel — gasoline and diesel — can arrive, and from that, we can bring calm to the population,” Paz said, without elaborating.  The commodities boom of the early 2000s sent money flowing into Bolivia under then-  President Evo Morales  as natural gas exports surged. But production slumped and, amid profligate spending on subsidies,  the central bank has practically run out of U.S. dollars .  Without the cash to pay for imports, fuel lines stretch along the streets of major cities. Year-on-year  inflation soared  to 23% in September, the highest rate since 1991.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An underdog lures former leftists to the right Paz — the son of former leftist President Jaime Paz Zamora — was a political unknown in the early stages of the campaign despite his two decades in politics, first as a mayor, then as a senator. But his pick as a running mate of Edman Lara,  a social media-savvy former police captain, transformed his campaign, solidifying his appeal to working-class and rural voters who saw themselves in Lara’s own humble origin story and in his public struggles against what they see as a corrupt establishment.  Lara gained fame on TikTok in 2023 after being fired from the police force for denouncing corruption in viral videos.  Lara made populist promises like pension increases and cash handouts for the poor that flew in the face of Paz’s grim economic arithmetic, but he helped differentiate Paz from Quiroga and whipped up excitement among many Bolivians who once belonged to the MAS party. Morales, who governed for 14 years and was barred from this race due to a  contentious court ruling on term limits , warned Paz and Lara on Monday that winning the votes of his former followers comes at a price. “It does not give you a blank check,” Morales said. “It is a vote with a mandate ... not to apply neoliberal measures, not to submit to imperialism, not to be repressive, not to criminalize protest.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Saving finances from the brink of disaster On Monday, Paz spoke soberly about the importance of cleaning house and restoring faith in Bolivia’s corruption-riddled institutions before making any splashy promises. The leader of Paz’s economic team, José Gabriel Espinoza, told the AP that cash handouts for the poor were still financially feasible to help cushion the blow of lifting the country’s expensive fuel subsidies.  Espinoza said that Congress had already approved a $3.5 billion loan to be disbursed over the coming months and that Paz is working on another $600 million to balance the books within the first 60 days of his presidency.  “Today we have a blind subsidy, we subsidize fuel for everyone. So what we’ll do is target the subsidy to poorer families through direct cash transfers, while keeping gasoline prices stable for transport workers,” said Espinoza.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Putting the house in order When asked how he would draw foreign investment and take on foreign debt, Paz repeated: “First you put the house in order quickly.” That involves changing Bolivia’s Constitution, he said, a prospect that has stirred fears among the country’s Indigenous majority who finally found political representation in the 2005 election of MAS party founder Morales as  the country’s first Indigenous president . Under Morales, a 2009 constitution gave Indigenous and other grassroots groups a bigger role in electoral politics and decision-making after years of being treated as second-class citizens by Bolivia’s largely white and mestizo, or mixed-race, minority. The constitution also overhauled the judicial system, making it more vulnerable to political influence.  Paz promised that his government would respect its commitment to the Indigenous majority but prioritize  changes in a judiciary  that for years has been seen as a political prize to be won rather than a check on government power. He pledged to convene a summit to produce concrete proposals the day after his inauguration.  To contain any frustration at his inability to fulfill his promises in the short term while pushing through difficult reforms, experts say that Paz will need to show the negotiating powers that he boasted of in his campaign. He appeared aware of that in Monday’s news conference, saying that he and Lara “have extended our hand to all political forces in Parliament.” The street may be another matter.  Late Monday, scattered protests against the election result erupted outside the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in Bolivia’s capital of La Paz. Scores of Quiroga supporters wrapped themselves in national flags and chanted “Fraud, fraud, fraud!” Local media aired footage of other protests igniting in the prosperous eastern region of Santa Cruz. “I don’t trust it at all,” said Shelly Sánchez, 48, one of the protesters in La Paz, explaining that she lost faith in Bolivia’s electoral politics after  Morales’ disputed 2019 reelection  that  sparked suspicions of fraud  and prompted mass protests that  led to his ouster  under pressure from the military.  “They’re all the same.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/doug-martin-death-police-e17d1269aeb4f62fdc8c97d84bd00a19","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:06:49+00:00","title":"Former NFL Star Doug Martin Dies After Police Arrest During Break-In Investigation in Oakland","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug Martin, a former NFL running back known for his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, died after being taken into custody by Oakland police during an investigation into a break-in.

(AP) — Former All-Pro NFL running back  Doug Martin died  after a struggle with police officers who were taking him into custody while they were investigating a break-in at a home in Oakland, police said Monday.  Martin, best known for his stellar career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, became unresponsive after being arrested early Saturday, according to a statement released by the Oakland Police Department.

shoot up the place, and found an assault rifle and ammunition in his truck outside, the city’s police chief said. Billy Joe Cagle, of Cartersville, Georgia, had described his plan to shoot up the world’s  busiest airport  on a social media livestream, Chief Darin Schierbaum said during a news conference. “The Cartersville Police Department was alerted by the family of Mr. Cagle that he was streaming on social media that he was headed to the Atlanta airport, in their words, to ‘shoot it up,’ and the family stated that he was in possession of an assault rifle,” Schierbaum said, describing Cagle as a “convicted felon.” Cagle, 49, arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in a Chevrolet pickup truck that was parked right outside the doors to the airport terminal. When police went to the vehicle, they found an AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition, Schierbaum said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We’re here today briefing you on a success and not a tragedy because a family saw something and said something,” the chief said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Man killed by tree branch, pedestrian blown into road as storm buffets Wellington, New Zealand \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A man took videos as his home floated away with him inside in Alaska’s storms \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Springer’s homer sends Blue Jays into World Series with 4-3 win over Mariners in Game 7 of ALCS \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Cartersville police Capt.

Attempts to reach his family and co-workers through multiple phone numbers and emails were unsuccessful. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had a lawyer who could comment on the charges. Nick Roberts, who has known Cagle since high school, texted his friend Sunday night after being concerned by Facebook posts he had made. He said Cagle was struggling with mental health issues. Cagle had posted on Facebook earlier Sunday that he is schizophrenic and was taking medication. Roberts said Cagle called him at about 9 p.m. Sunday night and assured him he was OK. Roberts said Cagle loved his two daughters and worked hard hauling hay and doing fencing work. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I want folks to know that he wasn’t some monster,” Roberts said. “This was a very big surprise for a lot of us that went to high school with him and know him in the community.” Atlanta police will work with federal authorities to determine how he obtained the gun, “which he was not able to legally possess,” Schierbaum said.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping delivered a speech Monday on the opening day of  a major meeting  of the ruling Communist Party to approve a draft plan laying out its goals for the country over the next five years. A short dispatch from the official Xinhua News Agency said Xi “expounded on the Party leadership’s draft proposals” for the next five-year plan for national economic and social development, which will cover 2026-2030.

The latest plan comes at a time of growing challenges and uncertainty for China, including a  persistently sluggish economy , foreign restrictions on its access to the latest technologies and high tariffs imposed on its exports to the United States. A Xinhua editorial said that the plan should focus on “high-quality” development and technological innovation, while also ensuring national security is protected and the benefits of economic growth are spread fairly and more widely. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “There will be hardships and obstacles on our way forward, and we may encounter major tests,” the editorial said in discussing economic and national security goals. “We must be prepared to deal with a series of new risks and challenges.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump is going to Asia — what happens next is anyone’s guess \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Trump vows to reach a ‘fantastic deal’ with China after future meeting with Xi \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 China’s economy slows to 4.8% annual growth in July-September, hit by tariffs and slack demand \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Analysts and investors are watching the meeting to look for clues about how the plan will balance economic and security interests, and to what extent the plan will call for structural changes to boost consumer spending and manage an aging society. \n    \n     ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n This week’s four-day meeting brings together about 200 voting members and 170 alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The body will approve the draft five-year plan, though full details likely won’t be released until it is formally approved at the legislature’s next annual meeting, expected in March.

agreed to maintain a permanent dialogue as they press for a  zero-tolerance  policy for abuse in the Catholic Church. Ending Clergy Abuse is a global organization that has been campaigning to universalize the U.S. church’s abuse policy. Among other things, the policy calls for the  permanent removal from ministry  of a priest based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established according to church law. The U.S. policy, first articulated in the 1990s, was publicly adopted at the height of the scandal there in a bid to restore trust and credibility in the U.S. hierarchy after revelations of decades of abuse and cover-up. It is church law in the United States but is not embraced elsewhere. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Leo acknowledged “there was great resistance” to the idea of a universal zero-tolerance law, said Tim Law, ECA co-founder. But Law said he told Leo that ECA wanted to work with him and the Vatican to move the idea forward. Leo has met before with clergy abuse survivors, and was the point person for listening to victims in the Peruvian bishops conference when he was a bishop there. But history’s first American pope acknowledged the significance of meeting with ECA as an activist organization, members told a press conference. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Pope gives Venezuela reason to celebrate by canonizing its beloved ‘doctor of the poor’ as 1st saint \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 King Charles III’s visit to Vatican marks a historic step in path of unity between two churches \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Pope denounces use of hunger as weapon of war as he urges world leaders ‘not to look the other way’ \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Pope Francis  and Pope Benedict XVI before him also met with individual victims but had kept activist and advocacy groups at arm’s length. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “He said, ‘This is the next historic step: to sit together and talk,’” said German participant Matthias Katsch of Monday’s meeting. “He allowed us to stay in contact, to have an open channel of communications.” The audience inside the Apostolic Palace lasted an hour and Leo listened intently, participants said.

But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking  Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,  or LEAP, trial. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. “This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education, or FARE. The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. “It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her two young sons.  At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. “As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.” ——- This story has been corrected to report that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies after doctors began recommending introducing the peanuts to babies, not 60,000.  ——- The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

2025-10-19T03:01:22+00:00\n\nHONG KONG (AP) — One of China’s most important meetings begins Monday, as leader Xi Jinping and other ruling Communist Party elites gather to map the goals for the next five years. The closed-door gathering — known as the fourth plenum — is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China’s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030. The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened  trade tensions  between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month. Here is what to know about the meeting: \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n What the fourth plenum is and why it matters The fourth plenum refers to the fourth plenary session, out of typically seven during the five-year term of the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee. Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend. The gathering also may coincide with personnel changes. Since it’s held behind closed doors, details may come days or weeks later.  Such gatherings are meant to help unite officials and the public behind the party’s agenda. The full five-year plan for 2026-2030 and specifics will likely not be released until the annual session of the National People’s Congress in March. But there is little reason to expect a radical shift from the format and messaging style of previous  five-year plans , Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said in an interview. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n What to expect in China’s next ‘five-year plan’ The world’s second-largest economy is forecast to expand by 4.8% this year, according to the World Bank, a figure close to China’s official target of about 5% annual growth. Growth in July-September  slowed to 4.8%,  the lowest pace in a year. China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.  Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China’s push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.  China’s pursuit of technological “self-sufficiency,” weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs. That could result in more spending on advanced technology, said Ning Zhang, a senior China economist at UBS. One key question is whether there will be any meaningful shift in the leadership’s approach to boosting consumption, said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics. The government has adopted incremental policy moves — such as increased government subsidies for child care, consumer loans, and trade-in programs for appliances and electric vehicles. Boosting consumption, which would drive borrowing and demand, is “much more important than before” but consumer confidence has been undermined by the bursting of  China’s property bubble  several years ago, Zhang explained. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Economists say bolder moves are needed to make a significant difference. Price wars in the auto industry are an example of the risks of the ferocious competition that results from overcapacity that afflicts many Chinese industries. China’s  exports  — including to Southeast Asia and Africa — have surged as companies seek markets beyond its borders, adding to friction with the United States and other trading partners.  China’s chief challenges in the next five years Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen. Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care. “Overall, China’s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,” she wrote. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While it faces  increasing friction  with the U.S. and other trading partners, China is also running up against demographic pressures, as its population of 1.4 billion begins to shrink and age more rapidly. The unemployment rate for young workers aged 16-24 is nearly 19%, according to official data, impinging on their potential contributions to the economy. The Chinese leadership has set a goal of doubling the size of China’s economy in 2020 by 2035, and like any other government, “still cares (about) growth and is still trying to get richer,” said Zhang of UBS.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He estimates that keeping the economy growing at a robust 4% to 5% pace in the next decade will likely be “challenging.” But it’s imperative to show it is striving for such ambitious goals, to demonstrate the ruling party’s capacity to keep delivering a better quality of life — its chief claim to its legitimacy.  “For China’s leadership, what do they care about? Stability, legitimacy, and also ongoing support,” he said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/amazon-east-internet-services-outage-654a12ac9aff0bf4b9dc0e22499d92d7","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:59:15+00:00","title":"Amazon Cloud Outage Exposes Internet’s Fragile Backbone","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage on October 20, 2025, beginning at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time and resolving by 6 p.m. Eastern time, affecting over 2,500 companies and disrupting services including social media (Snapchat), gaming (Roblox, Fortnite), financial platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase), streaming (Netflix, Disney+), and educational platforms (Canvas).

massive outage of its  cloud computing service  has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms. The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it  suddenly breaks down . About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was  starting to recover , but it wasn’t until 6 p.m. Eastern that “services returned to normal operations,” Amazon said on its  AWS health  website, where it tracks outages.  AWS provides behind-the-scenes cloud computing infrastructure to some of the world’s biggest organizations. Its customers include government departments, universities and businesses, including The Associated Press. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said “a slow and bumpy recovery process” is “entirely normal.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the Amazon cloud outage that exposed the internet’s vulnerable backbone \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Texas camp owners want more flexibility in meeting safety, licensing requirements after drownings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Silicon Valley leader who navigated the internet’s boom and bust sees another wild ride with AI \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n As engineers roll out fixes across the cloud computing infrastructure, the process could trigger smaller disruptions, he said. “It’s similar to what happens after a large-scale power outage: While a city’s power is coming back online, neighborhoods may see intermittent glitches as crews finish the repairs,” said Chapple, an information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Amazon blames domain name system Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices. DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. Users reported trouble with the social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games, the online broker Robinhood and the McDonald’s app, as well as Netflix, Disney+ and many other services. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Signal chat app both said on X that they were experiencing trouble related to the outage. Amazon’s own services were also affected. Users of the company’s Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers reported that they were not working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle. Many college and K-12 students were unable to submit or access their homework or course materials Monday because the AWS outage knocked out Canvas, a widely used educational platform. “I currently can’t grade any online assignments, and my students can’t access their online materials” because of the outage’s effect on learning-management systems, said Damien P. Williams, a professor of philosophy and data science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The exact number of schools impacted was not immediately known, but Canvas says on its website it is used by 50% of college and university students in North America, including all Ivy League schools in the U.S. At the University of California, Riverside, students couldn’t submit assignments, take quizzes or access course materials, and online instruction was limited, the campus said. Ohio State University informed its 70,000 students at all six campuses by email Monday morning that online course materials might be inaccessible due to the outage and that “students should connect with their instructors for any alternative plans.” As of 7:10 p.m. Eastern, access was restored, the university told students. Record of past outages This is not the first time issues with Amazon cloud services have caused widespread disruptions. Many popular internet services were affected by a brief  outage in 2023 . AWS’s longest outage in recent history occurred in late 2021, when a wide range of companies — from airlines and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services — were affected for  more than five hours .

And because so much of the online world’s plumbing is underpinned by so few companies, when something goes wrong, “it’s very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don’t see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,” Burgess said. “The good news is that this kind of issue is usually relatively fast” to resolve, and there’s no indication that it was caused by a cyberattack, Burgess said. “This looks like a good old-fashioned technology issue. Something’s gone wrong, and it will be fixed by Amazon,” he said. There are “well-established processes” to deal with outages at AWS, as well as rivals Google and Microsoft, Burgess said, adding that such outages are usually over in “hours rather than days.” ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco.

critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/how-indigenous-knowledge-is-aiding-pakistans-fight-against-climate-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"05:27:09+00:00","title":"How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northern Pakistan, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge systems — such as observing animal behavior, unusual weather patterns, and using traditional signals like gunfire — are being used by local shepherds to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

2025-10-13T05:27:09+00:00\n\nTitle: How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/colombia-recalls-ambassador-to-united-states-amid-diplomatic-spat","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"14:22:37+00:00","title":"Colombia recalls ambassador to United States amid diplomatic spat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States in a strong diplomatic response to threats from President Donald Trump, who accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut off aid and conduct military operations in Colombian waters.

a funicular railcar that  crashed  in Lisbon killing 16 people last month had a faulty cable and recommended that the city’s other funiculars remain closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe report,

However, safety recommendations are not expected to be provided until the bureau issues its final report on the incident within the next year.\n\nThe GPIAAF said that inspectors would need to confirm that the funicular car’s braking systems were “capable of immobilising the cabins in the event of a cable break”.\n\nThe  accident on September 3  occurred on the 19th century Gloria tramway, which is popular with tourists. The dead included five Portuguese and 11 foreigners: three from the United Kingdom, two Canadians, two South Koreans, one American, one Frenchwoman, one Swiss and one Ukrainian.\n\nAbout 20 people were also injured in the accident.\n\nA note published by the GPIAAF three days after the crash found that a cable linking two cabins disconnected before the disaster. The latest investigation has found that the “cable did not comply with the specifications in force at the CCFL [Lisbon’s transport operator] to be used for the Gloria tram”.\n\nThe investigation found that the driver of the funicular had activated the brakes, but that they were not able to stop the carriage from derailing.\n\nThe faulty cable led to a carriage derailing at 6:15pm local time (17:15 GMT), before speeding down a steep slope and crashing into a building.\n\nThe carriage toppled onto its side after the crash, with the sides and roof of the carriage partly crumpled by the impact.\n\nThe Gloria was opened in 1885 and travelled up and down one of Lisbon’s many well-known steep hills.

It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days.

2028\n\nEuropean Union states have agreed to halt Russian oil and gas imports by 2028, severing an energy link they fear helps fuel Moscow’s war in Ukraine.\n\nAlmost all EU energy ministers voted in favour of the draft regulation, which applies to both pipeline oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), during a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\nIt would require EU members to phase out new Russian gas import contracts from January 2026, existing short-term contracts from June 2026 and long-term contracts in January 2028.\n\nThe proposal must now be approved by the European Parliament, where it is expected to pass.\n\nThe plan is part of a broader EU strategy to curb Russian energy dependence amid the war in Ukraine – and follows persistent  calls by United States President Donald Trump  for European states to stop “funding the war against themselves”.\n\nLars Aagaard, Denmark’s energy minister, called the proposal a “crucial” step to make Europe energy independent.\n\n“Although we have worked hard and pushed to get Russian gas and oil out of Europe in recent years, we are not there yet,” Aagaard said. His country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency.\n\nThe EU has already brought down Russian oil imports to just 3 percent of its overall share, but Russian gas still makes up 13 percent of gas imports, accounting for more than 15 billion euros ($17.5bn) annually, according to the European Council.\n\nNevertheless, these purchases make up a relatively small portion of Russia’s overall fossil fuel exports, which mostly go to China, India and Turkiye, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nThe EU countries  importing the most Russian energy  are Hungary and Slovakia, followed by France, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nHungary and Slovakia – which are diplomatically closer to Moscow – both opposed the latest EU initiative, but it only needed a weighted majority of 15 states to pass, meaning they could not block it.\n\n“The real impact of this regulation is that our safe supply of energy in Hungary is going to be killed,” Budapest’s top diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.\n\nThe text approved on Monday allowed specific flexibilities for landlocked member states, which include Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nIn addition to the trade restrictions, the EU is negotiating a new package of sanctions against Russia that would ban LNG imports one year earlier, from January 2027.\n\nThe EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas, said earlier on Monday the new sanctions package could be approved as early as this week."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese technology group Wingtech, by invoking the highly exceptional Goods Availability Act.

2025-10-14T13:37:55+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29+00:00","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China’s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals, which Beijing justified as a national security measure in retaliation for U.S. trade restrictions and targeting of Chinese industries.

Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the

adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/israel-continues-deadly-breaches-of-gaza-truce-as-us-seeks-to-salvage-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"23:13:07+00:00","title":"Israel continues deadly Gaza truce breaches as US seeks to strengthen deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a fragile US-brokered ceasefire beginning on October 10, 2025, Israel has continued air strikes and shootings in Gaza, including attacks in al-Shaaf and Shujayea, claiming retaliation for Hamas violations such as alleged attacks in Rafah.

strikes and shootings in Gaza, raising fears over the future of its fragile  ceasefire deal  with Hamas, as United States envoys ramp up diplomacy to get the deal back on track.\n\nThe Palestinian Civil Defence agency said that four people were killed in two separate attacks, both times “by Israeli gunfire as they were returning to check on their homes” in the al-Shaaf area, east of Tuffah

which Israeli troops pulled back and remain stationed under the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.\n\nGaza City residents reported confusion over the line’s location because of a lack of a visible boundary. “The whole area is in ruins.

Israel said the strikes were in retaliation for a truce violation by Hamas fighters, who it claimed shot and killed two Israeli soldiers in Rafah.\n\nHamas denied involvement in the event, saying it has no contact with any of its remaining units in Israeli-controlled parts of Rafah and “is not responsible for any incidents” there.

China doesn’t want to do that,” he told reporters as he met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\nWhile Trump conceded that China had designs on Taiwan, describing it as the apple of Xi’s eye, he said the country would be deterred from invading, given its awareness that the US “is the strongest military power in the world by far”.\n\n“We have the best of everything, and nobody’s going to mess with that,” Trump said.\n\nHe declined to answer a question on whether he would sacrifice US support for Taiwan as part of an agreement with Xi.\n\nBack in June, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had called China a “ threat to the region ” at the high-profile Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs hit back. “The US should not entertain illusions about using the Taiwan question as a bargaining chip to contain China, nor should it play with fire,” it said.\n\nChina has long claimed self-governing Taiwan, which split off from the mainland during a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control.\n\nThe Chinese military regularly sends fighter jets and warships into the skies and waters off Taiwan and has staged major military exercises in the area in recent years.\n\nThe US, like most countries in the world, does not recognise Taiwan as a country, but remains the most important international backer of the flourishing democracy and technology hub.\n\nUnder US law, Washington is required to provide Taiwan with weapons for its self-defence.

2025-10-20T22:58:56+00:00\n\nTitle: US court says Trump can command Oregon troops, but deployment still on hold\n\nA United States court of appeals has ruled that the administration of President  Donald Trump  can move forward with plans to deploy soldiers to Portland, Oregon, although another earlier ruling still bars it from doing so, for now.\n\nThe Monday ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court will allow the Trump administration to send 200  National Guard members  to the Democrat-run city, despite the absence of any serious emergency and the objections of state and local officials.\n\nIt comes after Trump’s Department of Justice appealed the first of two rulings from US District Judge Karin Immergut, prohibiting Trump from calling up the troops so he could send them to Portland.\n\n“After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority” when he federalised the state’s National Guard, the Court of Appeals wrote in its majority opinion, supported by two judges out of a panel of three.\n\nAnother temporary restraining order, which prohibits the president from sending any National Guard members to Oregon at all, and which was issued by Immergut after Trump tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead, remains in place.\n\nSoon after the ruling on Monday, the Justice Department asked Immergut to immediately dissolve her second order, arguing that it is not the role of the courts to second-guess the president’s determination about when to deploy troops.\n\nOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, said he would ask for a broader panel of the appeals court to reconsider Monday’s decision.\n\n“Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,” Rayfield said. “We are on a dangerous path in America.”\n\nThe Trump administration has deployed armed forces to Democrat-run cities across the country, along with aggressive  immigration raids  in which heavily-armed federal agents wearing masks have pulled people off the streets, demanding that they prove their legal status.\n\nMany US citizens have also been swept up in those raids, during which civil liberty groups have accused immigration agents of operating based on racial profiling, and detaining people without cause.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) expressed disappointment in the court’s decision.\n\n“As the founders emphasised, domestic deployment of troops should be reserved for rare, extreme emergencies as a last resort, but that is far from what the Trump administration is doing in Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, and DC,” Hina Shamsi, the director of the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement.\n\n“The presence of troops in otherwise beautiful vibrant American cities erodes a sense of safety and undermines the core freedoms to assemble and voice dissent.”\n\nThe  Trump administration  has claimed that Portland is “war-ravaged” by protesters, who it says are blocking immigration enforcement measures, despite the absence of any serious crisis conditions in the city. Trump and his allies have often employed vague allegations of emergency conditions as a pretext for wielding extraordinary powers both at home and abroad.\n\nDemonstrators have worn costumes while protesting outside of immigration facilities, sometimes donning dinosaur and frog outfits and blasting music.

A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2110-10-21","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent news article from Al Jazeera highlights a range of developments in science and technology, including a major AWS outage that disrupted internet services, U.S. efforts to restrict China’s access to semiconductor technology, a climate change series with innovative solutions, widespread misinformation spread via social media influencers using AI-generated content, a new U.S. transparency law criticized as 'light touch,' strategic trade negotiations with the U.S., the Nobel Prize awarded to chemist Omar M.

team Maccabi Tel Aviv has said it will turn down any tickets offered to its fans for a match in the United Kingdom, even if an earlier decision by local officials  to bar the team’s followers  from attending is reversed.\n\nMaccabi Tel Aviv said on Monday that “hard lessons learned” meant it had decided to decline any offer of tickets for the Europa League game against Aston Villa.\n\n“The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount,” the team said in a statement posted online. “Our decision should be understood in that context.”\n\nThe club also said it had been working to “stamp out racism” within the “more extreme elements” of its fan base.\n\n“Our first-team squad consists of Muslims, Christian and Jewish players and our fan base also crosses the ethnic and religious divide,” it said.\n\nThe team’s decision came a day after Israeli police cancelled a match between Maccabi and its rival Tel Aviv team Hapoel before kickoff over what they described as “public disorder and violent riots”.\n\nThe move by Israeli authorities to cancel the game stood in contrast with criticism by British and Israeli leaders of Birmingham City’s decision to ban Maccabi fans from the November 6 match at Villa Park in Birmingham, central England.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the ban by the city’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) “the wrong decision”, while Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar called for the “shameful” and “coward decision” to be reversed.\n\nThe UK government said on Friday that it was working to override local authorities to allow Israeli fans to be present.\n\nBut after Israeli police shut down the match between Tel Aviv teams on Sunday, some UK politicians questioned whether the government should intervene in Birmingham.\n\n“To Keir Starmer and others who tried to make this about religion! Here’s more evidence. Even under the world’s spotlight, these fans chose violence, injuring police officers,” independent MP Ayoub Khan wrote in a post on X.\n\nRichard Burgon, a Labour MP, broke with his government, saying the developments vindicated the decision to ban away fans from attending the game.\n\n“This news exposes how absurd that campaign has been,” he said on X. “The people of Birmingham have a right to be kept safe.”\n\nWest Midlands Police said last week that they had classified the match as high risk based on “current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the  2024 UEFA Europa League match  between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam”.\n\n“Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” the police force said.\n\nLast year’s clashes in Amsterdam between pro-Palestinian supporters and fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv led to dozens of arrests.\n\nThe clashes followed incidents of  Israeli fans  rampaging through the Dutch capital, assaulting residents, destroying symbols of Palestinian solidarity and chanting racist and genocidal slogans against Palestinians and Arabs.\n\nThe clashes also featured reported incidents of anti-Semitism, including a private messaging chat calling for a “Jew hunt”.\n\nLegal experts have also voiced concerns about Israeli teams participating in international sporting matches, citing a report by United Nations investigators that affirmed that Israel is carrying out a genocide  against Palestinians .\n\nEarlier this month, more than  30 legal experts wrote  to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, saying that banning Israel from competitions was “imperative”.\n\n“UEFA must not be complicit in sports-washing such flagrant breaches of international law, including but not limited to the act of genocide,” the experts wrote."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call for improved early-warning systems for extreme weather events, warning that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities.

India  – On the evening of September 4, an illuminated signboard lit up a predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in Kanpur, an industrial town in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe signboard said: “I love Muhammad” – with a red heart standing in for the word, love.\n\nIt was the first time the mainly working-class residents in Kanpur’s Syed Nagar had put up such a sign as part of the decorations as they joined millions of Muslims around the world to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday.\n\nThe day, marked as Eid Milad-un-Nabi across South Asia, involves the faithful organising religious gatherings, Quran recitations, and sermons about the prophet’s life and teachings. At some places, the celebrations include mass processions, with people carrying posters to express their love and reverence for the prophet.\n\nIn Syed Nagar, however, as soon as the words glowed, a group of Hindu men swooped in,  objecting to the celebration . Police were called in, and following a ruckus that lasted hours, the signboard was removed late that night.\n\nCharges related to promoting enmity between different religious groups, as well as deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of another community, were filed against nine Muslim men and 15 unidentified people from Syed Nagar. No arrests have been made so far.\n\nMohit Bajpayee, a Syed Nagar resident affiliated with a Hindu group named Sri Ramnavmi Samiti, said he had no objection to the text, ‘I love Muhammad’, but to the placement of the signboard at a place used by them for a Hindu festival.\n\n“All religions have equal rights under the constitution,” he told Al Jazeera. “But the sign was put up at a location where our Ram Navami decorations are usually displayed. Everyone has a right to follow their religion, but new traditions should not be started in new locations.”\n\nBut the Muslim residents of Syed Nagar say the signboard was put up at a public place they converged at every year for the prophet’s birth anniversary.\n\n“We had official permission for the decorations. Everyone has the right to practise their religion under the constitution,” said a 28-year-old resident who is one of those charged, unwilling to reveal his identity over fears of further action by the government.\n\nMA Khan, the lawyer for the accused in Kanpur, told Al Jazeera that the Muslim men were also accused of tearing a banner of the Hindu community during the Eid Milad-un-Nabi procession on September 5.\n\n“Many of those named were not even present in the procession,” he said.\n\nUttar Pradesh is home to 38 million Muslims – more than the entire population of Saudi Arabia – comprising nearly 20 percent of India’s most populous state. Since 2017, the politically crucial state has been governed by Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk known for his anti-Muslim speech and policies, and a prominent politician from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nDays later, the spark from Kanpur ignited a fire some 270km (168 miles) away, in another Uttar Pradesh town called Bareilly – headquarters of the Barelvi sect of Sunni Muslims, who number between 200 million to 300 million across the world.\n\nOn September 10, the state police registered a first information report (FIR) against nine Muslims in Bareilly, including a religious scholar, accusing them of “disturbing communal harmony” and starting a “new tradition” that threatened public order.\n\nOn September 21, Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan, chief of a Muslim group called Ittehad-e-Millat Council (IMC) and descendant of Imam Ahmed Raza Khan, the founder of the Barelvi sect, announced a protest over the FIRs filed in Bareilly and Kanpur, and urged his supporters to gather at a ground after Friday prayers on September 26 to denounce the police action.\n\nThe district administration denied Khan permission for the rally.\n\nOn September 25, the IMC issued a statement asking people not to gather for the protest. But hours later, Khan’s supporters allegedly circulated a social media message, claiming the IMC statement was fake and aimed at defaming the Muslim body.\n\nThe next day, thousands of Muslims assembled near a famous Muslim shrine in Bareilly after the Friday prayers, holding “I love Muhammad” posters and raising slogans against the police for their action in Kanpur.\n\nDistrict authorities alleged that the march was unauthorised and accused some participants of pelting stones at the police and vandalising public property. The police responded with a baton charge, and arrested Khan and dozens of others, as authorities shut down the internet in the town.\n\nIn a video message recorded before his arrest, Khan said the crackdown was a targeted suppression of religious expression. “Attempts to suppress our religious sentiments will backfire,” he warned.\n\nA day later, while speaking at an event in the state capital, Lucknow, Chief Minister Adityanath condemned the Bareilly unrest as a “well-orchestrated attempt” to disturb social harmony.\n\n“Sometimes, people are not able to shun their bad habits easily. For that, some denting-painting is required … You saw that in Bareilly yesterday. A maulana [Muslim scholar] forgot who is in power,” he said in Hindi, without naming anyone.\n\nThe “denting-painting” soon followed, as has been the pattern with Adityanath’s crackdown on Muslims accused of disrupting public order. A banquet hall belonging to one of the accused was bulldozed by the authorities in Bareilly.\n\nDemolition of homes and commercial properties belonging to Muslims accused of a range of crimes has become a common practice in Uttar Pradesh and other BJP-ruled states, despite India’s top court recently banning what it called the “bulldozer justice”. Rights groups say such demolitions are a form of extralegal punishment that bypasses judicial processes and devastates families economically.\n\nWhile the Uttar Pradesh government claimed the demolitions in Bareilly targeted illegally-constructed buildings, the timing and targets suggest a clear strategy of intimidation.\n\n“Police are registering cases against Muslims across the nation to suppress their legitimate protests … The BJP government wants to instil fear so Muslims lose the courage to speak for their religious and fundamental rights,” Sumaiya Rana, daughter of the famous Urdu poet late Munawwar Rana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nRana herself organised a protest outside the state assembly building in Lucknow, where more than a dozen demonstrators holding “I love Muhammad” placards were briefly detained by the police.\n\nThe Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), a rights group, says at least 22 FIRs have been filed across India in connection with the Muslim campaign, naming more than 2,500 individuals, with at least 89 arrested in Bareilly so far.\n\n“Authorities have treated a slogan expressing love for the prophet as a criminal act and described it as provocative,” APCR secretary Nadeem Khan told Al Jazeera. “In many cases, the administration violated due process in registering cases and demolishing the properties of the accused, which has severe social and economic impacts on Muslim communities.”\n\nSQR Ilyasi, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a prominent Muslim body, stressed that peaceful protest is not illegal for any community in India. “Expressing love for the prophet is our right,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nActivist Vandana Mishra of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, a rights group, said the authorities frequently allow the Hindu community to “raise religious slogans freely, while the minority faces arrest for expressing love for the prophet”.\n\n“This contravenes the secular and democratic ethos of our constitution,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nOpposition parties have also criticised the Uttar Pradesh government’s actions.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party, one of the state’s biggest political forces, said it attempted to send a delegation to Bareilly to meet the victims of the police crackdown, but claimed its members were prevented. “The government talks of democracy but acts in complete disregard of it,” the leader of the opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Mata Prasad Pandey, told reporters in Lucknow.\n\nLawyer Zia Jillani, who recently visited Bareilly and is representing some of the accused, told Al Jazeera that most of those arrested or facing charges “belong to the marginalised sections of society and earn on a daily wage basis”.\n\n“For them, due to their financial incapability, pursuing and fighting legal cases against the injustices inflicted upon them is an unbearable task,” he said.\n\n“This kind of hate politics preys on the poor, taking advantage of their vulnerability while ignoring justice and accountability.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/ai-now-sounds-more-like-us-should-we-be-concerned","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"14:46:58+00:00","title":"AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, a wave of AI-powered deepfake voice scams targeted prominent Italian businessmen, with fraudsters impersonating Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request large financial transfers.

should we be concerned?\n\nSeveral wealthy Italian businessmen received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), caused by a technical error during an update to DynamoDB’s API that disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS), led to widespread failures across 113 AWS services.

AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nFrom banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms, the hours-long  breakdown  revealed how much of modern life depends on cloud’s infrastructure.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpz39jpj7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:12.550+00:00","title":"Life-changing eye implant helps blind patients read again","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A groundbreaking eye implant called the Prima, developed by California biotech Science Corporation and tested in a multinational trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, has enabled patients with geographic atrophy (GA)—a severe form of dry age-related macular degeneration—to regain central vision and read again.

It gives me such pleasure.\"\n\nThe technology offers hope to people with an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), called geographic atrophy (GA), which affects more than 250,000 people in the UK and five million worldwide.\n\nIn those with the condition - which is more common in older people - cells in a tiny area of the retina at the back of the eye gradually become damaged and die, resulting in blurred or distorted central vision. Colour and fine detail are often lost.\n\nThe new procedure involves inserting a tiny 2mm-square photovoltaic microchip, with the thickness of a human hair, under the retina.\n\nPatients then put on glasses with a built-in video camera. The camera sends an infrared beam of video images to the implant at the back of the eye, which sends them on to a small pocket processor to be enhanced and made clearer.\n\nThe images are then sent back to the patient's brain, via the implant and optic nerve, giving them some vision again.\n\nThe patients spent months learning how to interpret the images.\n\nMahi Muqit, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, who led the UK arm of the trial, told the BBC it was \"pioneering and life-changing technology\".\n\n\"This is the first implant that's been demonstrated to give patients meaningful vision that they can use in their daily life, such as reading, writing.\n\n\"I think this is a major advance,\" he said.\n\nFor the research, published in  the New England Journal of Medicine , 38 patients with geographic atrophy in five European countries took part in the trial of the Prima implant, which is made by California biotech Science Corporation.\n\nOf 32 patients given the implant, 27 were able to read again using their central vision. After a year, this equated to an improvement of 25 letters, or five lines, on an eye chart.\n\nFor Sheila, from Wiltshire, the improvement is even more dramatic. Without the implant, she is completely unable to read.\n\nBut when we filmed Sheila reading an eye chart at Moorfields Hospital, she did not make a single error. After completing it, she punched the air and cheered.\n\nThe task took huge concentration. Sheila had to put a pillow under her chin in order to steady the feed from the camera, which can focus on just one or two letters at a time. At some points she needed the device switched to magnification mode, especially to distinguish between the letters C and O.\n\nSheila began losing her central vision more than 30 years ago, due to loss of cells in the retina. She describes her vision as like having two black discs in each eye.\n\nSheila gets around using a white cane because her very limited peripheral vision is completely blurred. She is unable to read even the largest street signs when outdoors.\n\nWhen she had to give up her driving licence, she says she cried.\n\nBut after having an implant fitted around three years ago, she is delighted by her progress, as is the medical team at Moorfields.\n\n\"I am able to read my post, books, and do crosswords and Sudoku,\" she says.\n\nWhen asked if she ever thought she'd read again, Sheila replied: \"Not on your nelly!\"\n\n\"It is amazing. I am one happy bunny,\" she adds.\n\n\"Technology is moving so fast, it's amazing that I am part of it.\"\n\nSheila doesn't wear the device when outdoors. In part, this is because it requires great concentration - her head has to be held very still in order to read. She also does not want to become over-reliant on the device.\n\nInstead, she says she \"rushes her chores\" at home each day before sitting down and putting on the special glasses.\n\nThe Prima implant is not yet licensed so is not available outside of clinical trials, and it's unclear how much it may eventually cost.\n\nNonetheless, Mahi Muqit said he hoped it would be available to some NHS patients \"within a few years.\"\n\nIt's possible the technology could be used to help people with other eye conditions in the future.\n\nDr Peter Bloomfield, director of research at Macular Society, says the results are \"encouraging\" and \"fantastic news\" for those who currently have no treatment options.\n\n\"Artificial vision may offer a lot of hope to many, particularly after previous disappointments in the world of dry AMD treatment.\n\n\"We are now watching closely to see if the Prima implant will be approved for use here in the UK, and crucially whether it could be made available on the NHS.\"\n\nThe trials are not expected to help those with conditions where the optic nerve, which sends signals from the retina to the brain, is not functioning."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev1e7kw0d3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:21:10.570+00:00","title":"Catholic clergy sex abuse victims hopeful after Pope Leo meeting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Survivors of Catholic clergy sexual abuse, represented by ECA Global, have expressed hope after a historic meeting with Pope Leo at the Vatican, where they advocated for a global zero-tolerance policy that permanently removes abusive priests.

Pope Leo at the Vatican for the first time.\n\nGemma Hickey, board president of Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA Global), told the BBC it spoke \"volumes\" he had met them so soon in his papacy.\n\nThe group is pushing for a global zero-tolerance policy, already adopted in the US, of permanently removing a priest who admits or is proven to have sexually abused a child. The Pope acknowledged there was \"resistance in some parts of the world\" to this, Hickey said.\n\nThe new Pope, who assumed the role in May, has inherited the issue, which has haunted the Catholic Church for decades and the Vatican has struggled to root out.\n\nHis predecessor, Pope Francis, tried to address the problem by holding an unprecedented summit on paedophilia in the Church, and by changing its laws to explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, but problems remain.\n\nA  recent Vatican-commissioned report  was unusually critical of Church leaders, saying victims and survivors had frequently raised the lack of accountability of bishops and superiors. Many historic cases were allegedly covered up.\n\nECA Global also acknowledged pockets of resistance to a zero-tolerance policy, Hickey said. \"We were all being realistic when we recognised that there is resistance.\"\n\nFor Hickey, who uses they/them pronouns, the drive to see such a policy adopted worldwide is personal, as the Canadian said they were abused by a priest who was then shuffled between parishes.\n\nHickey said Monday's meeting was \"historic\" and \"a big step for all of us\".\n\n\"Hopefully this will set the tone for his papacy, because we want to work with him. We have the same goal, we want to end clergy abuse.\"\n\nSix board members and one other representative of ECA, a coalition of victims and advocates representing survivors from more than 30 countries, sat in a semi-circle in the Pope's Vatican office, with the pontiff at the head.\n\nDuring the meeting - which was scheduled for 20 minutes but lasted an hour - the Pope \"mostly listened to us\", Hickey said.\n\nThe Pope was \"quite empathetic\" hearing the story of a woman abused at a Catholic residential school for Indigenous children in Canada, and \"tender\" about Hickey's own experience, they added.\n\nThe first North American leader of the Catholic Church was \"very humble, funny, [and] very down to earth\", Hickey said.\n\n\"Survivors have long wanted a seat at the table and I didn't feel like he was giving us lip service. I felt like he was genuine, realistic, and very open and eager to collaborate with us.\"\n\nThe group is hoping a change of canon law will bring about the zero-tolerance policy worldwide, and has spoken to experts and compiled documents that they will give to Pope Leo.\n\n\"He seemed interested in looking at it,\" Hickey said.\n\nThe Vatican's child protection commission 100-page report emphasised the \"importance of a streamlined protocol for the resignation and/or removal of Church leaders or personnel in cases of abuse or negligence\".\n\nIt said victims and survivors stressed the \"urgent need for bishops and major superiors to be held accountable for negligence and cover-up was repeatedly stressed\".\n\nIt also relayed concerns about information not being provided to victims on how their reports of abuse were being handled, and said the public should know when a Church official had resigned or been removed due to abuse or negligence.\n\nHickey said they told the Pope at the start of the meeting: \"This is as much a risk for him to engage in a dialogue as it was for us.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, they were hopeful for change.\n\n\"We realise it's not something that's going to happen overnight, but at the end of the day, coming together and establishing a relationship and continuing to build that relationship is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nHickey said they told Pope Leo that \"just because it's a dark chapter, I feel like we can change how the story ends - he appreciated that\"."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c201k3wd65yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"23:45:12.059+00:00","title":"Prince Andrew dropping title is victory for Virginia Giuffre, co-author tells BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has voluntarily given up his royal titles, including the Duke of York and membership in the Order of the Garter, following allegations from Virginia Giuffre that he engaged in sexual relationships with her on multiple occasions, including one on Epstein's island during an alleged 'orgy'.

She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\" with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.\n\nPrince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, announced on Friday that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.\n\nBut there are still calls for them to be formally removed.\n\nMs Wallace said: \"I can speak for Virginia; I know that she would view it as a victory that he was forced, by whatever means, to voluntarily give them up.\"\n\nShe called it a \"symbolic gesture\" which has made \"modern history in terms of the royal era\", describing it as \"a step in the right direction\".\n\n\"Virginia wanted all the men who she had been trafficked to, against her will, to be held to account, and this is just one of the men.\n\n\"Even though he (Andrew) continues to deny it, his life is being eroded because of his past behaviour, as it should be,\" Ms Wallace said.\n\nMs Wallace went on to say there was a period when Prince Andrew \"indicated he was willing to help investigators in the US\" but he was \"never available, for some reason\".\n\n\"That's something he could still do.

flooding hit five states last week.\n\nThe National Civil Protection Coordination (CNPC) chief, Laura Velazquez Alzua, speaking during President Claudia Sheinbaum’s daily news briefing on Monday, said another 65 people were still missing.\n\nThe state of Veracruz on the country’s southeastern coastline has confirmed 29 deaths, followed by 21 in Hidalgo, 13 in Puebla and one in Queretaro, Alzua said.\n\nForty-three people are also reported missing in Hidalgo, along with 18 in Veracruz and four in Puebla.\n\nThousands of military troops have been deployed to offer assistance across the five affected states, and governors are also working together to coordinate support, Sheinbaum said.\n\nEarly estimates show that about 100,000 houses have been affected, she added, with some near rivers having “practically disappeared”.\n\nFacing questions about Mexico’s alert system, Sheinbaum said there were no meteorological signs “that could have indicated to us that the rain was going to be of this magnitude”.\n\nMeteorologists have said the rains occurred thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, which caused rivers to rapidly rise, leading to flooding and landslides.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall was reported on Wednesday in Veracruz’s city of Cerro Azul and Puebla’s Cuetzalan del Progreso, which saw 280mm and 286mm of rain, respectively, Alzua said.\n\nThe Mexican Army, Air Force and National Guard have jointly implemented response efforts, distributing food and clean water, sometimes by air, to locations otherwise made inaccessible by landslides and road closures.\n\nNearly 400 repair workers have restored more than 80 percent of the electricity supply across the five states, where about 263,000 users lost power, electricity

when are the awards announced?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes 2025 have officially kicked off with the first award for physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pgp3nx07o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"03:30:02.804+00:00","title":"Amazon services 'recovering' as Snapchat and banks among sites hit by outage","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A massive AWS outage on Monday, October 21, 2025, disrupted over 1,000 websites and apps, including Snapchat, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Fortnite, and Duolingo, affecting millions of users globally.

Services (AWS) said late Monday that it had resolved a massive outage that knocked some of the world's largest websites offline for much of the day.\n\nMore than 1,000 apps and websites - including social media platforms like Snapchat and banks such as Lloyds and Halifax - were impacted by problems that Amazon said were at the heart of the cloud computing giant's operations in the US.\n\nThe platform outage monitor Downdetector said user reports of problems globally soared to more than 11 million during the outage on Monday.\n\nEven after Amazon fixed the underlying problem, experts said the outage demonstrated the perils of having so many companies rely on a single, dominant provider.\n\n\"What this episode has highlighted is just how interdependent our infrastructure is,\" said Prof Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey.\n\n\"So many online services rely upon third parties for their physical infrastructure, and this shows that problems can occur in even the largest of those third-party providers.\n\n\"Small errors, often human made, can have widespread and significant impact.\"\n\nThe issues appear to have begun at around 07:00 BST on Monday, as users began to report problems accessing a slew of platforms.\n\nThis included a wide range of different sites and services, from massive online games like Fortnite to the language-learning app Duolingo.\n\nEarly in the day, Downdetector told the BBC it had seen more than four million reports from users across 500 sites within just a few hours - more than double the amount it would see across an entire regular

2025-10-20T09:15:07.348+00:00\n\nTitle: Cyber scams: Notorious hub linked to Chinese mafia raided in Myanmar\n\nThe Myanmar military says it has captured one of the most notorious scam compounds on the border with Thailand, as it reclaims key territory it lost in the ongoing civil war.\n\nKK Park, south of the border town of Myawaddy, has been synonymous with online fraud, money laundering and human trafficking for the past five years.\n\nThousands of people were lured to the compound with the promise of well-paid jobs, and then forced to run elaborate scams, stealing billions of dollars from victims all over the world.\n\nThe military, long tainted by its links to the scam business, now says it has taken the complex as it expands control around Myawaddy, the main trade link to Thailand.\n\nIn recent weeks the military, or junta, has pushed back insurgents in several parts of Myanmar, aiming to maximise the number of places where it can hold a planned election, starting in December.\n\nIt still doesn't control large swathes of the country, which has been torn apart by conflict since a military coup in February 2021. The election has been dismissed as a sham by opposition forces who have vowed to block it in areas they hold.\n\nKK Park began with a lease agreement in early 2020 to build an industrial park between the Karen National Union (KNU), the ethnic insurgent group which controls much of this region, and a little-known Hong Kong listed company, Huanya International.\n\nResearchers believe there are links between Huanya and a prominent Chinese underworld figure Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth, who has since invested in other scam centres on the border.\n\nThe complex expanded rapidly, and is easily visible from the Thai side of the border.\n\nThose who managed to escape from it describe a brutal regime imposed on the thousands of people, many from African countries, who were held there, forced to work long hours, with torture and beatings inflicted on those who failed to meet targets.\n\nA statement by the junta's information ministry said its forces had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers there and confiscating 30 of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite terminals – widely used by scam centres on the Thai-Myanmar border for online activities.\n\nThe statement blamed what it called the \"terrorist\" Karen National Union and volunteer people's defence forces, which have been fighting the junta since the coup, for illegally occupying the area.\n\nThe junta's claim to have shut down this infamous scam centre is almost certainly directed at its main patron, China. Beijing has been pressing the junta and the Thai government to do more to end the illegal businesses run by Chinese syndicates on their border.\n\nEarlier this year thousands of Chinese workers were taken out of scam compounds and flown on chartered planes back to China, after Thailand cut access to power and fuel supplies.\n\nBut KK Park is only one of at least 30 similar compounds located on the border. Most of these are under the protection of Karen militia groups allied to the junta, and most are still operating, with tens of thousands of people running scams inside them.\n\nIn fact, the support of these militia groups has been crucial in helping the military drive back the KNU and other resistance groups from territory they captured over the past two years.\n\nThe military now controls nearly all of the road linking Myawaddy to the rest of Myanmar, a goal the junta set itself before it holds the first stage of the election in December.\n\nIt has taken Lay Kay Kaw, a new town established for the KNU with Japanese funding in 2015, a time when there had been hopes for lasting peace in Karen State following a national ceasefire.\n\nThat is a more significant blow to the KNU than the takeover of KK Park, from which it did get some revenue, but where most of the financial benefits went to pro-junta militias.\n\nA well-placed source has told the BBC that scam work is continuing in KK Park, and that it is likely the military took control of only part of the sprawling complex.\n\nThe source also believes Beijing is giving the Myanmar military lists of Chinese individuals it wants taken from the scam compounds, and sent back to face trial in China, which may explain why KK Park was attacked."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2emdm84xjko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"23:02:14.774+00:00","title":"New Trump tariffs pose another hurdle for the housing market","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, timber, wooden furniture, steel, and copper are increasing construction and renovation costs, placing additional financial pressure on home buyers, builders, and furniture companies.

ago, he bought the last big items - couches - for his newly-built home in Hopatcong, New Jersey.\n\nMr Cabrera, who started working with a contractor in March to construct the three-bedroom house, was eager to get ahead of a fresh round of tariffs on key building materials and home items that  took effect earlier this week .\n\nMr Cabrera had already seen his initial budget of roughly $300,000 balloon to $450,000 as prices for a range of products, like cabinets from Asia, started going up since the spring.\n\nEarlier this week  new US tariffs  came in on items needed to renovate your home including imported kitchen cabinets, timber and wooden furniture.\n\n\"Tariffs were definitely on my mind throughout the whole process,\" said Mr Cabrera, who succeeded in finishing his build before the new tariffs, but still noticed rising prices in the run up.\n\n\"It was a concern every morning looking at prices, trying to figure out how to control the budget that kept increasing,\" he said.\n\nMr Cabrera's experience is one many home buyers, builders and renovators are grappling with.\n\nWhile the White House says the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing and protect national security, economists say they could intensify the US housing market's woes by adding to President Donald Trump's previous tariffs and slowing construction.\n\n\"We're in a fairly weak position in the housing market to begin with,\" said Peter Harrell, a visiting scholar at Georgetown Law School. \"The last thing an already not great new construction market needs is higher input costs.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is adding onto an industry that has already seen its share of tariff increases.\"\n\nOther levies Trump has imposed this year have included a 50% tariff on steel and a 50% tariff on copper imports, which have raised costs for building materials such as copper piping.\n\nThe levies are the latest in a slew of measures that economists warn could keep pushing up prices for people across the US.\n\nA recent report from Goldman Sachs found that US consumers will shoulder as much as 55% of the cost of Trump's tariffs this year. It takes time to raise prices on consumers, the economists noted, and US firms will increasingly pass on costs in the coming months.\n\nEven before the new tariffs took effect this week, furniture companies had been warning about a hit from tariffs. In April, the chief executive of RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, reacted with an expletive as he watched his company's stock tumble, in response to a major tariff announcement from the White House.\n\nRH in September said it will face $30 million in new tariffs costs in the second half of this year. The company also delayed the release of a design catalogue, citing uncertainty about pricing due to tariffs.\n\nAnd executives at the furniture retailer IKEA, which is known for being budget-friendly, warned this week that tariffs might force the company to raise prices. It imports most of the products it sells in the US.\n\nJean Lin, the founder of a design gallery for furniture and home decor, said she is less exposed to tariffs than some other businesses in her industry. Most of the furniture she sells, in partnership with independent designers, is made in the US.\n\nBut her Manhattan-based cooperative, called Colony, has still been feeling a pinch from tariffs since this spring. Homeowners and interior designers have scaled back purchases and projects because of tariff-related uncertainty, which has taken a toll on her sales.\n\n\"It's really hard to invest in anything when there's unknowns, especially works of great value or works that are going to go in your home for a long time,\" Ms Lin said.\n\nMaterial costs had also been rising, even before the latest round of tariffs. Ms Lin said one US-based mill worker, with whom she is collaborating for an interior design project, imports his materials - and those keep getting more expensive.\n\nThat could mean higher prices for consumers down the line.\n\n\"The next project he does, whether it's ours or somebody else's, he's going to quote accordingly,\" she said. \"If the construction fees are going up, if the material costs are going up, your architect and your interior designer fees are going to go up as well.\"\n\nAt Stillfried Design in lower Manhattan, prices for furniture made in Germany and Austria rose by nearly 15% this summer to account for broad-based tariffs on European imports and tariffs on steel.\n\nMichael Trubrig, who co-owns the business with his wife, said: \"We had to raise prices because we couldn't lower the margin\". He does not expect the new furniture tariffs to affect him, because of a trade agreement capping tariffs on the European Union at 15%.\n\nBut the broader tariff landscape continues to present a hurdle.\n\n\"It's not business-ending, but it's not healthy, either,\" Mr Trubrig said.\n\nHigh mortgage rates have weighed on new home sales in recent years.\n\nThe new tariffs on imported timber, lumber, kitchen cabinets and furniture \"will create additional headwinds for an already challenged housing market by further raising construction and renovation costs,\" Buddy Hughes, chairman for the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.\n\nAffordable housing construction could be hit particularly hard, said Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. She said that as material costs rise, the cost of new housing development will increase, too, which could in turn prompt developers to rethink low-margin affordable housing projects.\n\nMatthew Walsh, a housing economist at Moody's Analytics, said that cost uncertainty will be the most immediate effect of this week's home building tariffs, especially since the levies are poised to ramp up again in January.\n\nSome economists say the furniture and lumber tariffs, on their own, are unlikely to spell disaster for builders and single-handedly tank the home building market.\n\n\"It's not a catastrophe for home builders ,\" said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com. \"It's yet another unwelcome thing that they have to deal with now.\"\n\nBut, he noted, \"these things do add up.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kqve398vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:54:18.719+00:00","title":"Europe 'ready to deploy' troops to Ukraine if ceasefire secured, says Healey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed that European troops are ready to deploy to Ukraine within weeks if a ceasefire is reached between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

to Ukraine if ceasefire secured, says Healey\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey has said European troops are \"ready to deploy\" to Ukraine in the coming weeks if Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agree on a ceasefire.\n\nAfter a surprise call last Thursday, the US and Russian presidents are planning to meet in Budapest, Hungary. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been invited but  said he is ready to join.\n\nAsked if troops could deploy if a deal was reached in the next two weeks, Healey said: \"If President Trump can broker a peace, then we will be ready to help secure that peace\".\n\nBut he added that Ukrainians must be the \"people who will decide how and what\" is negotiated in any peace talks.\n\nMembers of the \"coalition of the willing\", an alliance of 26 European nations founded in March by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to guarantee Ukraine's security, had been \"developing detailed plans, in the event of a ceasefire\", Healey said.\n\nUnder the plans, UK troops could join a multinational force to secure Ukraine's border.\n\nThe work of \"over 200 military planners from 38-plus nations over the last six months\" had meant forces were ready to deploy when needed, Healey said.\n\nThe government were expecting to spend \"well over\" £100m on sending troops to Ukraine, with some funds already used to prepare the deployment, Healey said.\n\nSpeaking at the London Lord Mayor's Annual Defence Lecture, Healey also said Vladimir Putin views Britain as his \"number one enemy\" because of the country's support for Ukraine.\n\nThe defence secretary also warned of a \"new era of threat\" and said the risk of wider conflict in Europe has not been as great since the end of World War Two.\n\nDuring the speech, Healey also announced British soldiers will be  granted new powers to shoot down drones  threatening military bases.\n\nFour British airbases used by US forces reported mystery drone sightings last year, while drones have disrupted airspace across Europe a number of times in recent months.\n\nThe new powers will only apply to military sites, but could be extended to civilian locations such as airports.\n\nHealey said the introduction of a \"kinetic option\" would enable British troops or Ministry of Defence (MoD) police to shoot drones posing a threat to a military site in the UK.\n\nThe announcement followed reports that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky ended in a \"shouting match\", as US officials pushed Ukraine to give up land to Russia.\n\nZelensky had gone to Washington to  ask the US to supply sought-after Tomahawk  cruise missiles to Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory.\n\nBut reports suggest Trump had instead insisted Zelensky surrender the entire eastern Donbas region to Putin. Russia controls 70% of Donetsk and nearly all of neighbouring Luhansk.\n\nThe  Financial Times reported  Trump had warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar with the conversation.\n\nIn the more than 1,300 days since Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin has become increasingly reliant on support from North Korea, Iran and China.\n\nAccording to Healey, Russia has suffered over a million casualties and devoted 40% of its government spending to the military.\n\nBut in recent months Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, prompting emergency power cuts across the country.\n\nEuropean leaders have expressed concern over Trump's shifting stance, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warning on social media that \"appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace\".\n\nFinnish President Alexander Stubb said \"the only ones who can decide on the land issue are the Ukrainians themselves\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC , Stubb said Finland, a member of the coalition of the willing.  would never recognise Crimea, or the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk, as Russian.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter  to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4nr1415wo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:06:29.939+00:00","title":"What does Kevin Federline's upcoming book say about Britney Spears?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Federline, the former husband of pop star Britney Spears, has released a memoir titled 'You Thought You Knew,' in which he alleges that Spears exhibited erratic behavior as a mother and wife, including drinking during pregnancy and using cocaine while breastfeeding.

relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.\n\nKevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.\n\nSpears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.\n\nFederline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin.\n\nHe accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.\n\nWhen they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"\n\nFederline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"\n\nHe writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years. Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".\n\nThe pair got together in the summer of 2004, after Spears's commercial peak.\n\nThey married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.\n\nSpears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.\n\nThe couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.\n\nIn the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.\n\nShe made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.\n\nThose public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.\n\nSpears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.\n\nSpears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.\n\nIn that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".\n\nSpears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".\n\nIn a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.\n\nWhile the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.\n\nFederline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it.\n\n\"I picked it up and put it down quite a lot over probably a five-year period,\" he told the Associated Press. \"I think that it's a very good description of me, who I am, the father I've become, the husband I am, the ex-husband I am.\"\n\nHe also told AP: \"I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxzdg203jo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:34:44.125+00:00","title":"The trailblazer who made history as NASA's first woman commander","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eileen Collins made history as NASA’s first woman to pilot and command a space shuttle, breaking gender barriers in spaceflight.

And kept on going.\n\nEileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name.\n\nNow a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that.\n\nWe meet Collins at London's Science Museum. She's softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel.\n\n\"I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do,\" she says.\n\n\"Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I'll be a lady astronaut.\"\n\nBut that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft.\n\nAnd the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot.\n\nIn the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa's reusable \"space planes\".\n\nShe knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995.\n\n\"As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,\" she says.\n\n\"And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: 'Hey, they're really good'.\"\n\nShe was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another space first.\n\nCollins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both.\n\nBut Collins says being a mum and a commander were \"the two best jobs in the world\".\n\n\"But I'm going to tell you it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander,\" she laughs.\n\n\"The best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent - because you have to learn how to say no to people.\"\n\nNasa's Space Shuttles, which flew for three decades, reached breathtaking highs, but also some terrible lows.\n\nIn 1986, the Challenger spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure seconds after launching, killing all seven crew members on board.\n\nAnd in 2003, the Columbia shuttle broke up in the skies over Texas at the end of its mission, killing its crew of seven as well.\n\nA piece of insulating foam on Columbia's fuel tank broke loose during launch, damaging the heat shield with devastating results.\n\nColumbia was unable to withstand the fiery re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating as the world watched on in horror.\n\nCollins shakes her head at the memory of the disaster, and of the friends whose lives were lost.\n\nBut with her job as commander, she had to pick up the mantle - she was to be in charge of the shuttle's following flight.\n\nDid she think about quitting at that point?\n\n\"People throughout the shuttle programme were counting on the commander to stick with it,\" she says quietly.\n\n\"I think quitting the mission would have been the opposite of brave… and I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people.\"\n\nBut when her mission finally took to the skies in 2005, the nightmare scenario happened again. A chunk of foam broke away during launch.\n\nThis time, though, there was a plan in place to check the damage. But it meant undertaking one of the riskiest maneuvers in space history.\n\nCollins had to pilot the shuttle through a 360 degree flip while flying beneath the International Space Station. It allowed colleagues on the orbiting lab to photograph the craft's underside and check if the heatshield had been breached.\n\n\"There were engineers and managers saying it couldn't be done, all these reasons why it was too dangerous,\" she says.\n\n\"I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander, and I said: 'It sounds like we can do it'.\"\n\nWith her hands steady at the controls, her voice calm as she spoke to mission control, Collins piloted the craft through a slow, graceful somersault. With the shuttle's underside now visible, the damage was quickly spotted - and a spacewalk was carried out to repair it.\n\nIt meant Collins and her crew would make it safely home.\n\nThis was Collins's last flight. She tells us that she always planned to stop after her fourth mission - to give others a chance to go to space.\n\nAnd she's watched plenty of astronauts follow in her footsteps. Does she have any advice for the next generation dreaming of the stars?\n\n\"Do your homework, listen to your teacher, pay attention in class and read books, and that will give you something to focus on,\" she says in a matter-of-fact way.\n\nThose who follow Collins to space will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander.\n\nShe says she has no regrets about bringing her astronaut career to an end. She made her decision and didn't look back. But there's still a wistful look in her eye when we ask if she'd be tempted if a seat on a spacecraft became free.\n\n\"Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday. When I'm an old lady, maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09eklpe24o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:53:04.607+00:00","title":"The two words you need to help you push back at work","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article emphasizes the importance of setting clear boundaries at work to prevent burnout, with experts like Helen Tupper, Dr. Claire Ashley, and Dr. Richard Duggins advocating for practical strategies such as replacing 'I can't' with 'I don't' to reinforce limits.

2025-10-19T23:53:04.607+00:00\n\nTitle: The two words you need to help you push back at work\n\nSaying \"no\" to a boss can feel impossible.\n\nWhatever our job, we all want to impress rather than disappoint.\n\nBut ambition can be a very slippery slope. Before you know it, work is coming home with you - seeping into weekends and disrupting time with family and friends.\n\nExperts agree learning to set boundaries is the way to stem the flow.\n\nCareer coach Helen Tupper, co-founder of Squiggly Careers, suggests a simple language shift can help reinforce boundaries.\n\nShe recommends replacing \"I can't\" with \"I don't\".\n\n\"I can't\" invites negotiation - people might try to convince you that you actually can,\" she says.\n\nBut \"I don't\" is more definitive and harder to challenge.\n\nFor example you can say \"I don't go to meetings after 5pm on a Wednesday because I pick my kids up then,\" she suggests.\n\nModel and TV chef Lorraine Pascale says not doing this ultimately led to her burning out.\n\nAlongside her television career, she opened a patisserie in Covent Garden and published a series of cookbooks, all whilst raising her daughter.\n\n\"I just wasn't very good at saying no.\n\n\"You don't want to upset people, everyone's feeding stuff in your ear as to what you should be doing. So you just keep going,\" she told  The Woman's Hour Guide to Life.\n\nShe adds that her perfectionism, including personally approving every recipe in her books, didn't help.\n\nFor Lorraine, burnout manifested physically and mentally - including \"not wanting to go near\" cakes.\n\n\"It was like an all-body reaction - a tightness in my chest,\" she explains. \"I was having arguments with myself. A lot of self-blame, a lot of guilt, and a lot of tiredness.\"\n\nLorraine's experience shows burnout can affect anyone at any level, even if statistics suggest it is more likely to happen to women - in part because of added family responsibilities.\n\nDr Claire Ashley, author of The Burnout Doctor - written after experiencing it herself - says on a practical front, sticking to a firm routine over when you finish work each day allows our brains to complete the \"stress cycle\" and enjoy time off.\n\nBut the real solution is adjusting your goals to your \"current capacity\".\n\n\"Ask yourself whether what you want to achieve is reasonable given your mental and emotional resources at the time,\" she says.\n\nIn Lorraine's case this involved stepping back from cooking and going to therapy. This helped her understand that the toxic elements of her drive to impress stemmed from her childhood in foster care.\n\nShe's since begun studying psychology herself and says she is \"much better\" - gradually getting back into cooking on more \"intentional\" terms.\n\nOf course, stress and long hours are part of any job.\n\nBut stats show an increase in the number of workers reaching breaking point.\n\nNine out of 10 workers have experienced high or extreme levels of pressure or stress in the past year,  research suggests .\n\nFeeling stressed or burnt out isn't the same as having  clinical burnout  - even if we often use the term loosely.\n\nDr Ashley says exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance are the three defining symptoms.\n\nUnless we meet all these, we don't yet have diagnosable burnout. But of course this doesn't mean we're not on the way.\n\nTupper says it's important to stop, celebrate and acknowledge your own successes, not just focus on the next thing.\n\nDoing our best to avoid comparisons with colleagues can also help, so we run our own race, Tupper adds.\n\nOf course, not everyone is in a position to push back at work - especially in corporate, or hierarchical job environments.\n\nDr Richard Duggins, an NHS psychiatrist and the author of Burnout-Free Working, often helps patients who feel they can't assert boundaries.\n\nHe encourages workers to talk to their boss regardless of how junior they are.\n\n\"Most employers, even the hard-nosed ones, will listen and make adjustments when they understand that preventing burnout benefits everyone.\"\n\nHe says setting boundaries, asking for help, or adjusting workload or flexibility can all help, but in the end if the workplace environment doesn't change then we need to make changes to protect ourselves.\n\nAppreciating our life stages can be help with this, notes Dr Ashley.\n\n\"It's okay to say that someone working part-time, or with family responsibilities, may not be able to match the workload of a younger colleague.\"\n\nAs Lorraine puts it: \"Ambitious is fine. Being ambitious is a beautiful thing, but just learn to say no more often.\"\n\nSign up here  to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7ekl4yl8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"23:42:05.680+00:00","title":"Cate Blanchett: In praise of the humble seed","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cate Blanchett, a globally acclaimed Hollywood actress, has taken a passionate interest in environmental conservation by becoming an ambassador for the Kew Gardens Millennium Seed Bank (MSB), which celebrates its 25th anniversary.

humble seed\n\nShe's a Hollywood A-lister, with a mantelpiece groaning under the weight of awards. But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed.\n\nHer eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.\n\n\"It's quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,\" she tells us.\n\n\"It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they're not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.\"\n\nWe meet her at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.\n\n\"Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,\" she says.\n\n\"And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here… and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring.\"\n\nThe MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world.\n\nThe seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.\n\nThe conservation project was opened by The King  - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He's taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett.\n\nIn the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost.\n\n\"I know  how  absolutely  critical  it all is, and  the  destruction  of  rainforests,  the  extinction  of  endless  species,  which  have  very  likely  remarkable  properties,\" he tells the podcast.\n\nWhen the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction.\n\nBut 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.\n\n\"We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,\" explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who's been showing Cate Blanchett the team's work.\n\n\"We're just providing a safe space for them until we can get them back out into a habitat where they can thrive and survive.\"\n\nThis includes projects like one taking place on the South Downs. A special mix of seeds from the MSB are being sown to help restore the rare chalk grasslands there.\n\nAnd this restoration work is being repeated around the world.\n\n\"We've been to every kind of habitat, from sea level to about 5,000m, and from pole to pole - literally,\" explained Dr Breman.\n\n\"And we're involved in restoring tropical forest, dry deciduous forest, grassland, steppe - you name it - we're trying to help people put those plants back in place.\"\n\nThe seed bank also helped to restore plants after intense wildfires swept across Australia in 2019. Cate Blanchett says this meant a lot to her.\n\n\"There are almost 9,000 species of Australian plant that are stored [at the MSB].  And we know that bushfires are getting increasingly more intense. And it's sad to say - but knowing that insurance policy exists, is of great solace to me.\"\n\nWorking as an ambassador for Wakehurst has meant that the actor has had a chance to get hands on with the seeds.\n\n\"Have I got dirt under my fingernails? Well, I'm trying to turn my brown thumbs green,\" she laughs.\n\n\"You know, living in Sussex, you can't not but become a passionate gardener. So I've had a lot of questions about how one stores seeds as a lay person, and I've learned a lot about that. My seed management has definitely, definitely improved.\"\n\nAnd after spending so much time with the researchers at the MSB, is she at all tempted to swap the film set for the lab?\n\n\"I wish I had the skill - maybe I could play a scientist,\" she laughs.\n\nCate Blanchett describes the seed bank as the UK's best kept secret - and believes that over the next 25 years its work will continue to grow in importance.\n\n\"You often think, where are the good news stories? And we're actually sitting inside one,\" she tells us.\n\n\"You come here, you visit the seed bank, you walk through such a biodiverse landscape, and you leave uplifted. You know change is possible and it's happening.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev1en9077ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:33:00.299+00:00","title":"What has caused AWS outage today - and why did it make the internet fall apart?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An AWS DNS error at its northern Virginia data center caused widespread outages affecting major platforms including Snapchat, Reddit, Roblox, Fortnite, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and government services such as HMRC.

has caused AWS outage today - and why did it make the internet fall apart?\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has had a bad day.\n\nThat's how the boss of another big US tech firm Cloudflare put it – probably feeling very relieved that today's outage, hitting over 1,000 companies and affecting millions of internet users, had nothing to do with him.\n\nThe places hit by the outage vary significantly. It took out major social media platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and games like Roblox and Fortnite.\n\nAWS is a US giant with a large global footprint, having positioned itself as the backbone of the internet.\n\nIt provides tools and computers which enable around a third of the internet to work, it offers storage space and database management, it saves firms from having to maintain their own costly set-ups, and it also connects traffic to those platforms.\n\nThat's how it sells its services: let us look after your business's computing needs for you.\n\nBut today something very mundane went very wrong: a common kind of outage known as a Domain Name System (DNS) error.\n\nPeople who work in the tech industry will be rolling their eyes right now.\n\nThis common error can cause a lot of havoc.\n\n\"It's always DNS!\" is something I hear a lot.\n\nWhen someone taps an app or clicks a link, their device is essentially sending a request to be connected to that service.\n\nDNS is supposed to act like a map, and today AWS lost its bearings – platforms like Snapchat, Canva and HMRC were all still there but it couldn't see where they were to direct traffic to them.\n\nThese errors happen for a number of reasons.\n\nUsually it's a maintenance issue or a server failure. Sometimes that's human error, someone misconfiguring something somewhere, or in extreme cases a cyber attack - although there's no evidence of this so far.\n\nAWS said it occurred at its vast data centre plant in northern Virginia, its oldest and biggest site.\n\nA chorus of experts have said today is a textbook illustration of the risks of putting all of your eggs in one basket in terms of a service provider - AWS is a giant and millions of businesses rely on it.\n\nAnd they are right, but the issue is there aren't many alternatives at the sheer scale provided by AWS.\n\nThere are only two main contenders in fact, and they're both other US giants: Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform.\n\nSmaller rivals include IBM and the Chinese firm Alibaba. The parent company of the supermarket Lidl launched a European rival called Stackit last year, in direct competition with Amazon.\n\nBut AWS remains the dominant player by some margin.\n\nSome argue the UK and Europe urgently needs to build up its own infrastructure and be less reliant on the US for cloud services – while others say it's too late.\n\nSomeone working in government once told me an MP informally proposed creating a UK version of AWS.\n\n\"But what's the point?\" came the reply. \"We already have AWS, over there.\"\n\nPerhaps incidents like today's highlight why it's not quite that simple.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it - and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said in July. \"It's my favourite. It's my favourite place. I love it.\"\n\nTrump announced the construction in a social media post, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space.\n\n\"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc,\" he wrote.\n\nHe said the project is being privately funded by \"many generous Patriots\". Their identities are unclear still as the White House has not released any names of who might be funding it.\n\nThe White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.\n\nFrom the south side of the building, the BBC saw several large pieces of construction equipment - some adorned with US flags - near the East Wing.\n\nTrump wrote in his post that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, though it is attached to the main structure.\n\nThe covered entryway, which spans much of the East Wing's south side, appeared as though it was being gutted, with concrete debris and metal cables clearly visible from several hundred metres.\n\nThough the White House and its adjoining parks are administered by the National Park Service (NPS), the president generally has broad powers to make renovations.\n\nRobert K Sutton, former chief historian of the NPS, told the BBC that there is always public concern when the White House goes under construction.\n\n\"There has been controversy with anything going on related to the White House pretty much since it was built,\" he said.\n\nThe NPS has guidelines and a rigorous review process for any construction.  That includes things like reviewing in-depth plans for a project, vetting the architect and designs and reviewing the costs.\n\nThat – he said – hasn't been done here.\n\n\"This building is so important. It's considered, I think, to be the most important executive building in the world – yet we just don't know what's happening and I think that's very inappropriate.\"\n\nMr Sutton noted that figures for how many people the new ballroom can host have been tossed around, ranging from 600 to more than 900.\n\nThe White House has released some information on the project, including drawings that give a sense of its scale and a new interior that includes seating for hundreds and decadent gold chandeliers.\n\nIt said that construction would begin in September and Trump had met with those at the National Parks Service and the US Secret Service, among others, about the project.\n\nThe Trump administration said it selected Clark Construction to head the project, with McCrery Architects designing it. The White House has said the Secret Service \"will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications\" to the building.\n\n\"I am honored that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People's House, while preserving the elegance of its classical design and historical importance,\" McCrery Architects head Jim McCrery said.\n\nSutton said an extensive review process is typically in place for projects like this to ensure there is functionality to any changes, and that the White House sticks to its iconic appearance - noting these changes will outlive presidents and generations.\n\nHe said he worried that this process is being rushed and will be a reflection of Trump and his signature style instead of the country's history.\n\n\"It's always been called the People's House,\" he said.\n\nTrump has installed a number of changes at the White House this year, including re-decorating the Oval Office with a variety of gold decor and paving over the grass in the Rose Garden with concrete to add tables and chairs.\n\nThe new White House renovation project has also been criticised by the Society of Architectural Historians, an international non-profit group that studies the preservation of historic buildings worldwide.\n\nIn a statement last week, the group said it \"expresses great concern over the proposed ballroom additions\", which it notes, \"will be the first major change to its exterior appearance in the last 83 years (since the East Wing in its current form was built in 1942).\n\n\"Therefore, such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process.\"\n\nThe American Institute of Architects has also expressed alarm, and called for a transparent review of the project.\n\nBut Trump is certainly not the first president to leave his mark on the building.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who preceded Trump, had the White House tennis court converted to be able to also host basketball games.\n\nThe  White House swimming pool  was converted to the White House Press Room during Richard Nixon's presidency. Briefings now still regularly take place in the room where presidents once swam laps.\n\nThe indoor pool had originally been installed in 1933 for President Franklin D Roosevelt, who swam regularly for exercise due to a polio diagnosis more than a decade earlier.\n\nAfter it closed, Gerald Ford had an outdoor pool installed in 1975.\n\nBefore that, one of the biggest renovations came under Harry Truman, who saw the complete gutting and rebuilding of the White House from 1948 to 1952. Truman was relocated from living at the White House during the extensive project."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20p0qx50no","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:18:07.378+00:00","title":"Palestinian woman in hospital after being clubbed by masked Israeli settler","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 55-year-old Palestinian woman, Umm Saleh Abu Alia, was attacked and hospitalized after being clubbed by a masked Jewish settler in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya during the olive harvest season.

to hospital after being clubbed over the head by a masked Jewish settler as she was picking olives.\n\nThe unprovoked attack, which took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank, was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.\n\nMr Nathaniel said the settler knocked the woman unconscious with the first strike of his stick, before hitting her again as she lay on the ground. She has been named locally as Umm Saleh Abu Alia.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC the confrontation was dispersed after its forces arrived, and that it \"strongly condemns any form of violence\" by settlers.\n\nHowever, Mr Nathaniel said Israeli soldiers were on-site prior to the attack and had \"lured\" him and others into an \"ambush\". He said soldiers \"sped off\" just before the settlers launched the assault. The BBC has put this specific allegation to the IDF.\n\nAt least 80% of residents of Turmus Ayya hold US citizenship or residency, according to Israeli media. The US State Department did not respond to specific questions about the incident but told the BBC it has \"no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens\".\n\nThe young male attacker is seen in the footage wielding a large wooden stick with a knot at one end, reminiscent of a club, before he swings it overhead and strikes Mrs Abu Alia.\n\n\"It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,\" Mr Nathaniel told the BBC.\n\n\"He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.\"\n\nThe mother of five is then seen bleeding as she is carried into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. She was initially admitted to an intensive care unit but is now in a stable condition, doctors say.\n\nHer cousin, Hamdi Abu Alia, told the BBC that medical staff found she had been struck twice in the head. Amin Abu Alia, the mayor of the adjacent village al-Mughayyir, confirmed details of the attack to the BBC.\n\nThe attack was part of a wider incident in which at least 15 masked settlers were seen hurling stones and attacking other Palestinians who were harvesting olives - as well as activists who had arrived to support them, including Mr Nathaniel.\n\nAt least one car was torched. Others had their windows smashed.\n\nIt is one of a spate of attacks in recent weeks linked to the olive harvest, which officially began on 9 October.\n\nThe harvest is an age-old ritual that forms a major part of Palestinian culture. It is also an economic necessity for many, but is increasingly precarious.\n\nFarmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks during harvest season, including organised assaults and the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.\n\nOf the 71 settler attacks documented by the UN's humanitarian office, Ocha, across the West Bank between 7 and 13 October, half were related to the ongoing harvest season. The attacks affected Palestinians in 27 villages.\n\nIn 2025, more than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in settler attacks across the West Bank, according to Ocha.\n\nAttacks are intended, monitors say, to intimidate Palestinians and eventually drive them from their land so settlers can seize it. The vast majority go unpunished, with just 3% of official investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2023 ending in a conviction, according to Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din.

as Andrew questions continue\n\nKing Charles wants to focus on \"duty and service\" and hopes people will not be distracted by \"other matters\", his spokesperson has said.\n\nIt is understood to be a reference to his brother Prince Andrew, who is facing fresh allegations about Virginia Giuffre, whose memoir is being  posthumously published this week.\n\nThe comments come after the King met those affected by the synagogue attack in Manchester.\n\nPrince Andrew announced last week he will be giving up his royal titles, but the scrutiny over his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continues.\n\nSpeaking after the King's Manchester visit, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"This is the King continuing with duty and service in his longstanding mission to bring communities together particularly in times of challenge.\n\n\"And he hopes very much that the focus will be on the community impacted rather than any other matters.\"\n\nEarlier, a royal source said they were expecting \"more days of pain ahead\".\n\nRoyal sources also said the claims about Prince Andrew and his links to sex offender Epstein are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent\".\n\nOn Friday the prince announced that he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York. But there are still calls for them to be formally removed.\n\nRachael Maskell, who is the MP for York and says many of her constituents no longer want the city to be associated with the royal, wants the government to change the law to allow this process.\n\nMeanwhile the Metropolitan Police are looking into claims the prince asked a protection officer for personal  information about Virginia Giuffre , who said she had been forced to have sex with the prince, a claim he has consistently denied.\n\nHer memoir, published posthumously this week, adds to the pressure on him.\n\nEarlier, a royal source had said they were expecting \"more days of pain ahead\" in the scandal.\n\nThe source said the focus of the Royal Family's thoughts were on Epstein's victims and the \"whole network of girls and young women who were abused and treated appallingly\".\n\nIt should not be seen as a reputational or PR battle, they suggested, saying they were treating the ongoing claims with \" very great concern\".\n\nThe  posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre  repeats claims she was trafficked for sex by Epstein to his powerful circle of friends, including Prince Andrew - an allegation that the prince has strongly denied.\n\nOn Friday the prince announced he would no longer use his titles and honours, which include the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. He also  gave up his membership of the prestigious Order of the Garter.\n\nHe remains a prince, a title assigned from birth as the son of a monarch. But constitutional expert Craig Prescott says Andrew's title of \"prince\" could also be theoretically removed by a legal document issued by monarchs, called Letters Patent. If he ceased to be a prince and as he is no longer Duke of York, he would become Andrew Windsor.\n\nAndrew could also be expelled from his place in the line of succession to the throne, where he is currently eighth in line. Parliament could remove him, according to the House of Commons Library, but it would require the consent of all the Commonwealth countries which has the King as head of state.\n\nRemoving his other titles could also be carried out by legislation in Parliament.\n\nAlthough Palace pressure might have been exerted, the handing back of his titles was a voluntary move. They were not taken away, but Andrew's offer to stop using them can be enacted immediately and avoids using parliamentary time that would be necessary to remove those titles.\n\nBut Maskell wants the government to amend current laws to make it possible for the King to directly take away his other titles and honours - and she says a poll in her York Central constituency showed overwhelming support for forcing Andrew to lose his titles.\n\n\"There are opportunities here to address the wrongs of history and ensure the voices of victims and survivors are heard and acted upon,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nMaskell, who lost the Labour whip in a rebellion over welfare reforms, said she \"didn't come into Parliament to discuss princes and princesses\" but that such a change could be quickly passed allowing the monarch to remove titles and honours.\n\n\"It's a simple single clause, it could be added to constitutional bill or a private member's bill,\" she said.\n\nFlynn, the SNP's Westminster leader, has also called for a better mechanism to remove titles.\n\nHe said the public was \"angry and aghast and they deserve to know that some MPs share their outrage\".\n\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson,  speaking on BBC Breakfast, said that with regards the debate about taking away the prince's titles: \"Any further decisions are not something we as a government would be involved in.\"\n\nPrince Andrew also faces pressure from inquiries in the US into Epstein's contacts with influential people, with more documents being trawled.\n\nAt the weekend, there were reports of emails showing Epstein's connections with Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also lost her title and is no longer the Duchess of York.\n\nThe emails suggested that Prince Andrew in 2011 had sought personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre from his police protection officers and that he had already had her social security number.\n\nThis was in contrast to his claims in his BBC Newsnight interview - when he said: \"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it is actively looking into the claims about Andrew seeking information about her.\n\nThe documents emerging from the US, published by the Mail on Sunday, also showed Epstein claiming to have financially supported Sarah Ferguson for 15 years.\n\nSources close to Sarah Ferguson denied that this was correct.\n\nThe announcement that Prince Andrew would lose his remaining titles had been intended to draw a line under what a royal source had called the \"constant parade of headlines\" about him, which had taken attention away from other royals.\n\nRoyal sources highlighted that also included the work by Queen Camilla and the Duchess of Edinburgh to challenge violence against women.\n\nThe Palace will not want the scandal surrounding Andrew to overshadow a historic state visit to the Vatican this week, during which King Charles will meet Pope Leo.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

control?\n\nJudging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.\n\nIts masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.\n\nOther victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.\n\nSome of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.\n\nThis is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.\n\nFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.\n\nOn his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\n\n\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nThree days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"\n\nSo, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas?\n\nAnd ultimately,  after two years of war  that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?\n\nFor many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry -  this ugly endgame  is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.\n\nOf the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control.\n\nAnd indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.\n\n\"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\n\n\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"\n\nDr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\n\n\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.\n\n\"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others.\n\n\"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"\n\nOther Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.\n\nMoumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them.\n\nHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\n\n\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\n\n\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.\n\n\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas.\n\n\"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"\n\nMr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.\n\nThe disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\n\n\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\n\n\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"\n\nHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza.  The Trump ceasefire plan,  to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".\n\nBut even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.\n\nTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.\n\nFrom its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.\n\nInitially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\n\n\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"\n\nBut when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.\n\nA violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election,  in sole control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nEighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.\n\nDespite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\n\n\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"\n\nWith Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\n\n\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"\n\nThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.\n\nMr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.\n\nNetanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.\n\nAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.\n\nTunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit.\n\nHe was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.\n\nOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.\n\nRegional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.\n\nHamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling  in places like Lebanon  and Iraq.\n\nIran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.\n\nIn 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.\n\nSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.\n\nA local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).\n\nPrecise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.\n\nPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening.\n\nLocal residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.\n\nWhat began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.\n\nIt emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.\n\nAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.\n\nEli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity.\n\n\"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"\n\nBy the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).\n\nHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.\n\nEventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\n\n\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.\n\nAnd the job is far from done.\n\n\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\n\n\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"\n\nRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.\n\nIsrael has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures.\n\nFrom its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.\n\nIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024.\n\nThree months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.\n\nDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.\n\nBut Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.\n\nEzzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.\n\nOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.\n\nAll are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.\n\nDespite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war.\n\nWithout mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.\n\n\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says.\n\n\"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"\n\nHamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\n\n\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life.\n\n\"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"\n\nDr Milshtein is doubtful.\n\n\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.\n\nDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.\n\nBut Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\n\n\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says.\n\n\"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"\n\nFor now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.\n\nBut Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

2025-10-21T00:53:52.772+00:00\n\nTitle: Friendly Albanese-Trump meeting masks Australia's creeping doubts about US\n\nFrom the White House on Monday, US President Donald Trump waxed lyrical about his country's friendship with Australia.\n\n\"We've been long-term, longtime allies and I would say there's never been anybody better,\" Trump told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, at  the pair's first official meeting .\n\n\"We fought wars together and we never had any doubts,\" he said.\n\nAustralia though, for arguably the first time in its history, is feeling some creep in.\n\nThe US has historically been seen as its best friend, the ultimate ally.\n\nBefore Albanese hopped on his flight to Washington for the meeting - which he's been desperately trying to organise for months - he said it was an important opportunity to \"consolidate and strengthen\" the connection.\n\n\"Australia and the United States have stood shoulder-to-shoulder in every major conflict for over a century,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBut in a world order which challenges Washington's dominance, and under an administration which is stretching many of its ties, Australia is casting a more critical eye on the relationship.\n\n\"The Trump administration is clearly fraying some of those long-held, unexamined beliefs about the reliability of the United States as an ally,\" Sam Roggeveen, from Australia's Lowy Institute think tank, told the BBC.\n\nTrump's first term was a challenge for Australia – and few here expected his second would be much different. An election campaign earlier this year was in many ways hijacked by the question of how each prospective prime minister would deal with the president.\n\nTrump has frustrated Australia with his sweeping tariffs scheme, imposing an import tax of 10% on most of its goods - 50% for aluminium and steel - something seen as a breach of a decades-long free trade agreement.\n\n\"This is not the act of a friend,\" Albanese said at the time.\n\nThen came a review of the landmark Aukus defence pact, announced in June to jolts of panic in Canberra.\n\nOutwardly, the Albanese government didn't waver in professing its confidence that the agreement - which will give Australia cutting-edge nuclear submarine technology in exchange for help countering China in the Asia-Pacific - would go ahead. It is natural for a new government to review their predecessor's decisions, it said.\n\nBut the White House's isolationist rhetoric - along with the fact that the US is facing challenges in its own submarine supply - made some nervous that the deal may be cancelled or rewritten, threatening to leave Australia vulnerable with trouble brewing on its doorstep.\n\nAnd then there was Albanese's long battle to secure a meeting with Trump – interpreted by parts of the Australian parliament and the country's media as a snub.\n\nAn awkward encounter between Defence Minister Richard Marles and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth earlier this year didn't help. Marles had met Hegseth in August to lobby him on Aukus, but the latter's office issued - and later retracted - a statement saying there were no talks, only \"a happenstance encounter\".\n\nUltimately the meeting on Monday went as well as it possibly could have for Albanese.\n\nHe leaves the White House with both Trump's praise and a deal promising US investment in developing  Australia's critical minerals industry , which is hoped will help the nation break China's near monopoly of that market.\n\nAlbanese also got a renewed commitment to Aukus, in effect ending the dragged-out review.\n\nHe didn't receive a public dressing down – though Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister who was critical of Trump before taking up his current post as ambassador to the US, was awkwardly confronted with the president telling him \"I don't like you either\".\n\nThe tariffs remain a gripe but are at the lowest rate of any country, and in fact some Australian sectors, like beef, appear to be benefitting from the global upheaval.\n\nAnd though the Aukus review was a scare it was ultimately a false alarm.\n\nBut all of this and other factors, such as Trump's unpredictable treatment of other allies, has fuelled increased distrust of the US.\n\n\"For the first time in my lifetime, one of our two major political parties benefited in the last election from slightly distancing itself from the US,\" Mr Roggeveen said of Albanese.\n\nThe numbers vary, but polling has consistently showed Trump is unpopular here, and fewer Australians believe America is a reliable ally under his leadership.\n\nAnd yet the latest poll found that, nevertheless, about half of Australians think the nation needs its alliance with the US more than ever.\n\n\"It's one thing to say Donald Trump is difficult, Donald Trump is unpopular. It's another thing to come up with an alternative to the US right now,\" the United States Studies Centre's Jared Mondschein told the BBC.\n\n\"That's really due to Xi Jinping. In many ways, he's the gift that keeps on giving for the US in Asia.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting in Washington on Monday,  a run-in between jets from the Chinese and Australian militaries  served as a reminder of tensions in the region.\n\nBeijing, which is Australia's biggest trading partner, has embarked on a huge military build-up and it's making Canberra, and a whole host of others, nervous.\n\nMr Roggeveen says there is a belief amongst Australia's political and security experts that the country cannot defend itself independently, if it comes to that - though he is among a small cohort which disagrees.\n\nMany point to Pacific nations as a critical line of defence -  something reflected in Australia's keenness to lock as many as possible into alliances  - while a few voices argue China is in fact a potential security partner, not a threat.\n\n\"But there's a view... that the only reasonable course for Australia is to seek closer and closer relations with the United States,\" Mr Roggeveen says.\n\n\"A lot of allies and partners throughout the region are grabbing for the uncertainty of a term-limited Trump administration over the certainty of a Xi Jinping-led China,\" Mr Mondschein adds.\n\nSo while the way Australians feel about the US is changing, it is hard to see it greatly straying from the path it is on any time soon."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pg8pzp2no","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:43:58.890+00:00","title":"Lisbon funicular crash initial report reveals litany of failings","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A preliminary report into a fatal funicular crash in Lisbon on 3 September 2025 reveals a series of critical safety failures, including the use of a defective underground cable that was never certified for passenger transport and had not been tested before installation.

detailed a litany of failings.\n\nPortugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigations Bureau said an underground cable - which acted as a counterweight between two carriages and broke, causing the crash - was defective and had never been certified for passenger transportation.\n\nIt said the cable was not technically suitable and was acquired in 2022 by Carris, the company running Lisbon's public transport that now says it has dismissed its head of maintenance of furniculars and trams.\n\nThe 140-year-old Glória funicular, popular with tourists, derailed and crashed into a building on 3 September.\n\nThere were 11 foreigners among those killed, including the three British nationals, while another 20 people were injured.\n\nThe preliminary report, released on Monday, said there had been no oversight by Carris engineers and the cable was not tested before it was installed.\n\nThe supervision and maintenance of the funicular by a company outsourced by Carris also did not work properly - apparently giving the Glória funicular the all-clear on the morning of the disaster, though it is not certain if the check actually took place that day.\n\nThe emergency brake system, which the driver correctly tried to apply when the cable snapped, did not function properly and was never tested in advance, the report said.\n\nHowever, the preliminary report emphasised that the information gathered to date was \"incomplete\", with further tests and analysis needed.\n\n\"The guilt or responsibility of any organisation or person involved in the incident should not be presumed,\" it said.\n\nLisbon's Mayor Carlos Moedas, who was re-elected on 12 October despite opposition accusations he had failed in his duty of oversight over the city's funiculars, told SIC television that the report \"reaffirms that the unfortunate tragedy... was due to technical and not political causes\".\n\nCarris issued a statement stressing it was \"not possible at this time to state whether or not the non-conformities in the use of the cable are relevant to the accident\", referring to a passage in the report that notes the same cables had been in use on the Glória funicular for 601 days without incident.\n\nAccording to the accident report: \"At this point in time, it cannot be said whether the use of this type of non-compliant cable intervened, or what intervention it had, in the rupture... and it is certain for the investigation that there were other factors that had to intervene.\"\n\nThe company stressed that, though the cables had been brought into use under the current board of directors, who took office in May 2022, the acquisition process took place under the previous board.\n\nAmong other safety recommendations to be further detailed are that Carris implement a new safety management system in line with European best practice.\n\nThe full report will take about 11 months to complete. If that is delayed, a more detailed interim report will be released instead.\n\nMeanwhile, all Lisbon cable cars have been ordered to be out of service until the necessary safety checks are put in place.\n\nAll braking systems need to be reviewed to see if they can stop the carriages if the cable fails - which had not been the case in the Glória accident - the report advised.\n\nIt also recommended closing a loophole whereby Lisbon's historic funiculars are exempt from legal and supervisory oversight that applies to other cable-driven forms of transport."}]}
