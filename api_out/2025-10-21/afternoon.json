hostages who were killed and whose bodies were handed over to IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and Shin Bet forces inside the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Once in Israel, the bodies will be received in a military ceremony before being taken to Tel Aviv’s National Institute for Forensic Medicine for official identification.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF in an earlier statement asked the public to act with “sensitivity and wait for the official identification, which will first be provided to the families of the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and

But they seem to have relatively little reason to do so right now.\n \n\n   \n  Generally speaking, it’s  the side that made extraneous policy demands that loses  politically in shutdowns. In this case, that’s the Democrats, who are demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. People overwhelmingly say they don’t like using shutdowns as leverage – by massive margins, in fact.\n \n\n   \n  But public opinion on this shutdown hasn’t gone that way.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats keep winning the blame game\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Democrats were “getting killed in the polls.”\n \n\n   \n  “The public understands what they’re doing; they’re doing the wrong thing,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  This does not appear at all accurate.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, every quality public poll has shown Trump and Republicans continue to shoulder more blame than Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  conducted October 15-20, Americans blamed congressional Republicans more than Democrats, 50%-43%.\n \n\n   \n  The gap was larger in a  CNBC poll  conducted October 8-12. It showed Americans blamed Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, 53%-37%. (Independents blamed Trump by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, 58%-21%.)\n \n\n   \n  Before the shutdown started, polls showed the blame game favoring Democrats by between 7 and 11 points. Polling since it started has shown it favoring Democrats by between 7and 17 points.\n \n\n   \n    This is not normal\n \n\n   \n  The other longest shutdowns on record were in 1995-96 (21 days) and 2018-19 (35 days), both of which involved Republicans making the policy demand.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the blame game was against the GOP from the start and seemed to get worse as things dragged on.\n \n\n   \n  In 1995-96, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll before the shutdown showed people were prepared to blame Republicans by 11 points. Polling after the shutdown began showed the GOP getting blamed by more than 20 points.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018-19, pre-shutdown polling showed Americans were predisposed to blame Trump and the Republicans by 14-15 points. Most quality polls after it began showed Americans blaming the GOP by 20 or more points.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the GOP was arguably fighting a losing battle before things even got started, and then it became clear they weren’t winning either politically or policy-wise. So they gave up.\n \n\n   \n  That’s been flipped on its head now.\n \n\n   \n  A big reason appears to be that what Democrats are demanding  is actually popular  – unlike, for instance, the GOP’s demand of building Trump’s border wall in 2018-2019. The new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 72% of Americans and even 51% of Republicans want health care subsidies to be extended. Those numbers have also been consistent.\n \n\n   \n    How much of a stomach do Democrats have?\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Americans believe the policy goal that they very much want is worth continuing the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That could be a tougher ask, especially as some key impacts of the shutdown set in. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck later this week, for example. Small business loans will be held up. Aid to low-income Americans like food stamps  could soon be halted .\n \n\n   \n  But the looming impacts cut both ways. November 1 is as an especially important deadline for Democrats’ policy demand. It’s when open enrollment for the Obamacare plans begins.\n \n\n   \n  At that point, many Americans would begin to see the significantly higher premiums caused by letting the subsidies lapse – in most cases  doubling or close to doubling , according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.\n \n\n   \n  There is a school of thought that Democrats could give up at that point, believing they had forced Republicans to own the premium hikes and that they had cast a spotlight on the fact that the GOP stood in the way of renewing them.\n \n\n   \n  But if you’re a Democrat and you’re looking at these polls, you have to be intrigued by the possibility of holding out. What if Republicans really get scared about owning those premium hikes – like  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  even Trump’s own pollster  have warned them – and suddenly feel compelled to come to the table?\n \n\n   \n  Democrats haven’t had many wins since the November election, and this situation presents at least the possibility of a very significant one.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps as significantly, how would a Democratic base that has sharply criticized their party’s leaders for their lack of fight react to their side throwing in the towel when it looked like they were on the winning side of the issue?\n \n\n   \n  Plenty will play out over the next 10 days. But the plot is significantly thicker than in past shutdowns.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/science/elon-musk-sean-duffy-nasa-spacex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:01:00Z","title":"Elon Musk calls acting NASA chief ‘Sean Dummy’ as SpaceX moon contract hangs in the balance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk publicly criticized Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, calling him 'Sean Dummy' and accusing him of poor judgment and low intelligence, in response to Duffy’s assertion that SpaceX is behind schedule on its $2.9 billion lunar lander contract for NASA’s Artemis III mission, scheduled for mid-2027.

(Duffy, a former member of Congress, is a world champion lumberjack speed climber.)\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Duffy said in an interview with CNBC that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.\n \n\n   \n  “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They do remarkable things,” Duffy told Fox News about SpaceX on Monday, “but they’re behind schedule.” NASA’s pivotal moon-landing mission, called Artemis III, is planned for as soon as mid-2027.\n \n\n   \n  Musk spent Tuesday morning posting about how SpaceX is “the only company to successfully human-certify a new orbital space vehicle in the US” and resposting criticisms of Duffy.\n \n\n   \n  Musk also responded to reporting from the Wall Street Journal that Musk ally Jared Isaacman may be back in the running to lead the agency, as Duffy jockeys to fold NASA completely under the Transportation Department. Trump had pulled Isaacman’s nomination for NASA administrator  earlier this year  – the same week Musk departed his role in Washington.   Though Trump cited Isaacman’s “prior associations” as the reason for pulling the nomination,  CNN previously reported  that a faction of people in Trump’s inner circle advocated against Isaacman after Musk left Washington and shortly before Musk’s very public falling out with the President.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman — who has twice flown to orbit on SpaceX capsules he commissioned — has reportedly been back in the running, and a source familiar with the matter confirmed he has met with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Musk  posted  on Tuesday, as well as reposting others’ praise for Isaacman.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman told CNN he has “never expressed confidence about renomination at any point” and that he has “a lot of respect for Secretary Duffy and I have always enjoyed the time I’ve spent with him.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful to all the supporters and to President Trump for the consideration, and most of all, I just wish to see NASA continue to shine as the world’s most accomplished space agency,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for Duffy said that the transportation secretary “never said he wants to keep the (NASA) job himself.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson added that Duffy has suggested NASA “might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but reiterated he has not said he would like to become NASA’s permanent leader.\n \n\n   \n  “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he’s been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson said. “The bottom line is that Secretary Duffy is here to serve the President, and he will support whomever the President nominates.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/climate/iceland-mosquito-discovery","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Iceland Just Found Its First Mosquitoes","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iceland, long protected by its extreme cold from mosquitoes, has confirmed the first wild occurrence of the species Culiseta annulata in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, after being discovered by Björn Hjaltason in October 2025.

This week, scientists announced the discovery of three mosquitoes — marking the country’s first confirmed finding of these insects in the wild.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes are found almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of Antarctica and, until very recently, Iceland, due to their extreme cold.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquitoes were discovered by Björn Hjaltason in Kiðafell, Kjós, in western Iceland about 20 miles north of the capital Reykjavík. “At dusk on October 16, I caught sight of a strange fly,” Hjaltason posted in a  Facebook group  about insects, according to  reports  in the Icelandic media. “I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  He contacted Matthías Alfreðsson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, who drove out to Hjaltason’s house the next day. They captured three in total, two females and a male. Alfreðsson identified them as mosquitoes from the Culiseta annulata species.\n \n\n   \n  A single mosquito from a different species was discovered many years ago on an airplane at the country’s Keflavík International Airport, Alfreðsson told CNN, but this “is the first record of mosquitoes occurring in the natural environment in Iceland.”\n \n\n   \n  The Culiseta annulata species is native to a huge part of the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia. It appears well adapted to colder climates, primarily because adults can ride out the cold in sheltered places, Alfreðsson said. “This allows them to withstand long, harsh winters when temperatures drop below freezing.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the mosquito arrived in Iceland, but theories include the possibility it came via ships or containers. Further monitoring will be needed in the spring to see whether the species can survive the winter and “truly become established in Iceland,” Alfreðsson said.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes, which tend to thrive in warmth and humidity, are likely to be  one of the few real winners  as the planet heats up.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, bringing more heat, storms and floods, the range of these disease-carrying insects is increasing, according to a growing body of research. Rising temperatures also allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland is no stranger to the impacts of climate change and has experienced record-breaking heat. In May, temperatures in parts of the country were  more than 18 degrees  Fahrenheit above normal. This extreme heat was made 40 times more likely by climate change, an  analysis  from the World Weather Attribution network found.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a still a lot of unknowns about how mosquitoes are behaving as the world warms and experts urge caution when it comes to linking Iceland’s discovery with global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Alfreðsson said he’s not sure climate change played a role in the discovery but “warming temperatures are likely to enhance the potential for other mosquito species to establish in Iceland, if they arrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Iceland may have been hospitable to these insects even in the absence of climate change, said Colin J. Carlson, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University School of Public Health. Mosquitoes have been found  quite far north  into Scandinavia, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Climate change may have made this more likely, but I’m not convinced it’s a clear, direct impact,” Carlson said. “The truth is, we just don’t know a lot about endemic mosquito range shifts that are already happening.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:25:00-04:00","title":"North Carolina Senate Advances New Congressional Maps to Help Republicans Gain Additional US House Seat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The North Carolina Senate has approved a new congressional redistricting map designed to give Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, targeting the current district held by Democrat Don Davis.

additional US House seat \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:25 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The North Carolina Senate approved a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party’s majority in the US House after next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The vote   came one day after Republican lawmakers who control North Carolina’s legislature  formally opened debate on the map . It targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines aim to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP currently controls 10 seats under the map used in last year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  The map is now in the North Carolina House, which is expected to vote on it Wednesday. State law does not give Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is the latest GOP-controlled state to accede to President Donald Trump’s demands  to take up drawing new district lines  to prevent Democrats from flipping the US House. Off-year elections generally favor the party out of power in the White House, and Democrats need to gain just three more seats to gain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  A Democratic-controlled House could thwart Trump’s agenda and launch investigations during the final two years of his presidency into his actions and those of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  Battles over congressional districts are underway around the country – after Trump kick-started the fight by  pushing Republicans in Texas  to craft new maps to help the party pick up five more seats.  Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom , have responded with their own redistricting push that asks voters next month to replace the state’s current congressional maps with new ones that aim to net the party five US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  During the debate this week, North Carolina Republicans made clear their political goals.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats take back the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” said state Sen. Ralph Hise, the Republican helping oversee the map legislation. He claimed that Democrats across the country had gerrymandered maps to favor their party in previous redistricting cycles.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina is fighting fire with fire,” he added in a statement. “If Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies want to try and take control of Congress to force their liberal agenda on the American people, then we’re going to respond in kind.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger also defended the vote, arguing that Democrats across the country have “spent decades” gerrymandering states they control.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina Republicans will not sit quietly and watch Democrats continue to ignore the will of the people in an attempt to force their liberal agenda on our citizens,” Berger said in a statement. “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to Trump’s demands without regard for the state’s voters.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,” Davis said in a statement, noting that the district elected him and voted for Trump in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “What is happening today … is a response from a president who has demanded fealty from members of his party who control legislatures across this country,” Democratic state Sen. Julie Mayfield said during the floor debate on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat, state Sen. Michael Garrett, cast Tuesday’s vote as a perilous moment for American democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “Future historians will look back at 2025 and ask, ‘When democracy was openly under assault, when a president demanded states rig their elections, when millions took to the street, begging their leaders to protect their rights, what did those in power do?’” Garrett said. “Did they stand with the people or did they stand with the powerful?”\n \n\n   \n   The story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-forecast-track-path-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:57:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Expected to Become Hurricane, Threatens Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday, October 25, 2025.

Its track is unclear, but it’s bringing a dangerous threat \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  won’t be wrapping up quietly.\n \n\n   \n  The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa’s worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it’s still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Days of rain and wind\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.\n \n\n   \n  Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n \n\n   \n  Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.\n \n\n   \n    So… will it hit the US?\n \n\n   \n  It’s unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/louvre-heist-jewels-recovery-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"14:49:00Z","title":"Stolen Louvre Jewelry Estimated to Be Worth $102 Million, Prosecutor Says, as Search Continues","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, occurring on a Sunday morning, resulted in the theft of high-value royal jewelry, including a tiara and necklace from Queen Marie-Amélie and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s second wife, Marie-Louise.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The jewelry taken from the  Louvre  Museum in Paris is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), according to a French prosecutor, as the search continues for the stolen treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French radio station RTL the value of the loot taken in Sunday’s daylight robbery had been estimated by the museum’s curator.\n \n\n   \n  “This sum is indeed spectacular, but we must remember that this damage is economic. But it has nothing parallel or comparable to the historical damage caused by this theft,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 100 investigators are involved in the manhunt to track down the criminals who made off with artifacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Experts fear that the prospects of recovering the jewelry are slim. But Beccuau warned that the thieves may struggle to obtain the loot’s value if they chose to dismantle the pieces to resell the jewels or melt down the metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre remained closed on Tuesday, in accordance with its scheduled opening times, but is due to reopen on Wednesday. The Apollo Gallery targeted by the thieves will remain closed.\n \n\n   \n    How did the heist happen?\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.\n \n\n   \n  Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutors say it took the robbers four minutes to break into the gallery, snatch the jewelry, and leave.\n \n\n   \n  “At 9:34 a.m., half an hour after opening, two men wearing yellow vests broke a window,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Monday statement. The robbers “left at 9:38 a.m,” and left on two scooters “along the banks of the Seine.”\n \n\n   \n  The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n    What was stolen?\n \n\n   \n  Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n    Wider implications for France\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Will the jewelry be recovered?\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it’s lost forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Past heists\n \n\n   \n  The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum’s walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.\n \n\n   \n  It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.\n \n\n   \n  More recent heists at other European museums include the  theft of four ancient gold artefacts  from a museum in the Netherlands in January.\n \n\n   \n  Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National

about long-term impact of shutdown \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown didn’t deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors’ center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.\n \n\n   \n  “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that’s what worries me the most.”\n \n\n   \n  While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism’s impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”\n \n\n   \n  Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they’re bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he’s not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.\n \n\n   \n  “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation’s capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to  close its museums  and the National Zoo on October 12.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC’s trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s data  on daily train station entries and bus boardings.\n \n\n   \n    Concerns about long-term impact of the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, a non-profit marketing group that promotes the nation’s capital, also warned of the shutdown’s economic impact on the city, which  lost about $47.4 million  in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”\n \n\n   \n  And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.\n \n\n   \n  With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.’”\n \n\n   \n  She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.\n \n\n   \n  With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they’re not going to have the full experience that they’re used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.\n \n\n   \n  “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson’s group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  In Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group’s communication’s director. “We don’t know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We’ll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/trump-putin-meeting-possible-delay-russia-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:36:00-20:00","title":"Trump’s hopes for quick second summit with Putin have stalled out","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's hopes for a quick summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled, with the U.S. administration now stating there are no plans for a meeting in the immediate future.

Now, it appears, that timeline is unlikely.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also said the US and Russia had “agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,” and officials had expected Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to lay the groundwork for the Trump-Putin summit. But multiple officials told CNN that diplomatic engagement, too, was no longer happening — at least for the time being — and one source said Rubio and Lavrov had divergent expectations about a possible end to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Rubio and Lavrov spoke by phone Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call. Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” the administration official said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the US described the call as “productive,” a source familiar with the matter told CNN that officials felt afterward that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, and there was a sense that Rubio was not likely to recommend moving forward on a Putin-Trump meeting next week. The source said Monday that Rubio and Lavrov could speak again this week.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Lavrov rejected the notion of freezing the conflict — an idea put forward by Trump after  a meeting with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week and backed by Kyiv and Europe as part of negotiations toward an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin had previously sought to tamp down expectations of a rapid Trump-Putin summit, saying after the US president first announced it that it “may happen within two weeks or a bit later.” It added at the time that talks between Rubio and Lavrov would mark the first step toward organizing the Russia-US summit in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the summit cannot be postponed, because no date was ever set.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot postpone what has not been scheduled,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The White House stressed Trump was still committed to brokering peace in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently worked towards finding a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to end this senseless war and to stop the killing,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN. “He has courageously engaged parties on all sides and will do everything in his power to achieve peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Zelensky asserted that Russia “became less interested in diplomacy” after the United States declined to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday in his daily address. “This is a signal that this very issue — the issue of long-range capabilities — may be the indispensable key to peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “The greater Ukraine’s long-range capabilities,” Zelensky added, “the greater Russia’s willingness to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before revealing there were no immediate plans for Trump and Putin to meet, the Trump administration had come to believe that a big stand-alone meeting between Rubio and Lavrov was not essential to set the table for a summit. That is largely because Lavrov is not empowered to meaningfully move the process along, a senior administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration views calls between the two aides as effective to get a sense of where the Russian side is on certain topics, but it does not believe a big meeting between the two would be useful, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat described Lavrov as someone who is “100% loyal to Putin but who’s never in the room when real important decisions are being taken.”\n \n\n   \n  “To negotiate with Lavrov is somewhat a diversion while the important discussions are only with Putin himself,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the conversations about setting up a meeting between the two diplomats remains fluid, a senior administration official said, adding that it is possible they meet on the sidelines of a meeting of world leaders organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is set to take place next week in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  In Rubio and Lavrov’s Monday phone call, they discussed “next steps” to follow up on the call between their two presidents last week about a possible end to the conflict in Ukraine, according to a brief US State Department readout. Rubio “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump’s vision,” according to the readout.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, described the call as a “constructive discussion” that dealt with “possible concrete steps to implement the understandings” Trump and Putin reached during their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  It has been more than two months since Trump held his last  in-person summit  with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. The nearly three-hour meeting ended without a deal as both leaders touted progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters Saturday.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:01:00Z","title":"Republicans are poised to add a seventh GOP seat in Donald Trump’s redistricting battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A nationwide redistricting battle is unfolding in 2025, with Republican-controlled state legislatures in multiple states—including North Carolina, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, Ohio, and Utah—advancing new congressional maps to gain additional seats ahead of the 2026 midterms.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:01 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A full-scale redistricting battle is raging across the country – largely at President Donald Trump’s behest – with Republican-controlled legislatures in multiple states facing increasing calls from the president and his allies to eke out additional GOP seats to fortify the party’s majority in the US House.\n \n\n   \n  In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the legislature are moving quickly to advance a new congressional map, joining a growing list of states carrying out an extraordinary redistricting push ahead of next year’s midterm elections. The state is poised to join  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed map targets the US House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis and aims to give Republicans the advantage in 11 out of 14 House seats from North Carolina, up from the current 10.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State is the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina have acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move. It moves next to the state House.\n \n\n   \n  Under North Carolina law, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein does not have veto power over the maps. This week, he called the Republican actions “outrageous.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are failing the voters of North Carolina by deciding for them who their congressional representation will be,’” Stein said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen. Val Applewhite said Republican lawmakers were going along with Trump’s “coordinated national effort to reshape this country’s political map in his image to guarantee one thing: that Donald Trump and only Donald Trump remains in power.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/israel-vance-trump-administration-ceasefire","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:17:00-04:00","title":"Vance downplays concerns over ceasefire in visit to Israel as Trump administration officials privately worry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance visited Israel to reinforce the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, downplaying concerns over its fragility despite internal administration worries.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:17 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance downplayed concerns about the fragility of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire while speaking in Israel on Tuesday, even as some Trump administration officials are privately concerned the deal could fall apart, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said at a news conference, adding, “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance also declined to put a timeline on both the return of all Israeli hostage remains and Hamas’ disarmament, saying it will “take a little bit of time” and that security and humanitarian structures must be implemented in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “If Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal, very bad things are going to happen. But I’m not going to do what the president of United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s presence in the region is meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it.\n \n\n   \n  One US official characterized it as “Bibisitting.” Another framed it as a “show of force from the highest-ranking person after the president himself” to make the administration’s view clear that the ceasefire needs to be durable enough to “outlast inevitable skirmishes.”\n \n\n   \n  The sources added that the general belief among US officials involved in the negotiations is that the truce is most threatened in the short term, which is why the trip needed to happen so soon after  Trump’s visit  just last week.\n \n\n   \n  The concerns reached new heights after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack over the weekend that killed two IDF soldiers. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  US officials worked to minimize the fallout of the strikes and ensure the ceasefire was not threatened, the sources said. And while Israel and Hamas each accused the other of violating the deal, both sides  ultimately reaffirmed  their commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president said Tuesday that it is going to be a “constant effort” to “mediate these disagreements as they come up.” He asserted the trip “had nothing to do with events in the past 48 hours.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance was accompanied at the news conference by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the key US architects of the deal. The pair are in Israel this week as the administration begins to work on the longer-term goals of the president’s  20-point peace plan  for the region.\n \n\n   \n  While there, Witkoff told Israel the country’s response to violence from Hamas needs to be proportionate to the violation, according to an Israeli source familiar with the matter. Witkoff also emphasized that the next 30 days are crucial for the deal to hold and for talks to enter the second phase, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israelis, meanwhile, are ramping up pressure on the US to demilitarize Hamas before talks move on to the reconstruction phase, an Israeli official said.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes as Trump himself has argued both privately and publicly that Sunday’s attack on IDF soldiers wasn’t the work of Hamas leaders but part of a “rebellion.” He has said that some members of Hamas “got very rambunctious,” but he believes the group is still committed to the truce and negotiations, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did, however, threaten to have the group “eradicated” if ultimately necessary.\n \n\n   \n  The president wrote on social media Tuesday that “great allies” in and around the Middle East would “welcome the opportunity” to enter Gaza and “straighten [out] Hamas” if they continue to “act badly.”\n \n\n   \n  Trum﻿p said he told these unspecified countries “not yet,” as “there is still hope that Hamas will do what is right.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Aileen Graef contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/media/warner-bros-wbd-sale-paramount-skydance-suitors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00+00:00","title":"Warner Bros.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A New York man who was convicted of charges related to the  January 6, 2021, Capitol attack  was arrested Sunday on a charge that he threatened to kill Democratic  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries .\n \n\n   \n  According to New York State Police, an anonymous source told the FBI that the man, Christopher Moynihan, had said on Friday that “in a few days, he would kill Congressman Jeffries in New York City for ‘the future,’” court records say.\n \n\n   \n  Moynihan was previously sentenced to nearly two years in prison for his participation in the  Capitol attack  after being convicted of obstructing an official proceeding, disorderly conduct in a restricted area, and other, similar charges.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald  Trump pardoned  Moynihan — along with others convicted of January 6 offenses — earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Tuesday, Jeffries thanked law enforcement for apprehending Moynihan before criticizing Trump’s “blanket pardon” of January 6 defendants.\n \n\n   \n  “Threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people,” Jeffries wrote.\n \n\n   \n  A New York judge ruled that Moynihan will stay in prison while awaiting a hearing Thursday to determine whether he can be released pending trial on a charge of making a terroristic threat. No attorneys are listed for Moynihan in the New York case and CNN has attempted to reach family members.\n \n\n   \n  The anonymous source told the FBI they suspected Moynihan of recent drug abuse as well as an “increase” in “homicidal ideations,” according to New York State Police.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say that Moynihan, in a text message sent to an anonymous source on Friday, wrote that “Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live” and “Even if I am hated he must be eliminated.” He is also accused of sending a text that said, “I will kill him for the future.”\n \n\n   \n  On January 6, 2021, Moynihan entered the Senate chamber and rummaged through pages in a notebook on one of the senator’s desks, taking photos of the pages with his phone. He was not accused of attacking police or acting violently that day.\n \n\n   \n  Before being sentenced in the Capitol attack case, Moynihan’s attorneys told the Washington, DC, judge presiding that their client “has struggled with addiction to opiates” and that past misdemeanor convictions of possessing a controlled substance and petty larceny “all stem from a time when he was in the throes of that addiction.”\n \n\n   \n  The DC judge recommended Moynihan receive mental health and drug abuse treatment while serving his term for the January 6 convictions.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys, in asking for a lighter sentence from the judge, wrote that prior to his entering the Capitol, “Mr. Moynihan had grown increasingly engaged in politics during the Trump presidency and spent much of his spare time perusing political content on the internet.”\n \n\n   \n  Law enforcement agencies have been on edge over threats against political and public figures in the wake of several high-profile assassinations, including recently right-wing commentator  Charlie Kirk,  who was brutally shot and killed during a campus debate event this summer.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/marine-corps-artillery-155-mishap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-04:00","title":"Marine Corps Artillery Mishap Part of Unusual Firing Over Highway","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the US Marine Corps' 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, a 155mm artillery shell fired from an M777 Howitzer prematurely detonated over the I-5 interstate highway, causing at least one fragment to strike and damage a California Highway Patrol cruiser.

Marine Corps artillery mishap part of unusual firing over highway \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Marine Corps is no stranger to firing live ordnance as part of training, but it had been years — more than 70, according to one US official — since Marines had fired artillery over a stretch of the I-5 interstate in California like troops did last weekend during the Corps’ 250th birthday celebration.\n \n\n   \n  The very first shell fired as part of the demonstration exploded on Saturday over the interstate, stretches of which  serve as the busiest highway in America , dropping at least one shell fragment on a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps is currently investigating what went wrong with the round, a 155mm artillery shell that had been fired by an M777 Howitzer. The day before Marines had successfully fired more than two dozen shells from the same batch of artillery, according to the official, lending more questions as to what happened on Saturday and why.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported there were no injuries from the incident, which the California Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Tony Coronado called “an unusual and concerning situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps did not respond to questions about who made the decision to fire over I-5, when the last time was that the Marine Corps fired artillery over the interstate, or if there were broader concerns regarding the artillery batch the shell that prematurely detonated came from.\n \n\n   \n  The US has been rapidly increasing its production of the 155 mm shells, more than  tripling production since 2022  up to 40,000 rounds per month that has included opening new production facilities as part of $5.5 billion in US investment in manufacturing the munitions. The driver of that surge in production has been Ukraine’s need for the shells in its protracted war repelling Russian forces, with the US already having sent  more than 3 million 155 mm rounds  to the country since the start of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom, in an escalating spat with the White House over the safety of Saturday’s demonstration, had closed the interstate ahead of the exercise, which involved firing artillery from a beach area over the highway onto land that is part of the Camp Pendleton military facility.\n \n\n   \n  After Newsom had described plans to fire shells over the highway as “dangerous” and said he was making the decision to close the highway, a spokesman for Vance had told CNN that the showcase was “an established safe practice.”\n \n\n   \n  Live-fire exercises, where real ordnance is used for training, are a common occurrence for US military units around the country. However, the specific route planned for the shells on Saturday hadn’t been used since before I-5 became an interstate in the 1950s, according to the US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Firing from the beach, firing over I-5, in theory shouldn’t have been a problem,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel who served as an artillery officer and who is currently a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The shells were high when they went over I-5 and that’s why the Marine Corps apparently said shutting down the highway was not necessary because in theory, they’d be so high they wouldn’t interfere with anyone below,” he said. “And for some reason one of them went off prematurely.”\n \n\n   \n  The batch of artillery shells used during the demonstration has likely been frozen and will not be used again until the Marines further clarify what happened, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  A  2024 Reuters investigation  of artillery production found some issues with manufacturing lines of the munitions, including cracked shells in Iowa that shut down a production line further delaying their delivery, and a US decision to change the kind of explosive used in the shell.\n \n\n   \n  Years before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US decided to move away from using TNT inside the shell to an explosive believed to be “less vulnerable to detonation by accident,” the Reuters report said.\n \n\n   \n   The Army confirmed to Reuters it reversed course and began using TNT once again after the war began, due to cost efficiency needs and to increase the production rate.\n \n\n   \n  The military services often try to put together a compelling showcase when important leaders make a visit to a military facility, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that when a VIP shows up you do something special for them is totally normal,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  What is abnormal, he added, is that the shell detonated prematurely. The 155 shells, Cancian explained, weigh roughly 95 pounds – the majority of that weight due to the shell itself, and only 15 pounds of it attributed to the actual explosive. When the shell explodes, the metal casing is meant to splinter into tiny fragments in an effort to inflict more casualties on a battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  A photo of one of those fragments on a patrol car was shared in a press release by the California Highway Patrol, which said shrapnel struck and damaged a patrol vehicle. Cancian emphasized that the patrol car was not “hit” by an artillery shell but rather struck by fragments of the shell which exploded far overhead, slowing down as they fell through the air before landing on the patrol car.\n \n\n   \n  “It went off very high, and the shell fragments came down to the ground, didn’t look like they were going very fast,” he said, adding that “obviously that should not have happened.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/government-shutdown-congress-federal-workers-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00.000+00:00","title":"What’s Happening to End the Government Shutdown?

Nothing \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:48 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats are talking to their voters who are desperate to fight. Republicans rarely reach beyond their base. And President Donald Trump, supposedly the world’s greatest dealmaker, is tuned out.\n \n\n   \n  This Washington stasis explains why no end is in sight to  a government shutdown  now tied for the second-longest ahead of Trump’s expected departure for Asia at the end of the week for summits. There’s no sign he’ll emulate his first predecessor, President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of the region in 2013 because of a similar stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan B is open up the government,” Republican Senate Majority Leader  John Thune told CNN’s Manu Raju  on Tuesday, pledging to continue to pressure Democrats to accept a short-term House spending bill they’ve been blocking to try to force Republicans to extend expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  As Congress keeps doing the same thing, with the same inconclusive result, the costs of the partial closure of federal operations are escalating.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed. The administration has fired  several thousand more . On Monday, most specialists who oversee the US nuclear stockpile at the National Nuclear Security Administration got  furlough notices . More  air traffic control staffing shortages  were reported over the weekend, in an ominous foreshadowing of potential travel crunches if the impasse drags on until Thanksgiving. And time is ticking down to the expiry of  critical nutrition support  for 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Significant pain is being inflicted on federal workers who have mortgages and car payments coming due and on millions of citizens who rely on the government. But it hasn’t yet reached leaders in both parties in sufficient volume to force them to seriously negotiate on a reopening. Three weeks in, neither side has moved beyond the first stage of shutdown politics — blaming the other.\n \n\n   \n    At some point, Democrats and Republicans will have to change tactics\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have succeeded in using the shutdown to create a platform for their demands for Republicans to agree to  extend the enhanced ACA subsidies , without which millions of policies will shoot up in price at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is day 20 of the Trump Republican shutdown and the government remains closed because Republicans have zero interest in actually providing affordable health care to everyday Americans,” House Democratic Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “That’s the challenge that the country faces right now.”\n \n\n   \n  But how do Democrats turn their success in elevating a key issue into a meaningful political victory? Republicans aren’t shifting an inch on their refusal to hold talks on Obamacare subsidies until the government is opened — thereby depriving Democrats of leverage. And calls by some House progressives for multiyear extensions of the subsidies before the standoff ends appear rather optimistic.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Democratic senators, who might be looking for a way out, saw their position complicated this weekend by “ No Kings ” protests  targeting Trump . They can hardly reach a compromise that looks like caving to the president after an estimated 7 million people got off their couches on Saturday to blast him as a wannabe dictator.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic attempts to split the usually deal-hungry Trump from Republicans in Congress have so far failed.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s the way out of it? Trump,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the podcast “The Checkup,” according to a transcript released by his office. But Democrats are proving less successful than  Russian President Vladimir Putin  at getting the commander in chief to change his mind. He’s expected to lunch with GOP senators at his new “Rose Garden Club” terrace at the White House on Tuesday in a show of GOP unity.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker told CNN on Tuesday that Trump was absent from discussions. “He’s getting ready to do another trip overseas to negotiate on foreign policy issues. What he should be doing is calling Democrats to the White House and negotiating with us,” Booker said. “The urgencies are growing. But where is the president? Why is he doing nothing? Why isn’t he sitting down with people? Why isn’t he understanding that there’s no Democrat or Republican way to do this? It’s only a bipartisan way,” Booker said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, meanwhile, are enjoying their daily media appearances in which they slam Democrats for closing the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday kept his speechwriters busy finding new superlatives, accusing the opposition of pulling off the “most selfish, most dangerous political stunt in the history of the United States Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson is no closer to solving the GOP’s own conundrum. How does the party in power escape blame for huge hikes in Obamacare premiums if the subsidies expire? That tough reality explains why Democrats believe Trump, already blamed for  massive Medicaid cuts , may eventually fold. And Republicans do understand the political threat. At the weekend, they twinned their willingness to talk about a solution — if the government reopens — with a call to reshape the 15-year-old health-care law, even though they’ve never proposed a viable replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “I have said that I’m absolutely open to having conversation, but we’re not going to extend a program that is wrought with fraud, waste and abuse,” Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “Our health care system is broken, the system that they put in place,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  This will only make Democrats more wary of a deal. Reform of the ACA sounds a lot like a fresh attempt by the GOP to finally kill a law the party has been trying to eradicate since it was an idea in the 44th president’s first campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Where is the House?\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of any serious discussions to end the shutdown, political games are escalating on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is keeping the House dark, arguing that his members did their job by voting last month to temporarily fund the government, apparently ignoring all the other duties of the people’s representatives. “I refuse to allow us to come back and engage in anything until the government’s reopened,” the speaker said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  One reason Johnson might not want his members in town is they could spoil his attempt to stifle dissent after complaints about the shutdown spilled out from  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  and others. He’s also refusing to swear in  new Democratic member Adelita Grijalva , who has pledged the deciding signature to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the House fully returns to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are meanwhile arguing that as terrible as the shutdown is, they are alleviating even greater misery by fighting to extend health care subsidies. In an odd way, the extreme realities of life in Trump’s Washington might be mitigating some of the political duress that usually boils up to end shutdowns. Furloughs of federal workers don’t seem so extreme after thousands were already fired in Trump’s federal government purge. And at a turbulent moment when Trump is trying to  send troops into cities  and posting bizarre AI videos, the rituals of a government shutdown seem routine by comparison.\n \n\n   \n  In a futile and now-familiar dance unlikely to be noticed much outside the Senate chamber, Thune held a vote to pass a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government Monday evening. But Democrats stood firm for the 11th time, depriving the measure of the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune may also bring up a bill this week to pay essential workers required to show up during the shutdown. The move might put Democrats in a tough spot. But they are likely to oppose any move that would allow Trump to pick and choose which workers get salaries. And in a signal that not all Republicans are on board with their leader’s strategy shift, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville argued Tuesday that the bill could alleviate incentives to end the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has already announced that his administration has shuffled existing funds to paying military personnel and FBI officers, two of the few categories of government workers about whom he seems to care.\n \n\n   \n  His move lifted one of the usual sources of political heat that usually end up solving shutdowns. None of the others are working either.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/uk/virginia-giuffre-memoir-epstein-prince-andrew-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:39:00-04:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre raped by ‘well-known Prime Minister,’ US version of posthumous memoir claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir, 'Nobody’s Girl,' alleging that she was raped by a 'well-known Prime Minister' — widely interpreted as Prince Andrew — during her time in Epstein’s network.

\nUpdated: \n        12:39 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , one of the most prominent victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, wrote in her posthumous memoir that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and that she feared she might “die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  “In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated – and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied,” Giuffre wrote of Epstein and his circle. “I believed that I might die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  Six months after her  death by suicide  in Australia, Giuffre’s memoir “Nobody’s Girl” was published Tuesday and contains harrowing details of the abuse she allegedly suffered as a teenager, and her years attempting to get justice for herself and her fellow victims.\n \n\n   \n  In the US version, Giuffre claims she was raped by a man whom she had “taken pains to describe in my legal filings only as a ‘well-known Prime Minister.’” In the UK version, the passages are almost identical but refer to the man as a “former minister.” It was not clear what accounted for the discrepancy.\n \n\n   \n  While on the sex offender’s Caribbean island, Giuffre described how Epstein “trafficked me to a man who raped me more savagely than anyone had before.” She wrote she was 18 at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “He repeatedly choked me until I lost consciousness and took pleasure in seeing me fear for my life. Horrifically, the Prime Minister laughed when he hurt me and got more aroused when I begged him to stop,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I tearfully begged Epstein not to send me back to him,” Giuffre wrote. “I got down on my knees and pleaded with him. I don’t know if Epstein feared the man or if he owed him a favor, but he wouldn’t make any promises, saying coldly of the politician’s brutality, ‘You’ll get that sometimes.’”\n \n\n   \n  The memoir will intensify a transatlantic scandal over the proximity of the rich and powerful to Epstein, which has claimed political scalps in Britain and for months wracked Congress in the United States. Its publication will heap fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew, the disgraced British royal accused by Giuffre of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew, who’s King Charles’ brother, vehemently denies the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Facing further public outrage over his relationship with Epstein,  Andrew  announced last week he had relinquished the use of his royal titles and would no longer be known as the  Duke of York , saying: “I have decided, as I always have, to put duty to my family and country first.” He will, however, retain the title of “prince,” since he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n \n\n   \n  While Buckingham Palace would have hoped Andrew’s decision could mark the end of a scandal that has plagued the royal family for years, the latest revelations in Giuffre’s memoir will likely deepen the prince’s disgrace.\n \n\n   \n  Among those is Giuffre’s claim that Andrew’s “team” tried to hire online “trolls” to harangue her around the time she brought a civil case against the prince in New York. Giuffre alleged that, having been trafficked by Epstein, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17.\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022. Writing of that settlement, Giuffre said: “After casting doubt on my credibility for so long – Prince Andrew’s team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me – the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegation that Andrew tried to hire trolls comes after the Mail on Sunday, a British paper, reported that Andrew in 2011  asked a police officer  assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre. London’s Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” the report.\n \n\n   \n  Another damaging report found that Andrew had kept up his friendship with Epstein two months after he insisted he had broken it off. In a disastrous 2019 BBC interview, in which Andrew’s attempt to clear his name backfired spectacularly, the prince insisted he had broken off his friendship with Epstein during a walk in New York’s Central Park in December 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Newly unearthed emails have contradicted that claim. The Mail on Sunday reported that, in February 2011, a day after the British press published an image of the prince with his arm around the teenage Giuffre, Andrew wrote to Epstein: “It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/food/coca-cola-cane-sugar-launch","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-04:00","title":"Coca-Cola’s Trump-approved soda begins to roll out in the United States","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Coca-Cola has launched a new version of its cola in the United States using cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, responding to advocacy from President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Department of Justice attorney Aaron Bond said in court the agent was told he could take it back to his home in Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Parente said he was concerned moving the vehicle so far away could leave it open to being altered, and his concern seemed justified in another hearing four days later.\n \n\n   \n  A government attorney said some repairs may have been “processed or at least approved,” but couldn’t say whether any work had actually been done.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Georgia Alexakis was “troubled by what I’m hearing in terms of the repair work in particular,” the  Biden appointee  said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While the government has accounted for the missing SUV, Parente says there are more questions to answer when it comes to the where, the how and the why of the SUV’s long journey.\n \n\n   \n    Vehicle’s condition is critical to defense, attorney says\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz – who was driving a different vehicle – both entered not guilty pleas to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers. They are accused of “aggressively and erratically” following and then ramming a Border Patrol vehicle on October 4 as it was on security detail on Chicago streets.\n \n\n   \n  The incident took place as Chicago became one of the epicenters for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, with regular  protests  at a suburban ICE facility and dramatic  raids  and  patrols  in the heart of the Windy City.\n \n\n   \n  Both Martinez and Ruiz left the scene of the crash, prosecutors say, although Parente  said  his client drove “to a safe place where she pulled over and called 911” to report the shooting. She was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds and released.\n \n\n   \n  They have not denied they were closely tailing the Border Patrol vehicle through Chicago streets. But Parente says Martinez, who was shot five times after the crash, did not cause the wreck, arguing the agent was the person who actually initiated the contact by sideswiping his client, making the condition of his vehicle crucial to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The cars are the big issue,” Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The Border Patrol agent is expected to testify about his actions related to the vehicle at a November 6 status hearing. A trial for Martinez is set to start in February.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance video  obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times  shows the vehicles of Martinez and Ruiz following closely on the sides of the government SUV before the incident, but the only known video of the crash itself comes from a body-worn camera.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, who has seen the bodycam video but is not allowed to share it under a court order,  told CNN  it shows the agent behind the wheel turning into his client’s vehicle, with one  agent  heard saying “Do something, b*tch” before shots were fired.\n \n\n   \n  He also said the government has put out misleading information on Martinez. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said  in a news release  Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Parente  told  CNN his client is a licensed gun owner and had a handgun in her purse but never brandished it. The criminal complaint against her doesn’t mention she had a firearm.\n \n\n   \n  At some point after the crash, the agent, who has not been publicly named, was allowed to return home to Maine with the SUV because it was his “personal vehicle,” Bond told the court last week. It was not clear if Customs and Border Protection had consulted with prosecutors before giving that permission, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The  criminal complaint  stated the vehicle is owned by CBP, not the agent. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and asking for clarification on how the agent is connected to the SUV. Through a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office, Bond declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  At the Monday hearing, Assistant US Attorney Ronald DeWald said the agent took the vehicle to a secured parking area of a CBP station in Maine.\n \n\n   \n    Can the judge punish the government for moving the SUV?\n \n\n   \n  As Martinez’s and Ruiz’s vehicles remain impounded in an FBI garage, Alexakis told the government to return the SUV to Chicago. No alteration is allowed – not even a car wash – before the defense gets a look. And this time, it will be making the journey on the back of a flatbed tow truck.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a reasonable request,” said Alexakis. “There’s only so much you can tell from photos.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Parente told the judge he couldn’t believe a key piece of evidence had been removed from the state by one of the main figures in the case.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just the driver, this is the shooter,” Parente said incredulously in court.\n \n\n   \n  Parente isn’t the only attorney who was amazed the government’s Chevy Tahoe was allowed to leave the state. Patrick Griffin, a San Diego lawyer who has been a defense attorney in criminal cases involving Border Patrol vehicles, said the defense has a right to get access to the SUV.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not some novel concept. This is as basic as it gets,” Griffin told CNN. “It’s 101 that the vehicle needs to be maintained and needs to be able to be examined by the defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Alexakis agreed the car should be returned, Griffin says there is a high bar before the government can be punished for allowing the car to be taken away.\n \n\n   \n  In the  1984 Supreme Court decision  California v. Trombetta, justices said prosecutors are not required to preserve evidence unless they have a reason to believe it could help the defendant.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s just not obvious that the evidence would be exculpatory, then you must show bad faith,” said Griffin.\n \n\n   \n  Even then, the Supreme Court said, it may not matter if the defense has other evidence that can still prove innocence.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, said he had asked the court to order DHS “to preserve and maintain any and all records, emails, text messages, documents, notes and other materials related to” the Martinez case.\n \n\n   \n  While Parente has focused in court on the physical condition of the SUV’s exterior, the most important piece of evidence is probably inside the Tahoe. Most vehicles now have an event data recorder – the EDR – that is similar to an airplane’s “black box.”\n \n\n   \n  “It can show all the data that leads up to a crash,” said Griffin. “Did the person swerve? Did they hit the brakes? What was the speed? And this is really just fundamental evidence that is necessary to determine what happened.”\n \n\n   \n    ICE detainees and officials have been suddenly moved\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time concern has been raised about important elements in a Department of Homeland Security-related case being quickly moved from one state to another – although it usually involves people rather than physical evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people who have been arrested in immigration cases this year – including  Mahmoud Khalil ,  Badar Khan Suri  and  Rümeysa Öztürk  – were quickly moved hundreds of miles away to remote detention facilities shortly after being taken into custody, frustrating the efforts of their families and attorneys to gain their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Last week,  Arthur Berto , a 13-year-old boy who was taken by ICE after an arrest for allegedly threatening another student at school, was transferred to a juvenile facility in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The Massachusetts-based federal judge in that case ruled he didn’t have the authority to decide whether Berto should be freed because the child had crossed the Massachusetts border an hour before his family’s petition was filed. Defense attorney Andrew Lattarulo told CNN last week he was still working to find an attorney in Virginia to represent his client.\n \n\n   \n  Even ICE officials have sometimes been difficult to track down.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate case  in Chicago challenging federal agents’ use of riot control munitions and tear gas against protesters and journalists, Judge Sara Ellis asked an ICE interim field director to testify in court and explain why an order she issued appeared to be ignored.\n \n\n   \n  But the government  announced  one business day before the Monday hearing the official  had been reassigned to Washington, DC, and  other officials  would have to testify in his place.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she would accept the last-minute substitution as long as those officials can answer her questions.\n \n\n   \n  But until the defense team actually gets a look at the vehicle and if anything has changed in the 2,000-mile round trip, legal experts say it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will be punished for allowing it to be moved.\n \n\n   \n  “The question arises whether the car will have been altered in a material way,” said Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan law professor who has written  books  on the rules of evidence. “If they haven’t done anything to the car, then maybe ‘no harm, no foul’ if they bring it back.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether rules of evidence were actually broken or not, Martinez’s attorney says it should raise concern.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a case involving the Border Patrol shooting of a US citizen in broad daylight and lack of integrity in this investigation is alarming,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/omaha-emergency-landing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-05:00","title":"Plane Makes Emergency Landing After Pilots Lose Contact With Flight Attendants and Hear Banging on Cockpit Door","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An American Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines, Flight 6469, departed from Omaha’s Eppley Airfield at 6:41 p.m. local time en route to Los Angeles and made an emergency landing just 18 minutes later after pilots lost contact with flight attendants and heard banging on the cockpit door.

Russian drones plunge parts of Ukraine into darkness, as Zelensky turns to Europe again \n       \n  By Tim Lister, Kosta Gak and Victoria Butenko CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:58 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As temperatures drop in Ukraine, Russia has stepped up drone attacks on power facilities supplying millions of homes across the country.\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that the Russian military is repeatedly hitting the same areas to aggravate the population’s suffering. The northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy – adjoining Russia and Belarus – have seen constant attacks over the past month.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of people in Chernihiv were without power or water on Tuesday after more than 50 drones and missiles targeted essential facilities overnight. Two attack drones hit a heat supply facility and another energy installation, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, some 20 Russian drones targeted the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, according to Chaus, killing two men and two women.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has targeted Chernihiv’s power infrastructure on 15 days over the last month, according to the regional energy company.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a  massive  Russian attack on energy facilities in several regions, including Kyiv, on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s tactics are to kill people and terrorize them with cold,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  And the Ukrainians see another new Russian tactic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians are deliberately launching unmanned aerial vehicles that continuously circle over damaged facilities, making it impossible to carry out work safely and deliberately prolonging the humanitarian crisis,” Ukraine’s energy ministry said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has developed a mix of drones and missiles in its attacks on energy infrastructure that sometimes overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. In Sumy, which borders Chernihiv, power is yet to be fully restored in the town of Shostka and surrounding area after strikes two weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  After the latest strikes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on allies “to urgently mobilize additional assistance for Ukraine’s resilience: from energy equipment to energy sources and air defense capabilities.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are 203 key facilities in Ukraine that we need to protect with air defense systems,” Zelensky said earlier this month, most of them to do with electricity, gas and water.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government has a two-pronged response to the growing Russian onslaught: more and better air defenses and longer-range missiles to intensify  Ukraine’s own attacks  on critical Russian infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not getting  US Tomahawk  cruise missiles, as had been anticipated in Kyiv and it’s still chronically short of air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Just a few weeks ago, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin felt real pressure and the threat of Tomahawks and immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday. “As soon as the pressure eased a little, the Russians began to try to jump off the diplomatic bandwagon.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials are anxious that US President Donald Trump is again souring on Kyiv ahead of a possible summit with Putin in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source described Zelensky’s meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday as tense – if constructive overall. Zelensky himself said that “after many rounds of discussion” they had agreed the starting point for any ceasefire is “where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than a month ago, Trump  mused  that Ukraine could win back all the territory it had lost.\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky eyes Russian assets\n \n\n   \n  Not for the first time, Zelensky is now turning to Europe for back-up, and will meet European leaders on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” Zelensky and 10   of the continent’s   leaders said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are developing measures to use the full value of Russia’s immobilised sovereign assets so that Ukraine has the resources it needs,” they added in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  About $200 billion of Russian assets in Europe have been frozen, and the European Union is exploring ways to use some of them as a loan to Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last week he would call for the EU to provide a 140-billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine to finance its war effort.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has described the idea as an illegal seizure of Russian property.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has suggested some of the frozen assets be used to fund the purchase of Patriot air defense batteries and long-range missiles. He’s aiming to procure 25 Patriot systems – but acknowledged this would take years rather than months.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and Ukraine’s European allies are also wary of a summit in Budapest hosted by Putin’s closest ally in Europe, Viktor Orban – though the Kremlin said Tuesday that the venue and date have not been confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a prime minister who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution,” Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a clear pattern in Putin’s tactics, according to analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, based in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “Whenever Trump becomes too angry or frustrated with Russia, Moscow reaches out,” Stanovaya  wrote on X  Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After Putin’s conversation with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington, “Trump’s tone seems to have shifted,” Stanovaya said. “He’s back to saying that Russia is winning, that Ukraine will have to give up territory, and that the US cannot afford to keep sending missiles. Russia’s position has not changed at all – it is the same as six months or even a year ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Sunday how Kyiv would respond if a meeting in Budapest went badly, the Ukrainian president replied: “Even when it seems you’re cornered, it’s not as hopeless as it looks.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/europe/louvre-jewelry-heist-history-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-21:10","title":"Jewelry Heist at the Louvre is Latest Problem to Beset France’s Most Famous Museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum in October 2025, involving the theft of valuable artifacts including the damaged crown of Empress Eugénie, highlights the ongoing security and infrastructure challenges facing one of the world’s most iconic cultural institutions.

By Caitlin Danaher and Camille Knight, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s audacious heist  saw thieves  break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery and make off with jewelry of “inestimable” value. The suspects carried out the burglary in just seven minutes, France’s interior minister Laurent Nuñez told radio station France Inter.\n \n\n   \n  French media reported that thieves had attempted to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but the crown was found outside the Louvre, according to French culture minister Rachida Dati. The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   \n  The robbery, which prompted the swift evacuation of visitors and the museum’s closure for the rest of the day, is only the latest in a series of troubles to befall the venerable institution.\n \n\n   \n  A Court of Auditors report obtained by Franceinfo and covering the period between 2019 to 2024 noted a “persistent delay” in updating security systems at the Louvre. The report also identified “operational implementation” of security device renovations as an issue, stating that it appeared they were “uneven and generally very limited.”\n \n\n   \n  “The obsolescence cycle of the museum’s technical equipment has accelerated more significantly than the pace of investment made by the institution to address it,” the report concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. King Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793. Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French. But the large crowds entering through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building – and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, French newspaper  Le Parisien  reported on a confidential letter sent from the president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning of the dilapidated state of one of Europe’s top attractions.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, dated January 23 and confirmed to CNN by the Louvre, des Cars requested urgent help to address a slew of issues affecting the museum. She warned of an increase in damage to the museum’s spaces, with some areas becoming “very deteriorated.”\n \n\n   \n  Problems included water leaks, overcrowding, and worrying temperature fluctuations which threatened to “endanger the conservation of works of art,” the memo detailed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum president cautioned that the Louvre was offering “insufficient” services to the public due to overcrowding, with food services and restrooms “well below international standards” in number.\n \n\n   \n  “Visiting the Louvre constitutes a physical ordeal; reaching the artworks takes time and is not always easy,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors often flock to the Salle des États to see one of the most famous artworks in the museum, if not the world, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” But the museum president called for the placement of the artwork to be reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron announced later that month that the “Mona Lisa” would get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre as part of major renovation plans. The expansion of the Parisian landmark is expected to take up to 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Just six months later, in June, the museum closed its doors for a day as workers there went on strike, complaining of unmanageable crowds, understaffing and poor working conditions in a building unable to handle its current popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s brazen daylight robbery was also not the first instance of theft to beset the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Most famously, the jewel in the Louvre’s crown, the “Mona Lisa,”  was stolen in 1911  by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia. Having slipped the painting under his clothing, Peruggia escaped the building undetected and wasn’t caught for two years. The public became fascinated by the two-year manhunt, with the daring burglary catapulting the “Mona Lisa” from a relatively unknown work to a world-renowned icon.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, two pieces of  16th-century armor  were returned to the Louvre Museum almost 40 years after they were stolen. The Renaissance-era helmet and body armor were on display in the Louvre when they were stolen overnight from May 31 to June 1, 1983. It wasn’t until March 2021 that the stolen artefacts were returned to the museum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/entertainment/sombr-tiktok-drama-concert-review","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-04:00","title":"Sombr’s TikTok drama may not be something you know about, but your kids probably do","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sombr, a 20-year-old singer known for viral singles like 'Back to Friends' and 'Undressed,' faced backlash from 25-year-old TikTok user Meg after her scathing review of his concert at The Anthem in Washington, DC.

for those who are not chronically online, we’re here to explain.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Boose is 20-year-old a singer who performs under the stage name Sombr. His singles “Back to Friends” and “Undressed” went viral earlier this year, and he’s amassed quite the fan base on and off social media.\n \n\n   \n  One of those fans is a TikTok user named Meg,  whose scathing review  of Sombr’s show at the The Anthem in Washington, DC has lit up the comment section and prompted a response from the singer.\n \n\n   \n  Calling it “one of the worst experiences of my life,” Meg, who says she is 25 years old, explained that she was excited to see Sombr’s The Late Nights & Young Romance Tour, but it ended up being “by far, genuinely, the worst concert I’ve been to in my life, for a multitude of reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  She went on to explain that the show, which she attended with her boyfriend, was filled with so many young people that it was “the closest to a middle school dance I’ve ever been since I was in middle school at a dance.”\n \n\n   \n  “The only adults in the room were the parents (of the young concert goers) and then my boyfriend and I,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meg said she tried to stick it out so she could hear her favorite songs, but regretted it as the humor skewed immature – with Sombr making references to niche memes, including  a 6-7 joke  – and, at one point, did a bit called the “Sombr dating show,” where he was solicited participants from the tween-skewing crowd to call their “toxic ex” while on stage.\n \n\n   \n  Calling the scene “cringe,” Meg also alleged that the artist made jokes that were inappropriate given the average age of the audience. She said she ended up leaving early.\n \n\n   \n  Boose seemingly responded to her post in his own  video , referring to the situation as a “TikTok drama.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am a 20-year-old artist – freshly 20 – and if you’re 25 years old, and you’re gonna come to my concert and not expect people younger than you to be there when I, the artist, am five years younger than you, it’s just a skill issue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He also took umbrage with being attacked for the tone of his jokes, noting that anyone who has followed him online knows that he has “never uttered a serious word in my life.”\n \n\n   \n  “And, also, I make jokes for 5 minutes of the concert and the rest is music,” Boose said. “Like, live a little, enjoy life.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore his latter point, toward the end of his video, he touched what appeared to be some fake grass as a “tutorial.” Telling someone to “touch grass” is a common social media diss.\n \n\n   \n  Meg later  responded , saying that even though she has often posted political content that could cause division, she’s never received as much “hate” as she did after posting her Sombr concert review video.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to both Meg and a representative for Sombr for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/nicolas-sarkozy-paris-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"07:24:00-04:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Starts Five-Year Prison Sentence for Campaign Finance Conspiracy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year prison sentence on October 21, 2025, for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors.

President  Nicolas Sarkozy  entered a prison in Paris on Tuesday on the first day of a five-year sentence, marking the first time a former leader of modern France has spent time behind bars.\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy was driven to the prison complex on Tuesday morning, waving to his supporters as he left his house.\n \n\n   \n  The car driving him was surrounded by dozens of police motorbikes and vehicles, making its way to  La Santé Prison  in southern Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy was sentenced to five years in jail for criminal conspiracy last month, for his role in a scheme to finance his 2007 presidential  campaign with funds  from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors.\n \n\n   \n  The former president, who left office in 2012, has appealed his conviction but in the meantime is expected to occupy a cell either in solitary confinement or in the so-called “VIP wing” of La Santé prison complex.\n \n\n   \n  That wing is usually reserved for prisoners who are considered unsuitable to be kept among the prison’s general population, usually out of fears for their safety.\n \n\n   \n  They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\n \n\n   \n    Notable previous inmates\n \n\n   \n  Cells in the wing are fitted with a metal bed and mattress, a small desk, a fridge, a cooking hob, a television, a shower, toilet and sink, and a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorized numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Previous inmates include Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama who was held there following his extradition from the United States after the American invasion that deposed him.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also known as “Carlos the Jackal,” spent time in the prison, as did Jacques Mesrine, a notorious 1970s murderer and bank robber, whose criminal career was portrayed in a 2008 film starring Vincent Cassel.\n \n\n   \n  Mesrine famously escaped from La Santé while dressed as a prison guard alongside fellow criminal François Besse, according to French public broadcaster France Info.\n \n\n   \n  Marco Mouly, a former prisoner in the prison’s VIP wing told BFMTV in a 2022 documentary that the prison is “alright,” comparing it to a popular European budget hotel chain.\n \n\n   \n  Another former inmate, Didier Schuller, told BFMTV that “the problem is the noise… At night, you’re woken up by people shouting.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement posted to X  shortly after the car carrying him set off for prison, Sarkozy stressed that he is an “innocent man.”\n \n\n   \n  “As I prepare to step inside the walls of La Santé prison, my thoughts go out to the French people of all walks of life and opinions,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell them with my unwavering strength that it’s not a former president of the Republic being locked up this morning, it’s an innocent man,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  The former leader said he will “continue to denounce this judicial scandal” but added that he is “not to be pitied because my wife and children are by my side, and my friends are countless.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, however, Sarkozy said he felt “a deep sorrow for France, which finds itself humiliated by the expression of a vengeance that has taken hatred to an unprecedented level.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy’s legal team has requested that he is granted an early release from jail, Christophe Ingrain, one of the lawyers, told BFMTV Tuesday morning. The court has two months to decide whether or not to grant this request.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with developments, as well as to clarify that Sarkozy has appealed his conviction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/asia/japan-female-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-04:00","title":"Hardline Conservative Sanae Takaichi Elected Japan’s First Female Leader","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative and former TV commentator, has been elected Japan’s first female prime minister in a landmark political shift, marking a turning point in a historically patriarchal nation.

Her arrival at the pinnacle of Japanese politics tops a remarkable rise, from TV presenter to flag bearer of traditional and nationalist ideals.\n \n\n   \n  In her first news conference as prime minister on Tuesday night, Takaichi focused heavily on economic issues and advancing Japan’s interests, saying that she will “work boldly and tirelessly, unafraid of change” for “the nation and its people.”\n \n\n   \n  A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has laid claim to his conservative legacy.   She becomes the fourth prime minister to hold office since he stepped down in 2020, reflecting the political deadlock in the world’s fourth largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abe, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and has visited a   controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II – both issues that spark anger in neighboring China and South Korea, who are also vital trade partners for Japan.\n \n\n   \n  She also opposes same-sex marriage, and   a growing movement to allow married couples to use separate surnames.\n \n\n   \n  Some of these stances, such as her hawkish views on China, could complicate Japan’s regional relationships. And within Japan, some worry about her economic proposals – to spend big and cut taxes – as the country struggles with sky-high inflation and living costs.\n \n\n   \n  She has openly aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to become British prime minister – known as the “Iron Lady,” a nickname that has since been used for Takaichi herself.\n \n\n   \n  “Like Thatcher, (Takaichi) is a conservative and she is also a woman in a male-dominated world,” said Shihoko Goto, vice president of programs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “That said, Thatcher was then – Japan is now. It’s facing a great deal of change, it’s facing a lot of internal domestic pressure … She will be expected, first and foremost, to deal with those immediate threats.”\n \n\n   \n  In her news conference Tuesday night, Takaichi said that she will “build a strong Japanese economy and protect Japan’s national interests at all costs through diplomacy and security.”\n \n\n   \n  Vowing to “reclaim Japan’s diplomacy and let it flourish at the center of the world,” Takaichi said that “Japan faces a major crisis from within and without. There is no time to stand still.”\n \n\n   \n  She noted that she will soon be meeting with Trump, adding that she will work to “elevate Japan-US relations to new heights.”\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s neighbors offered lukewarm responses to news of her win on Tuesday, with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying it had “noted the election results” and hoped for a “mutually beneficial relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  A South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson similarly promised to continue cooperating with “Japan’s new Cabinet,” without naming Takaichi, according to news agency  Yonhap .\n \n\n   \n    An unconventional start\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara, a city frequented by tourists for its wild deer, to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the ruling LDP party, Takaichi has been elected as a member of parliament nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.\n \n\n   \n  She was elected leader of the LDP earlier in October, beating more moderate candidates. It suggested a rightward turn for the scandal-hit party, which suffered bruising losses in the last two parliamentary elections after  discontented voters  switched to new far-right groups.\n \n\n   \n  But now as prime minister, she’ll have to answer to the populace of 120 million Japanese. Tackling the high price of goods will be one of her first challenges; for instance, the price of rice, a staple food in Japan, has almost doubled from last year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the ever-present headache of Japan’s declining birthrate, shrinking workforce and swelling elderly population. There’s a growing public backlash against mass immigration. And then there is the Trump administration and its whiplash tariffs, which shook Asian economies earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the immense challenge of winning back public trust, with the LDP experiencing its biggest crisis in decades and being stripped of its parliamentary majority under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after a political slush fund scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Simply being elected as the leader of the ruling party would usually have been enough to secure the premiership. But Takaichi’s path to power was complicated; besides losing its majority, the LDP also lost its coalition partner of 26 years, Komeito, which terminated the alliance when she won the leadership race.\n \n\n   \n  That left the LDP scrambling to find a new coalition partner – and it ultimately joined forces with the opposition Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) ahead of Tuesday’s vote.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s new cabinet will also include a female finance minister – another first for Japan. Satsuki Katayama, who also worked as a minister in Abe’s government, was appointed to the role on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “Takaichi’s rise to become Japan’s first female prime minister is more about remaking party politics than transforming foreign policy,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  “She is tasked with rebranding rather than revolutionizing her party, along with co-opting smaller parties in a realignment of legislative coalitions.”\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s party hopes she can be the answer to their recent unpopularity. But with a revolving door of prime ministers in recent years, Japan’s so-called ‘Iron Lady’ will need to deliver results quickly to stay in power.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/atlanta-airport-man-arrested","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:22:00-10:21","title":"Man Arrested Inside Atlanta Airport After Making Threats to 'Shoot It Up'","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man named Billy Joe Cagle, a convicted felon with a prior marijuana possession conviction, was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted authorities that he was armed and planning to 'shoot it up'.

Here’s how long the current shutdown has been going on:\n \n\n   \n  The last time the government shut down — which started on December 22, 2018, and went until January 25, 2019 — it lasted 35 days, making it the longest in history. It cost the United States an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n    Here are all the government shutdowns since 1981\n \n\n   \n  US agencies were first instructed in the early 1980s to stop normal operations during government funding lapses, and resume operations when Congress appropriated more money.   The first federal government shutdown happened in 1976, according to CNN research.\n \n\n   \n  While government shutdowns have become less common in recent decades — there have been six since 1990 — an increasingly partisan Washington has left Congress unable to resolve sticking points on spending for longer periods of time.\n \n\n   \n  With Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing one of the  narrowest House majorities in history,  and the GOP lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate  filibuster , the path to avoiding a shutdown was murky in the 11th hour as negotiations stalled.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Tami Luhby  has more on which government services are expected to halt , and which are likely continuing, during this shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    The last government shutdown\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown that began in December 2018 was a partial shutdown, where Congress had approved annual funding for certain agencies, allowing them to continue operations while other federal departments went dark. During that time, an estimated 800,000 people were employed at the shuttered federal agencies, and about 300,000 of those were furloughed, meaning they were not paid and asked not to report to work, according to the CBO.\n \n\n   \n  The rest were considered exempt from furlough, meaning they needed to report to work but could not receive pay. Both furloughed and exempted employees received backpay when their agencies reopened after the funding agreement was passed.\n \n\n   \n  The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the US government. That means this is a full government shutdown.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/soccer-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-ticket-allocation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-04:00","title":"Israeli Soccer Fans Banned from Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. Aston Villa Match Over Security Concerns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A ban on Israeli fans from attending Maccabi Tel Aviv’s Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham was imposed by the city’s Safety Advisory Group and supported by West Midlands Police, citing security risks and public disorder.

soccer fans being banned from attending Maccabi Tel Aviv’s match against Aston Villa \n       \n  By Amy Woodyatt, Ben Church, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maccabi Tel Aviv has said it will not accept any prospective ticket allocation from Aston Villa following a  ban  on the Israeli soccer club’s fans from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham next month due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The ban was put into place by local authorities in England and triggered condemnation from many politicians, sports organizations and Jewish groups, who have since tried to reverse the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context,” Maccabi Tel Aviv said in a  statement published to X  on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the ban and the subsequent reaction.\n \n\n   \n    Why was a ban on traveling Maccabi fans put in place?\n \n\n   \n  Aston Villa said that the decision was made following an instruction from the city of Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), which provides health and safety guidance at events and issues safety certificates for matches at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  The SAG wrote to Villa and European soccer governing body UEFA advising that no away fans should be permitted to attend the game, which takes place on November 6.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, West Midlands Police (WMP)  said in a statement  that it had deemed the match to be high risk “based on current intelligence and previous incidents” and that it agreed with the decision by local authorities to ban traveling fans.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” said WMP.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support all affected communities, and reaffirm our zero-tolerance stance on hate crime in all its forms.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened this past weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Days after the decision, the Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled on Sunday after what police described as “public disorder and violent riots” – the latest episode of fan unrest involving Maccabi fans.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Premier League match was due to be played at Bloomfield Stadium, which is shared by the two rivals, but videos on social media showed fans clashing with police both inside and outside the area.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  Sunday, Israel Police said that 12 civilians and three police officers were injured in the unrest, with nine people arrested. Authorities said that a further 16 people were detained for questioning.\n \n\n   \n  Footage released by police showed pyrotechnics and smoke grenades being thrown from the stands before kickoff, and police  said  the decision to cancel the match was made due to “endangerment of human life.”\n \n\n   \n  This comes almost a year after Maccabi supporters were beaten and injured in violent clashes in Amsterdam ahead of a Europa League game against Ajax, which Dutch authorities condemned as antisemitic.\n \n\n   \n    What have politicians said about the ban?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said that the UK government was “saddened” by Maccabi Tel Aviv’s decision to turn down its ticket allocation for the match but “respect(s) the club’s right to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson told reporters: “This government wants a Britain built for all. We will never accept antisemitism on our streets. The focus now is to ensure the game moves ahead safely and that Jewish people across the country feel secure in their communities.”\n \n\n   \n  UK authorities had previously sought to reverse the ban on Maccabi fans from attending the game at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last week that it was the “wrong decision,” adding that the “the role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”\n \n\n   \n  Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, meanwhile,  said  that the government would “find the resources” to allow Maccabi fans to attend the match next month.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the situation came “against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and  an attack  on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed.”\n \n\n   \n    What was Maccabi’s response?\n \n\n   \n  In addition to declining any possible ticket allocation to Villa Park, Maccabi said in a statement: “As a result of the hate-filled falsehoods, a toxic atmosphere has been created which makes the safety of our fans wishing to attend very much in doubt. Inflammatory rhetoric, trafficking in half-truths is never healthy, but in this particular case the remarks being generated are of the most concerning variety.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added: “We acknowledge the efforts of the UK government and police to ensure both sets of fans can attend the match safely, and are grateful for the messages of support from across the footballing community and society at large.”\n \n\n   \n  “We as a club believe that football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart and no one should feel unsafe for simply wanting to come and support their team nor feel any hesitation about being accompanied by family and friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Maccabi said it looked forward to “being able to play in Birmingham in a sporting environment in the near future,” adding that it hoped “circumstances will change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/va-therapists-treatment-sessions-limited","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"VA Therapists and Veterans Report Therapy Sessions Being Limited, Raising Alarm","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Veterans receiving one-on-one mental health therapy at VA facilities are reporting that their long-term sessions are being abruptly ended, often after only 8 to 12 sessions, despite clinical need for ongoing treatment.

\nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An edge comes to Michael’s voice when he speaks about his time serving in Afghanistan and his struggles living with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n \n\n   \n  A hardened Marine veteran, Michael — who asked to use the pseudonym to speak candidly about sensitive health issues — describes in tones that are measured but laced with irritation what he saw in conflict: vehicles being blown up, children being exploited, cellphones that could trigger unexpected detonations.\n \n\n   \n  Though he left the armed forces years ago, he still has flashbacks. To this day, he is “trying to figure out how to stop the nightmares,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It took him years to find a trusted VA therapist, who gave him a lifeline after he struggled with addiction and was hospitalized following multiple suicide attempts, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, Michael’s one-on-one sessions with the provider were suddenly terminated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Veterans Affairs hospitals, including the one where Michael gets his care, have stepped up enforcement of a policy in recent years that limits the number of long-term therapy sessions available to individuals, according to half a dozen mental health providers and VA patients     at locations across the country who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under the policy, put in place under earlier administrations, patients initially get a certain number of one-on-one therapy sessions, which can vary between four and 24 sessions, depending on the type of treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Mental health care providers at four facilities have told CNN that, whereas in the past they had discretion to extend the number of sessions based on their assessments of their patients, the VA is now pressing them to stop one-on-one sessions at the end of the allotted series, and more broadly reduce the number of patients who get this long-term care — without consideration for whether this is clinically appropriate. The providers asked not to be named for fear of retribution. \n \n\n   \n  In some cases, providers told CNN that if they pushed back on the policy, they faced disciplinary consequences, which could result in their privileges to practice therapy at VA facilities being removed. CNN has viewed some of these documents discussing disciplinary measures. Some providers said they had to justify extending care to more sessions in writing — a change from previous practice at their VA facility.\n \n\n   \n  Contacted by CNN, the VA denied veterans aren’t getting the care they need.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the department said it was not aware of providers facing disciplinary reviews for challenging a policy to limit sessions.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no limits on the number of VA appointments a Veteran can have in mental health or any other areas,” Peter Kasperowicz, the spokesperson, said.\n \n\n   \n  The VA “works with Veterans over an initial eight to 15 mental health sessions and collaboratively plans any needed follow-on care,” he said. “As part of this process, Veterans and their health care team decide together how to address ongoing needs, including whether to step down to other types of care and self-maintenance, or continue with VA therapy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is recovery, healing and helping Veterans achieve greater independence and resilience.”\n \n\n   \n  While some providers who spoke to CNN said they are given some flexibility to extend care, all said there has been a draconian effort to move patients out of individual therapy more quickly since President Donald Trump took office in January and installed Doug Collins as VA secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really, really frustrating. These people need help,” one provider said. The person stressed that some mental health conditions are “chronic,” and those patients would need treatment for life.\n \n\n   \n  Another provider described having to inform one of their patients that sessions would be ending, saying: “It was terrible. The timing wasn’t right. There were still things we were working on.”\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like it was a moral failing on my part, even though it wasn’t my fault,” the provider said. “It’s re-traumatizing for the veteran. It almost feels like I’m a perpetrator of that, having to carry out those orders.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael, the combat veteran, said that finding out his therapy sessions were to stop felt “like being abandoned — you’re thrown away like yesterday’s trash.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not ready to address all my issues on my own yet,” he said. “It feels like they took the training wheels off before I’m ready.” He has re-applied for one-on-one care and is in the middle of a   monthslong   waiting period.\n \n\n   \n    A larger debate\n \n\n   \n  Some providers said they were told the rationale for the renewed push to limit therapy sessions is to free up room for more veterans to enter the VA system and receive mental health treatment, and to move patients through the system more rapidly.\n \n\n   \n   Some   studies  do suggest that shorter-term, limited sessions can work well for particular veterans.\n \n\n   \n  And the practice of limiting longer-term mental health care for some patients is also commonplace in the private sector. “Larger hospitals and health care systems do sometimes place limits,” said Caitlin Thompson, a former VA psychologist who oversaw the Veterans Crisis Line  and suicide prevention program and now works in the private sector. “It depends on what’s clinically appropriate,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  One former VA mental health care provider, who is now in the private sector and didn’t want to give their name, said: “When insurance is paying for mental health care, utilization review is standard practice. It’s not open-ended. There are weigh stations.” It is often important to set goals and timeframes in treatment to track progress, they added.\n \n\n   \n  However, VA providers who spoke to CNN said there were problems with how the limits were being implemented at their VA facilities.\n \n\n   \n  One provider said that while they agreed with the objective to bring more veterans into the system to access care, “it should be agreed upon between the patient and the therapist” regarding when treatment should end — and not be imposed by the institution.\n \n\n   \n  Another mental health care provider at a VA facility in the western US said that because of the intensified push to limit sessions, “we have been hemorrhaging staff  ” as some mental health providers quit in frustration over the policy — at a time when the VA already has a severe shortage of psychologists,  according to a recent VA Inspector General report . \n \n\n   \n  Stephen Long, a former VA psychologist at the Northport VA Medical Center on Long Island, told CNN that he retired in 2024, in part because he was told to limit one-on-one sessions with patients.\n \n\n   \n  Longer-term, more open-ended therapy builds more trust between veterans and their therapists, he said. “If you can’t have this kind of therapy, you’ll miss opportunities to develop that trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Some veterans will need therapy for the rest of their lives, Long said. Treatment needs for physical illnesses would never simply be cut off — “If you need insulin for your diabetes, you don’t stop it,” he said — and mental illnesses should be treated the same. Some providers who spoke to CNN also said veterans often have issues that lend themselves to needing longer-term care.\n \n\n   \n  Mark Jorges, a former psychotherapist and mental health counselor at the VA hospital in Temple, Texas, says he resigned this May in part because of his frustrations over the mandate to limit sessions.  “I brought it up all the time” to leadership at his hospital, Jorges told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He says from the time he started working at that VA facility in 2021, there have been various attempts to have therapists limit sessions.\n \n\n   \n  But setting a set number of sessions   “as a directive is not appropriate clinically, because veterans have different pathologies according to what they’ve been through,” Jorges said. “You could be talking about someone with PTSD, depression, anxiety, acute stress disorder … that’s the majority of patients I saw. You can’t put a cap on it. It’s just not appropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  The American Psychological Association, the largest scientific and professional organization for psychologists in the US, told CNN it is aware of reports from VA psychologists   of mental health visits being limited for some veterans, and is looking into them.\n \n\n   \n  “Veterans deserve individualized, recovery-oriented care based in shared decision-making between the provider and the Veteran,” Katherine McGuire, the APA’s chief advocacy officer, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The VA has a great history of providing excellent mental health care by exceptionally skilled providers apt at assessing veterans’ needs and appropriate treatment options.”\n \n\n   \n  Patients were offered other options for treatment, such as group therapy or the chance to re-apply for one-on-one treatment.\n \n\n   \n  But some veterans who have come to depend on their trusted therapists say those are not palatable options.\n \n\n   \n  Michael said he was offered group therapy, but does not want to take it as he feels uncomfortable speaking about his issues in a group setting. Even when he is approved for one-on-one treatment, which can take months, he is not assured of seeing the same therapist.\n \n\n   \n  He feels uneasy about potentially seeing another therapist, he said. “It took me a long time to open up” to his trusted therapist, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jake Pannell, an Army veteran who’s been receiving one-on-one mental health treatment for PTSD and anxiety at a VA facility in Washington state for several years, told CNN that in recent months, providers have told him that “unless there’s an active crisis, they are no longer going to do just check-in visits.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve continuously received one-on-one treatments at the VA for many, many years,” Pannell said. “And as we’re starting to get notified of these things, even the providers that are taking care of these veterans are telling us that, regardless of what the condition is, or regardless of what the veteran’s going through at the time, they are limiting a certain time frame down to 8 to 12 visits.”\n \n\n   \n  Pannell, who now works for a federal workers union, has himself previously worked as a VA behavioral health counselor specializing in drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got veterans with severe PTSD, drug and alcohol issues. And that requires continuous maintenance,” he said. “Once that crisis happens, so — we have to wait ‘till veterans threaten to kill themselves before they get care?” he asked. “I’m scared to death. I’m scared to death for my veterans.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just want the care that we were promised,” the Afghanistan combat veteran said. His main concern as he’s waiting for a new set of therapy sessions, he says, is “just lettin’ everything take back over.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/slovakia-prime-minister-attacker-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:12:00-04:00","title":"Slovakia court sentences suspect in attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico to 21 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 in Handlova.

attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico to 21 years \n       \n  By Reuters, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  A Slovak court ruled on Tuesday that a man who shot and wounded Prime Minister Robert Fico last year was guilty of terrorism charges and gave him a 21-year jail sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Juraj Cintula, 72, shot at Fico five times from just over a 1-meter distance as the prime minister greeted people in the central Slovak town of Handlova in May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The verdict of the Specialized Criminal Court in the city of Banska Bystrica closes a trial that began in July and whose main question was whether Cintula, who admitted shooting Fico, was guilty of terrorism or less serious crimes of murder or attack.\n \n\n   \n  Fico, 61, was struck four times and was seriously injured in his abdomen, and also suffered injuries to his hip, hand and foot. He made his first public appearance in July last year, a few months after the attack and returned to work shortly after.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula appeared in court in a blue shirt and black hooded sweatshirt, accompanied by guards with automatic weapons. He has said he wanted to hurt but not kill Fico, because he wanted to stop him from continuing his policies which he said damaged Slovak freedom and culture.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula told reporters when leaving court on Tuesday he would “for sure” appeal the verdict. “It was unjust,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting laid bare deep divisions in Slovak society, and animosity between the populist Fico and the opposition. Fico, who has held power for 11 years over three stints since 2006, has blamed the mostly liberal, pro-EU opposition for fostering a climate of anger that led to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition accuses Fico of eroding democratic standards, media freedom, and covering up corruption.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Igor Kralik cited Cintula’s own reasoning for the attack when reading his justification for the terrorism count.\n \n\n   \n  “The court considers proven that the defendant did not attack a citizen but specifically the prime minister,” Kralik said.\n \n\n   \n  The sentence was less than the maximum of life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  The defense counsel for Cintula, a pensioner and former mine worker, stonemason, writer and public activist, argued that not every attack on an official was terrorism. It had sought a lesser sentence for an attack on a public official.\n \n\n   \n  David Lindtner, a lawyer for Fico, said it was clear that the defendant was “no pensioner but a terrorist” who wanted to set a precedent that “political confrontation should be resolved by violent means.”\n \n\n   \n  Fico returned to power in 2023 and ended state military assistance to Ukraine, sought better ties with Moscow, overhauled the public broadcaster and introduced some new criminal codes - changes critics say hurt democracy.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula has said he opposed the prime minister’s policies on Ukraine, media and culture and at his trial described the attack as a “scream against fear that is paralyzing the society”.\n \n\n   \n  Fico, who has suffered ongoing health problems related to the shooting, has said he has forgiven Cintula.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/americas/made-in-guatemala-working-conditions-as-equals-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:37:00-21:00","title":"The truth behind your clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reveals that Guatemala’s garment factories (maquilas), which supply clothing to major US brands like Carhartt, Target, and Ralph Lauren, operate under exploitative conditions with low wages, long hours, and rampant abuse.

clothing’s ‘made in Guatemala’ label \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon. Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed.

achieved one of the biggest ever shocks in European soccer \n       \n  By Jamie Barton, Issy Ronald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:25 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a small  Swedish  fishing village, there is a tiny soccer stadium tucked away beside a campsite and the shores of the Baltic Sea. It is the type of place where the land is so flat that the horizon sits just above the trees and the sky stretches so wide it seems possible to touch.\n \n\n   \n  Here, in this unassuming spot, is where one of the greatest ever stories in  European soccer  unfolded this season. No one expected Mjällby AIF, a team that plays in a village of around 1,500 inhabitants, to contend for the Swedish league. After all, its budget is a fraction of some of Sweden’s biggest teams.\n \n\n   \n  Yet somehow, on Monday, the team completed one of the sport’s biggest shocks and won the  Allsvenskan  – the top tier of Swedish soccer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 1,500 inhabitants in the village where they play, and you’re just flabbergasted when you see this elite football going on,” Erik Hadzic – a reporter for TV4 Fotbollskanalen, who has covered the team for the last five years – tells  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “Mjällby winning the Swedish championship is arguably the biggest sensation in the history of the Swedish league.”\n \n\n   \n  The tiny team from Hällevik has not just won the league, either. It has absolutely blown away the competition.\n \n\n   \n  Having lost just one game all season, it is currently 11 points ahead of nearest challenger Hammarby in second, and with its 2-0 win over IFK Göteborg, Mjällby assured the title with three games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  Win even one of its remaining fixtures – or draw two – and Mjällby will set a new record for the  most points ever  amassed by an Allsvenskan team, beating the record set by Swedish giant Malmö FF in 2010 and matched by AIK in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “Malmö is the richest club in Sweden and Mjällby has something like 15% of their budget, so everyone believed that Malmö would go on and win their third title in a row before this season started,” explains Hadzic.\n \n\n   \n  Even when Mjällby enjoyed a strong start to the season, the team still wasn’t seen as a title contender. It was only after defeating Malmö in August that “all of a sudden, it felt like, ‘Yeah, they could really make it,’” Hadzic adds.\n \n\n   \n  European soccer is no stranger to David and Goliath stories in recent years.  Leicester City ,  Bayer Leverkusen  and Montpellier have all shocked their respective leagues to claim unlikely titles.\n \n\n   \n  But even those stories did not begin a decade prior, stranded in the third tier and fighting bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t really compare because Leicester still had really wealthy owners,” Olof Lundh, a Swedish sports journalist, tells CNN Sports. “I have a hard time finding equivalent achievements, especially considering they’re from this really small municipality.\n \n\n   \n  “They shouldn’t even be in the top division,” he adds. “Just being in the top division is impressive, and being in the top half of the top division is super impressive and then winning the title, it’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The obvious question, then, is: how exactly did this happen? How is it possible for a team from a village approximately 1/250th the size of Malmö to fight off Sweden’s elite and have arguably the best season in the nation’s history?\n \n\n   \n  Under chairman Magnus Emeus, a local businessman who returned to his hometown after working abroad, Mjällby has followed a philosophy whereby “you’re supposed to be able to measure everything,” says Lundh.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’ve just been really smart and worked really hard,” adds Hadzic. “They’ve been tremendously good in their scouting. They’ve found some good players, they’re giving players a second chance and they’ve just blossomed at Mjällby.”\n \n\n   \n  And when your town is so small that everyone knows everyone else – Mjällby’s head coach is a school principal and its scout is a postman – your weaknesses can become your biggest strengths.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a team based on very high team spirit,” Hadzic explains. “Some of the players live in the same flat.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something I never thought would happen in my life. I’m so incredibly grateful for this group,” striker Jacob Bergstrom said Monday, according to Reuters. “We showed that a collective can take you incredibly far, we have a lot of players who give everything for Mjällby, it’s fantastic.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been here for eight years (in total) and I have my best friends playing here and it’s all just wonderful, so I’m grateful.”\n \n\n   \n  That spirit seeps out into the local community, too; the local florist recently  developed  its own chocolates to honor the club’s achievement.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, in sporting director Hasse Larsson, Mjällby has a man who has given decades of his life to the club.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s like the heart and soul of the club,” says Hadzic. “He’s been a player, a manager, and now he’s a sporting director. Somehow, his soul embodies the whole club. He’s willing to do so much for Mjällby and willing to work so hard for them.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, luck has played its part in Mjällby’s triumph. The club has taken advantage of several of the league’s biggest teams, including Malmö, underperforming and all beating each other, Lund pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  That hard work will most likely continue ahead of next season when, should it emerge from the qualifying stage, Mjällby would be taking on Europe’s elite in the  Champions League . The thought of the likes of  Real Madrid  or Liverpool making the journey to the edge of the Baltic Sea is one that the team’s fans would have laughed at just 12 months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I have a hard time putting it into words, I can honestly say. It’s so incredibly powerful,” Mjällby head coach Anders Torstensson said after Monday’s win, per Reuters. “Together with the team, we have kept it away from us, the pressure, the speculations and what is possible and not possible. It’s fantastic.\n \n\n   \n  “Redeeming to stand here as Swedish champions with little bloody Mjällby. It’s unreal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/lisbon-funicular-crash-faulty-cable-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"03:26:00-04:00","title":"Cable in deadly Portugal funicular crash failed to meet specifications, preliminary report finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fatal crash on Lisbon’s Glória funicular in September 2025 resulted in at least 16 deaths and multiple injuries when a steel cable snapped during operation.

through his livestreamed play and accessible teachings, has died at 29.\n \n\n   \n  The Charlotte Chess Center, a chess academy in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Naroditsky served as a head coach, announced his death in a  statement  on social media Monday. The announcement did not include a cause of death or say where he died.\n \n\n   \n  “It is with great sadness that we share the unexpected passing of Daniel Naroditsky. Daniel was a talented chess player, commentator, and educator, and a cherished member of the chess community. He was also a loving son, brother, and loyal friend to many,” the Charlotte Chess Center said in a statement attributed to Naroditsky’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Naroditsky began learning chess at age 6, starting a journey that would see him earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by the International Chess Federation to the world’s top players – before he was a senior in high school, according to the  center .\n \n\n   \n  His talent was evident early: he won grade-level national championships twice, and in fifth grade became the youngest player ever to claim the California K-12 Championship. That same year, in November 2007, he earned international acclaim as the under-12 World Youth Chess Champion, establishing himself as one of the country’s most promising young talents.\n \n\n   \n  After taking a gap year to focus fully on chess, Naroditsky enrolled at Stanford University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  The chess phenom also showed a spark for teaching the game.

But these warehouse-like facilities, containing computers that process and store data, require a lot of land and huge amounts of energy, generating significant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\n \n\n   \n  Data center power demand will increase 165% by 2030, according to  Goldman Sachs . Some data centers use renewables, and others are being constructed with  renewable energy generation on-site , but clean energy sources like solar and wind farms require physical space, as does data center infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Now, some are looking to put data centers into space, bypassing the problem of finding available land. Space also offers  better access to solar energy , without the cloud cover, the darkness of nighttime or the seasonality of Earth.\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, the ASCEND project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of space-based data centers for reducing CO2 emissions.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, France-based  Thales Alenia Space , which led a European Commission-funded  study  into the feasibility of ASCEND, found that sending data centers to space to take advantage of continuous solar energy could offer “a more eco-friendly and sovereign solution for hosting and processing data.” But that would be contingent on technological advancements in several areas, said Xavier Roser of Thales Alenia Space.\n \n\n   \n  While the total emissions from rocket launches are currently only a fraction of those from the aviation industry, rockets release pollutants at higher altitudes, where they last longer.\n \n\n   \n  The ASCEND study estimated that for space data centers to effectively reduce carbon emissions compared to their terrestrial counterparts would require the development of a launcher that emits 10 times less carbon over its lifecycle than current ones. It’s not clear when or if such a rocket may be in development. SpaceX, which has revolutionized the cost of rockets with its fleet of Falcon launch vehicles, has not revealed any plans to debut a more environmentally friendly rocket design.\n \n\n   \n    Small steps\n \n\n   \n  Abu Dhabi-based startup  Madari Space  has collaborated with an industrial accelerator program run by Thales Alenia Space, and is one of a handful of companies that are launching small computing components into orbit as technical demonstrations. \n \n\n   \n  Madari founder and CEO Shareef Al Romaithi, who is also a pilot for Etihad Airways, said space-based data centers could benefit a variety of customers, including those with Earth observation satellites. He said storing and processing their raw observation data in space can reduce lag time in anlayzing their findings, and “allow them to make informed decisions in a timely manner,”\n \n\n   \n  He hopes to eventually deploy a constellation of data satellites into orbit. While that goal is a way off, Madari’s first mission, scheduled for 2026, will send a payload about the size of a toaster oven — consisting of data storage and data processing components — into orbit aboard an Emirati satellite, part of the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)’s Access to Space for All Initiative.   \n \n\n   \n  Others have already carried out launches. In May, China launched  12 satellites  for a space-based computing constellation — the first of a proposed 2,800-satellite fleet to process data in space.\n \n\n   \n  Al Romaithi says that should be a wakeup call to consider space a viable location for data centers. “It is a reality that’s happening,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lonestar Data Holdings, a Florida-based firm, said in March that it  successfully tested  a small data center on the moon, despite the system  landing on its side and powering down early . \n \n\n   \n  In November, Starcloud — a Washington state-based startup — will launch a satellite equipped with a Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The company told CNN via email that it will set a record for the most powerful in-orbit compute power.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that in 10 years’ time, almost all new data centers will be being built in space, purely because of the constraints we are facing on building new energy projects terrestrially,” Philip Johnston, its CEO, said in the email. The main challenges to overcome first are dissipating large amounts of heat in a vacuum and making the chips work in a high radiation environment, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, it’s very early days for the sector — and a giant leap to launch data centers big enough to offer an alternative to those on Earth. Cost will be key, with launch costs dependent on the weight of the payload.\n \n\n   \n  Lonestar has signed a  $120 million deal with spacecraft provider Sidus  to build and provide on-orbit support for six data-storage satellites. It plans to launch the first in 2027 — a 15-petabyte system operating from the Earth-moon Lagrange point L1, some 60,000 kilometers from the moon. The next five satellites will each double in storage capacity, while keeping the same weight and energy requirements, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Each will share a ride with larger satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon, making up around 15% of the payload mass. That could cost in the region of $10 million per launch, for a fraction of the storage of many terrestrial data centers.\n \n\n   \n    Overcoming astronomical challenges\n \n\n   \n  But some experts are skeptical about the economics of data centers in space. “To do a cost effective, true, objective analysis of it, it doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny,” said  Quentin A. Parker , the director of the Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).  “The terrestrial solutions are still there, and they’re still probably a lot cheaper than trying to put anything into space,” he added. “Putting them into space has all sorts of problems associated with it.”\n \n\n   \n  While advocates claim that storing data in space could provide protection from data centers being attacked, or damaged due to natural disasters,   Parker points out that space brings its own risks, including radiation,  space debris , and also the consequences of sending more human-made objects into space without a solution for cleaning them up.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have been raising alarm bells about the increasing amount of human-made junk left in space; they warn that a collision could take down space-based technologies that power our everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  Others have pointed out that maintaining and repairing data centers in space could  pose a major challenge , while space weather, such as solar flares, could disrupt services. And a number of nations are  reportedly developing “counterspace technologies,”  such as jamming systems that can be targeted at satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Proponents of space-based data centers may be “overselling the advantages and significantly underselling the major drawbacks,” said Parker.\n \n\n   \n  But for Al Romaithi, looking off-planet is a necessity. “It is worth overcoming these challenges because the alternative is technological stagnation,” he said. “We will reach a point where we are exhausting our resources just to run data centers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/football-nfl-week-7-mnf-review-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:27:00-04:00","title":"Breakout RB display, another serious injury to a star and third-year receiver continues rise: NFL Week 7 MNF review","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season, the Detroit Lions defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24-9 in a dominant performance featuring a breakout game from running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who recorded 218 total yards and two touchdowns—his best of the season.

third-year receiver continues rise: NFL Week 7 MNF review \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:27 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the final time this NFL season, there was a double-header on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   \n   Week 7’s  two Monday games saw the Detroit Lions comfortably handle the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seahawks outlast the Houston Texans to provide a small salve to  Seattle sports fans .\n \n\n   \n  There were plenty of storylines to come from the two games, including a breakout performance for a star running back and another serious injury suffered by a big-time wide receiver.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two MNF games.\n \n\n   \n    Gibbs explodes as Lions dispatch Bucs\n \n\n   \n  Entering the 2025  NFL  season, Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs could claim he was the best at his position; he was tied for the most rushing touchdowns in the league last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  But through the first six weeks of the season, it had been fairly ho-hum by his lofty standards.\n \n\n   \n  Well, that all changed on Monday night when the 23-year-old exploded for 218 total yards – 136 on the ground on 17 attempts and 82 through the air on three catches – as well as two rushing touchdowns in Detroit’s 24-9 win over Tampa Bay.\n \n\n   \n  His 218 yards from scrimmage were the most in a single game for a Lions player since Hall of Fame receiver  Calvin Johnson  had 329 yards in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  “It was huge. You felt like this was coming,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said of Gibbs’ performance afterwards. “You felt like this has been building and as he gets in better shape and starts getting his feet under him and starts getting a feel of it – starts breaking some tackles.\n \n\n   \n  “Every week, you feel like it’s gotten closer and closer. Tonight was the night where he just busted one of these out of there and there’ll be no looking back. I think he’s just going to continue to do this.”\n \n\n   \n  From the opening quarter, Gibbs looked up for the challenge. He caught a 30-yard pass on the team’s opening possession and then broke a 78-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, showing the speed and elusiveness he’s become known for since being drafted out of Alabama in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Gibbs’ performance came at the perfect time for the Lions, with quarterback Jared Goff having an uncharacteristically sloppy game, throwing one interception and losing a fumble.\n \n\n   \n  “Those long ones are fun to watch,” Goff said of Gibbs’ 78-yard TD run. “I feel like I got the best seat in the house just to like see him hit the hole and then just like take off. I don’t know how many safeties in the league could catch him. So, as soon as he gets there, it’s over and he’s gone. … It’s pretty cool. He’s dang fast and it’s fun to watch.”\n \n\n   \n  It was Gibbs’ best outing of the season by far, having not surpassed 100 rushing yards or 110 scrimmage yards in the 2025 season.\n \n\n   \n  For Tampa Bay, it was a disappointing overall display after an excellent start to the season.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the defeat which sees them slip to 5-2, the main negative on the night was another serious injury suffered by the team’s star wide receiver Mike Evans.\n \n\n   \n  Evans, who was returning from three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, was carted off the field in the second quarter after his head hit the turf while trying to catch a pass.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old was quickly ruled out with a concussion and a shoulder injury, but after the game, Bucs head coach Todd Bowles announced that Evans had suffered a broken clavicle and would miss most of the remainder of the NFL season.\n \n\n   \n  It likely ends Evans’ run of 11-straight seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards and leaves Tampa Bay’s receiving core down to the bare bones. The team was already without veteran Chris Godwin due to a fibula injury and breakout rookie Emeka Egbuka has been dealing with a hamstring issue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never good to see one of your star players go down like that, especially with him just coming back and everybody excited to see him,” Bowles said. “So, it’s a blow and we’ve been holding down since he’s been gone and we just got to regroup and come back.”\n \n\n   \n    Jaxon Smith-Njigba shines as Seahawks beat Texans\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s other game was a tighter affair, with the Seahawks overcoming the Texans 27-19 at Lumen Field.\n \n\n   \n  The Seahawks had raced into a 14-0 first-quarter lead before a string of errors let Houston back into the game.\n \n\n   \n  Seattle receiver Cooper Kupp threw an interception, then the team had a field goal attempt blocked. Houston had two field goals in the meantime to make it 14-6 at the half.\n \n\n   \n  Three plays after the break, Texans QB CJ Stroud threw an interception to set up a quick Seahawks field goal before a sack, forced fumble and fumble return touchdown – all from Houston pass rusher Will Anderson – cut Seattle’s lead to five.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the Texans looking like they had the momentum, 10 straight points from the Seahawks put the home team back on top.\n \n\n   \n  And although Woody Marks’ touchdown run with just over two minutes to play made it a one-score game, an unnecessary roughness penalty by Houston’s Tim Settle meant the Seahawks could run out the rest of the clock and hold on to an important win and improve to 5-2 in a three-way tie for first in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n  In what was a defensive grind at times, the star of the show on offense was Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba who continued his excellent third season in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  The former Ohio State star finished the game with eight catches for 123 yards and a touchdown; he celebrated his score with an athletic basketball-esque dunk of the football over the goal posts for which he received a penalty.\n \n\n   \n  He now  leads the league  with 819 receiving yards and now has five games this season with over 100 receiving yards.\n \n\n   \n  Smith-Njigba has become the favorite target of Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold in his first year with the team and looks to be among the league’s best at his position.\n \n\n   \n  The Seahawks signal-caller was asked about how Smith-Njigba compares to Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson, who Darnold connected with so effectively last season.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re both really, really good players.

Here’s what she learned \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, Andi Babineau, Whitney Wild, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis still has questions.\n \n\n   \n  During a  hearing Monday , she pressed two federal officials over the response to ongoing and intense protests in Chicago amid Operation Midway Blitz, especially after she expanded her temporary restraining order to include having agents on the ground turn on their body worn cameras when encountering demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  She tried to get a better sense of which agency has responsibility over what, how her restraining order has been disseminated to federal agents working in Chicago, how extensive training on crowd control and protests have been and what happened at certain fraught encounters over the last few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the main takeaways from Monday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n    Judge wants body cameras on all officers at protests, not all have them\n \n\n   \n  Ellis early this month issued a  sweeping order  restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During a hearing  last week , she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, she added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls at them.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but her order does not require them if they are undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.\n \n\n   \n  Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said during Monday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  ICE’s Special Response Teams, however, have not been issued body cameras, ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified. They went to one or two field offices but stopped being issued, and would need to go through Congress to get approved, Byers said without elaborating.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents are trained on how to respond to protesters\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents have been trained on how to respond to demonstrations and how to arrest protesters as part of their use of force training, Byers said. They have the ability to issue felony and misdemeanor citations during demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  Members of ICE’s Special Response Team have been outside the Broadview detention facility, the center of many anti-immigration enforcement demonstrations monitoring protests, and Byers indicated they too, are extensively trained.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents are also specifically trained on how to handle reporters and direct press questions to public affairs. He added journalists have the right to observe, as long as they do not interfere.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as they’re in the media area, we shouldn’t have a problem with press,” Byers said.\n \n\n   \n  When questioned about an incident outside the Broadview facility in which a  pastor  said he was hit with pepper balls, Byers said the pastor did not leave federal property when given multiple commands to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Rev. David Black said he was outside the facility praying for the ICE officers and those detained inside when he was hit. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett on October 9 there was no warning before less-than-lethal force was used during the demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  “After they shot me in my head and my face, and multiple times in my torso, arms and legs, I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black said.\n \n\n   \n    Federal leadership’s a ‘revolving door,’ with multiple agencies on the ground\n \n\n   \n  Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE  deployment  across Chicagoland, yielding more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent  demonstration  in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration,  last week  said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n  When force is used during protests, reports are reviewed by ICE leadership, the Office of Professional Responsibility and a review committee to determine if the use of force meets policy, Byers said.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s Special Response Team falls under the same enforcement mission as ICE, but members report directly to Byers, he said, adding ICE leadership has been “kind of a revolving door.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvick and Byers testified Monday after Russell Hott, the former interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, had left the Chicago area to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis will continue to question top brass at a later time after saying Monday she will still depose Hott and Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent at CBP.\n \n\n   \n  She added since Hott was the highest officer in Chicago at the time the protests occurred, he should be able to speak to what happened on the ground.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/trump-legal-victory-troops-portland-wwk-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"04:06:00-04:00","title":"Trump Scores Legal Victory Over National Guard Troop Deployment to Portland","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration achieved a legal victory by having a federal appeals court overturn a lower court order blocking the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to Portland, asserting that the President lawfully exercised his authority.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:06 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been given the green light to send the Oregon National Guard into Portland after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court’s order to bar the deployment – but there’s at least one more legal hurdle to clear before there will be boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority,” the 2-1  ruling  from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Monday said.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, supported by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, overturns a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week extended two orders blocking the mobilization of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  It also marks a big win for the administration as it continues to battle other Democrat-led cities over troop deployment – efforts that local and state leaders say are a disproportionate response to protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what else we know:\n \n\n   \n    When will troops be deployed?\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns only one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, and because a second decision is still in force, troops can’t immediately be mobilized.\n \n\n   \n  The second restraining order blocks the administration from mobilizing National Guard troops from anywhere in the US in Oregon. The administration argued in a Monday evening filing the second order should also be overruled given both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle over Oregon continues, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  news conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, it is unclear when troops would be deployed or how many would be federalized, Kotek said, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Will the state or city appeal?\n \n\n   \n  The sole dissenting vote on the three-judge appellate panel came from Judge Susan P. Graber, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions,” Graber wrote in her dissent.\n \n\n   \n  Echoing Graber’s sentiments, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement, “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the Ninth Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an “en banc” review, in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.   \n \n\n   \n  Separately, a Ninth Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. ﻿While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday to make their arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Portland against White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have characterized Oregon’s biggest city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, which Kotek and other leaders in Oregon have  emphatically disputed . Kotek on Monday said in court that the situation in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were dangerous, unconstitutional, and also “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for other states\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s success in Oregon comes on the same day officials from Illinois and the city of Chicago asked the US Supreme Court to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state.\n \n\n   \n  The filing notes there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, as “small,” manageable by local authorities and having “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops takeover, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Monday filing comes after Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago in an emergency appeal against a lower court order that blocked the deployment of troops in the city. That temporary restraining order is set to expire on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, the administration argues “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, a group of seven elected officials sued the governor and the state’s attorney general last week for allowing the deployment of Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Governor Lee’s office responded Monday to the lawsuit filed against him, saying Lee has the authority to deploy the state’s Guard troops under Tennessee law,  CNN affiliate WATN  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  And for the second time in a week, Trump said on Sunday he would send the National Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that the city “went wrong, went woke.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to Trump’s comments, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a  video address  that sending the National Guard would not help with the city’s ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers – and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  While welcoming stronger coordination with federal authorities, Laurie cited declines in violent crime rate reaching “levels not seen since the 1950s” and record low tent camps to show the city achieving safety “without compromising on our values or our laws.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom also said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/middleeast/hamas-gaza-hostage-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00.000-04:00","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Deceased Hostage as Sergeant Major Tal Haimi","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli forensics have identified the body of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, a 41-year-old Israeli soldier killed during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, as the 13th deceased hostage returned under the US-proposed ceasefire agreement.

Yosef, Tal Shalev, Dana Karni, Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli forensics examiners have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage handed over on Monday as those of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Haimi was killed in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, while defending a kibbutz, the Israel Defense Forces said. He was 41 years old at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, four children, father and sister, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  Haimi is the 13th deceased hostage to be transferred and identified since the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal was signed on October 9.  Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri  was the previous one to be identified on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the ceasefire agreement, 15 more deceased hostages remain to be transferred by Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed condolences to Haimi’s family after his body was returned for a proper burial.\n \n\n   \n  “Alongside the profound grief and the understanding that their hearts will never be whole again, Tal’s return brings a measure of solace to a family that has lived in unbearable uncertainty and anguish for more than two years,” the group said.\n \n\n   \n  A coffin   carrying Haimi’s remains had arrived in Tel Aviv earlier Monday for identification after it was retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza and then transferred into the custody of Israeli forces in the war-torn territory. The latest transfer comes amid diplomatic efforts in the region aimed at pushing forward the next phase of the Trump administration’s ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF called on Hamas to “take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect.  Israeli intelligence  has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are  needed to recover the bodies  in Gaza after two years of war caused significant destruction in the territory.\n \n\n   \n  One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the ceasefire agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest news comes after the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza appears to have survived its first major test over the weekend – with both Hamas and the Israeli military accusing the other of violations – and amid anxiety in Israel over the delayed release of deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana said Monday that the ceasefire agreement, including the return of all deceased hostages, must be fulfilled “one way or another,” according to a Knesset spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n    Diplomatic push continues\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the Trump administration’s ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump threatened to “eradicate” Hamas if it doesn’t abide by the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have to, they’ll be eradicated, and they know that,” Trump said, warning that if the violence in Gaza continues, “we’re going to go in and straighten it out, and it’ll happen very quickly and pretty violently.”\n \n\n   \n  US troops would not be involved in any renewed fighting, Trump said, insisting that other forces are in place and ready to carry out orders should he decide that Hamas has violated the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire deal’s key architects, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner held lengthy meetings with senior IDF generals in Tel Aviv on Monday to discuss ceasefire arrangements in Gaza, an Israeli source with knowledge on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The source said the meetings took place in the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, during which Witkoff and Kushner met with the IDF’s head of Intelligence Directorate, Major General Shlomi Binder, and the head of the Planning Directorate, Major General Eyal Harel.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer and the Prime Minister’s military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, also participated, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/france-louvre-heist-worrying-escalation-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00+00:00","title":"Museum heists have changed.

changed. Why the Louvre robbery is a worrying escalation \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, Caitlin Danaher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:06 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paris’ Louvre Museum had already been open for 30 minutes, and welcomed hundreds of visitors through its doors, when thieves in yellow vests scaled a truck-mounted ladder to the second-floor balcony of the Apollo Gallery, home to the French crown jewels, among other treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Using an angle grinder to force open a window, they took just four minutes to enter the room, cut open two cases displaying Napoleonic jewels,  grab nine pieces  and flee back down the ladder.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond its seemingly cinematic plot, the robbery was a clear example of how thieves have started targeting cultural institutions not necessarily for their prized paintings, but for artifacts that can be dismantled, stripped or melted down for their expensive parts.\n \n\n   \n  Thieves executed a similarly daring raid on Dresden’s historic Green Vault in 2019, smashing their way into a glass case with an ax and making off with 21 diamond-studded Saxon treasures worth at least €113 million ($128 million).\n \n\n   \n  Many of the treasures  were recovered years later  when five men were convicted of the crime, but some remain missing to this day. All five told investigators they didn’t know where the missing jewels were.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve definitely seen in the last five to seven years is some more shift towards raw materials theft,” explained Remigiusz Plath, the secretary of the International Counsel of Museum Security, part of the International Counsel of Museums, whose experts keep information flowing across the European museum sector on security threats and best practices to safeguard institutions.\n \n\n   \n  The move, Plath says, has been away from stealing art for its cultural value. Works by Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian or Willem de Kooning can resurface years, or decades, later in a  building’s basement  or behind an  unassuming bedroom door . But experts say jewelry, coins or medals, meanwhile, are at risk of being lost forever — and quickly.\n \n\n   \n  “My cynical belief is that these gems from the Louvre have most likely already been broken down for their parts,” said Laura Evans, an art crime historian, author and professor.\n \n\n   \n  Her view is  shared by other experts  who have spoken to CNN about the case. “I don’t think that thieves probably care about the historical, cultural, or emotional significance of these gems as they were, and would not blink at cutting them down into different shapes and sizes. There’s a high liquidity when those gems are dismantled, but a stolen Monet, for example, has a really low liquidity, because it’s instantly recognizable.”\n \n\n   \n  Plath called museums “a relatively soft target” compared to other highly secured buildings, such as banks. Museums have to balance security with the freedom to see and engage with their collections.  “You can actually go in there, when the museum is open, and see it right in front of you,” he said. “And if you apply blunt force, just like a roof, you’re right there — there are not many thresholds to go through to have access to these raw materials.”\n \n\n   \n    A change in tactics\n \n\n   \n  Some of the most notorious museum robberies have captured the public imagination for their ingenuity or boldness. In 1990, at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, two men dressed as police officers pulled off the largest art heist in history, with 13 artworks, including three Rembrandts, and a Vermeer, that have never been found. In 1911, the Mona Lisa skyrocketed to international fame when a worker from the Louvre hid the small Leonardo da Vinci painting in his coat and spirited it away for two years.\n \n\n   \n  As the details of the Louvre heist have emerged, the plan’s sophistication has crystallized.  Like the highly orchestrated Green Vault heist, Evans called the Louvre incident a case of “cultural terrorism, executed with this military-style precision.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not about exploiting the weakest link anymore,” she said. “It’s about using force.”\n \n\n   \n  Police were met with several pieces of evidence when they arrived at the Louvre. Discarded by the truck were two grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, and a blanket. Laying nearby was a more eye-catching item, the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, dropped by the thieves as they made their escape on Yamaha T-Max scooters along the Seine river.\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Plath is concerned with what he believes are increasingly aggressive “grab-and-go” thefts as thieves gain access to buildings with powerful industrial tools — this time, shockingly, during the day, when the museum was already filled with visitors.\n \n\n   \n  Museum robberies more often happen after hours with fewer risks to bystanders. Evans pointed to a rare case in 1972 when two men shot a security guard at the Worcester Art Museum while fleeing with four paintings that were later recovered. But the theft at the Louvre gives her a greater sense of unease that the danger could be escalating.\n \n\n   \n  “With how these things are progressing, it’s probably only a matter of time before something like that happens again. That’s something that I definitely am worried about,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    An investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  With a national manhunt underway, questions are now being asked as to how the thieves managed to pull off such a feat, who they are, and why French institutions seem to be considered easy targets.\n \n\n   \n  Before the Louvre robbery, thieves targeted Paris’ Natural History Museum in September, stealing gold nuggets worth €600,000 ($699,000), as well as antique Chinese porcelain worth €9.5 million ($11 million) from a museum in Limoges, south of the capital, the same month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an investigator for France, you are working under the theory at this stage that these are related because of the frequency, the boldness, the similarities in their mode,” theorized CNN’s senior national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem.\n \n\n   \n  Plath, too, said they could be connected, or copycats who have observed the effectiveness of other heists. Natalie Goulet, a centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that the robbery was probably linked to organized crime. In the case of the 2019 Green Vault robbery, the five men convicted were part of the Remmo clan, one of Germany’s most powerful crime families, which operates mostly in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  French authorities will lead the investigation, though Interpol’s dedicated Cultural Heritage Crime unit may become involved if French officials suspect there is an international component.  Interpol  confirmed on X  that the Napoleonic crown jewels have been added to its database for stolen artworks and artifacts.\n \n\n   \n  For French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, the heist spotlights embarrassing security failings at one of France’s most venerable institutions. “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he told France Inter radio.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road… What is certain is that we have failed,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Evans said that though many will be drawn to the salacious details of the heist — like any riveting crime thriller — there is a deep sense of national loss that should not be forgotten.\n \n\n   \n  “I would encourage people to see beyond the sensationalism of the heist and how it was executed,” she said. “There’s a real hole in the cultural heritage and the history of France as a nation.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/trump-zelensky-meeting-territorial-concessions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"21:44:00-04:00","title":"How Trump-Zelensky meeting turned acrimonious over demands for territorial concessions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turned acrimonious as Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, demanding land give-ups—particularly in the strategically vital Donbas region—during a working lunch.

 9:44 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  working lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday turned acrimonious when the US leader insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, according to European officials briefed on the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who would later  endorse a freeze in current battle lines  as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The episode was the latest chapter in the fraught relationship between the two men, and amounted to another shift in Trump’s approach to how the war will be settled. Last month, after meeting Zelensky in New York, Trump claimed Ukraine might be able to regain all its territory lost to Russia. But now Trump is preparing for another high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  It was after a call with the Russian leader on the eve of the Zelensky meeting that Trump again insisted Kyiv must give up swaths of land for the conflict to end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump shrugged off the apparent reversal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I never said they would win it. I said they could win,” he said of Ukraine at the White House, where he was meeting the prime minister of Australia. “Anything could happen. You know, war is a very strange thing. A lot of bad things happen. A lot of good things happen.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he still believed Ukraine could win, but that he didn’t think it would.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky emerged from that meeting to brief European leaders on a call in which he sounded pessimistic about Trump’s position, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source separately called the White House meeting “tense,” but said there was “no shouting,” downplaying reports of a volatile encounter between the two leaders. Overall, the source called the meeting constructive, since Trump ultimately declared that a ceasefire be along the current frontline. Zelensky later endorsed the idea in remarks to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the European characterization of the meeting, the White House pointed to comments Trump made Sunday on Air Force One. “We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle lines,” he said. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that.’”\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, ending the Russia-Ukraine war is now a top priority after he brokered a truce between Israel and Hamas to end the conflict in Gaza. He emphasized the need to end the war quickly in Friday’s talks, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In his phone call with Trump a day earlier, Putin proposed a plan where Ukraine would surrender the eastern Donbas region in exchange for some Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the European official said.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal, which the officials characterized as a slightly less sweeping demand than what Putin raised during his August summit with Trump in Alaska, would still amount to a major loss of territory for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later arrived at the position of ending the war along the current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Sunday denied he asked Zelensky to concede the entire Donbas region, which Ukraine views as strategically important.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,” he said on Air Force One. “They should stop right now at the battle lines. … Go home, stop killing people and be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump told reporters he had asked Putin during their phone call to stop attacks on civilian areas but went on to talk about how many soldiers are dying.\n \n\n   \n  Several people familiar had previously told CNN that last week’s Trump-Zelensky meeting was tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” with the two leaders split over the future of the war.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the  long-range missiles that can reach far into Russia  that he was seeking. One US official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna on Monday disputed that the meeting was “aggressive” or “negative,” saying that it was “a dialogue” on ending the war. She said Trump and Zelensky left their meeting Friday with “full clarity” on “next steps.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the European officials, Zelensky and his delegation came to the White House with maps showing current battle lines, hoping to convince the US president to maintain and expand American support. Trump seemed uninterested in the arguments, and forcefully insisted Ukraine agree to land concessions for the war to end, they said.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview taped last week, Trump said for the war to end, Putin was “going to take something, he’s won certain property.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has told those around him that his demand for a ceasefire along current battle lines was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Both sides need to make a deal,” another US   official said arguing the conditions are only going to get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cast the meeting as a “pointed conversation” in a post to social media but said its outcome “can really help bring this war closer to an end.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional comments from President Donald Trump. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes, Victoria Butenko and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/10/asia/japan-takaichi-ldp-leader-hnk-intl-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-04:00","title":"Japan’s new leader drums to relieve stress.

She has many reasons to reach for her sticks \n       \n  By Hanako Montgomery, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:17 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For most of her life, Sanae Takaichi has loved heavy metal.\n \n\n   \n  Since drumming in a college band, the 64-year-old politician has remained a fan of groups like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. She used to play so hard that she carried four pairs of sticks as back-up in case they snapped, Japanese media has reported.\n \n\n   \n  But unlike most metalheads who mellow with age, Japan’s newly elected prime minister is still an enthusiast. She has an electric drum set at home and bangs out songs whenever she’s stressed, usually about her husband.\n \n\n   \n  “I play after he goes to sleep,” she joked during a recent interview with a Japanese YouTuber.\n \n\n   \n  That same headbanging energy has defined her steady, albeit unconventional, political rise.\n \n\n   \n  The staunch conservative and longtime lawmaker won Japan’s ruling party’s presidency  on October 4 , becoming the first woman ever to secure the post, after her third attempt. On Thursday, Japan’s parliament elected her prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  As Japan’s first woman prime minister, she will inherit a daunting list of challenges.\n \n\n   \n    Aspirations of ‘Japan’s Thatcher’\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has long championed conservative policies, rooted in nationalist and traditionalist ideals. Her win, a surprising triumph in Japan’s deeply patriarchal political system, signals to disillusioned LDP voters that traditional conservatism is alive and well.\n \n\n   \n  A prominent member of the ultranationalist lobby group Nippon Kaigi, she promotes a patriotic education. She’s also supported revising Japan’s pacifist constitution, particularly Article 9, which renounces war and bans military forces.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara prefecture to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator, “wearing miniskirts, riding motorcycles and presenting herself in a lively, unconventional way that sharply contrasted with the typical older male commentators,” Hajime Kidera, a professor at Meiji University’s School of Political Science and Economics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Takaichi gave up her beloved Kawasaki Z400GP motorcycle after becoming a lawmaker in 1993 at age 32, reportedly to avoid accidents that could hinder her work.\n \n\n   \n  Her first stint in politics was as an independent lawmaker in Japan’s parliament. Around that time, she met the hairdresser who’d style her hair for the next three decades. From the start, Yukitoshi Arai told CNN, Takaichi aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher.\n \n\n   \n  When Arai learned Takaichi had won the LDP leadership, he said, “I was so happy it gave me goosebumps.”\n \n\n   \n  He fondly recalled how, after early political struggles, Takaichi joined the LDP in 1996. “We decided to express her renewed determination with her hair and cut it short,” he said. Thus was born the iconic “Sanae cut” – sleek, sharp and practical for a busy politician.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the LDP, Takaichi has been re-elected nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi married in 2004. In a recent interview, she said she agreed to marry her husband, a fellow LDP lawmaker, without ever going on a date.\n \n\n   \n  He proposed over the phone, saying he’d had his eyes on her “for some time.” His audacity and her rashness might surprise some. But her husband was a catch, she said – he’s a trained chef.\n \n\n   \n  “He told me, ‘You’ll never go a day without eating good food.’ So, I just took the plunge,” she laughed, admitting she’s not much of a cook herself.\n \n\n   \n    New leader faces challenges\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s economic and demographic woes pose immediate challenges for Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s declining birthrate means a shrinking workforce saddled with supporting a swelling elderly population. Record high inflation and a weak yen are also squeezing households and driving up living costs.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after her election as LDP leader, the yen hit a new low amid expectations of major fiscal stimulus. Takaichi has floated large-scale spending and low inflation under her own banner, “Sanaenomics,” echoing her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.”\n \n\n   \n  “That kind of talk can weaken the yen further and raise concerns about Japan’s debt levels. For ordinary people already struggling with rising prices, it’s also a serious worry,” Kidera, the politics professor from Meiji University, said.\n \n\n   \n  Trade relations with Washington could prove tricky, particularly over a  $550 billion Japan-to-US investment deal  announced in September, which Takaichi has previously said she could revisit.\n \n\n   \n  As it stands, Japan’s investment in the US targets sectors like semiconductors, energy, pharmaceuticals and shipbuilding, while also purchasing $8 billion annually in US agricultural products. In return, the US has reduced tariffs on Japanese goods, including cars, to a baseline of 15%.\n \n\n   \n  With few details about the $550 billion investment deal available, and given President Donald Trump’s mercurial nature, Takaichi appears to be waiting to see how it unfolds, said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm.\n \n\n   \n  Her first test with Washington could come quickly – she could meet Trump just days into her premiership.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her short runway, comparisons between the two conservative leaders are already being drawn. As a protégé of Abe, who enjoyed a close rapport with Trump, Takaichi is expected to follow her mentor’s diplomatic playbook. Like Abe, Takaichi has called for sharp increases in Japan’s defense budget, a move likely to be welcomed by the Trump administration, which has urged Tokyo to approach NATO’s 5% benchmark.\n \n\n   \n  Geopolitics will further test her leadership. Known as a China hawk, Takaichi has previously suggested that Chinese residents in Japan have a “duty to aid Chinese espionage.” She’s also argued that Japanese war crimes have been exaggerated, and makes regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan’s war dead, including convicted war criminals, are enshrined. Several of her cabinet picks have close ties to Taiwan, risking friction with Beijing, Japan’s top trading partner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet analysts expect her stance on visits to the Yasukuni shrine will soften in office. “In reality, Takaichi will likely follow a logic of practical diplomacy. She’ll have to tone down the anti-China rhetoric she’s shown in the past,” political analyst Nishimura told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Signs of moderation have already appeared. Takaichi said she won’t visit Yasukuni during its autumn festival, likely to reassure uneasy coalition partners.\n \n\n   \n  Her election may also blunt the rise of  Sanseito, a right-wing populist party  that surged in July on an anti-immigration platform. During the LDP leadership race, all five candidates promised tougher measures on foreigners. But Takaichi stood out for her rhetoric, vowing to crack down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  She also cited unconfirmed anecdotes about tourists allegedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara, remarks that drew criticism. She later clarified she aimed to highlight the growing anxiety and anger among many Japanese about “outrageous” foreigners.\n \n\n   \n  At home, Takaichi must rebuild public trust after years of scandal within her party. In 2022, revelations of some LDP lawmakers’ ties to the former Unification Church hurt the party’s reputation. The following year, several lawmakers were accused of failing to report income or disclose kickbacks, deepening public frustration.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say Takaichi’s record on women’s rights is mixed and will be another test of her public appeal. She opposes allowing married women to keep separate surnames, and resists  female succession in the imperial family.  Still, during her 2025 campaign, she proposed tax breaks for babysitting and corporate incentives for in-house childcare, perhaps signs of a cautious shift toward more women-friendly policies.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s rise delivers a jolt to Japan’s political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether Takaichi’s election, and the LDP’s gamble on her, will revive the party’s fortunes or hasten its decline.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/kada-scott-update-remains-identified","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00.000Z","title":"Remains found behind abandoned school belong to missing Philadelphia woman, Kada Scott, officials say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman missing for about two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Remains found buried in a wooded area behind an abandoned school are those of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman who had been  missing  for about two weeks, prosecutors in Philadelphia said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities said an anonymous tip led police back to the area they previously searched and they found the remains in a shallow grave. DNA tests confirmed her identity.\n \n\n   \n  Keon King, 21, of Dover, Delaware, has been arrested and charged with  kidnapping , stalking and other charges in Scott’s disappearance. Bail was set at $2.5 million. Prosecutors say more charges are in the works. A message seeking comment was left Monday for King’s defense lawyer, Shaka Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  “I am confident that homicide charges will be brought,” District Attorney Larry Krasner said at a news conference. “But I also have an obligation to follow the law and uphold the constitution. That means we don’t take shortcuts.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say King and Scott had cellphone contact and that a stolen vehicle found on fire was used by King. His cellphone was in locations related to her disappearance, prosecutor Ashley Toczylowski told reporters. She said there is extensive video evidence in the case.\n \n\n   \n  Toczylowski said an initial tip last week led investigators to the school but they did not find Scott’s remains, but a new and more specific tip this weekend to “go back, she’s there, look again” led them to Scott.\n \n\n   \n  She said authorities “have reason to believe other people may have been involved after the fact,” calling that a matter “very much still being investigated.”\n \n\n   \n  Additional charges related to the stolen vehicle fire were filed against King, including arson, causing or risking a catastrophe and conspiracy. Krasner’s office said in a news release that the black Hyundai Accent had been reported stolen a day before Scott disappeared on Oct. 4. The car was seen on video parked at a recreation center during the late evening of Oct. 4, near where Scott’s body was found.\n \n\n   \n  Three days later, the Hyundai was reported to be on fire in Philadelphia but it was compacted at a junkyard before investigators could examine it.\n \n\n   \n  King was arrested earlier this year in another case but posted $200,000 bail and was released. In the previous case, prosecutors said, King was accused of kidnapping a woman from in front of her house and forcing her into a car where she was assaulted and eventually let go. Those charges were dropped when the victim and a witness did not appear for court proceedings, Krasner said.\n \n\n   \n  Scott, who worked in an assisted living facility, was remembered Monday in a statement by her parents as a source of “light, kindness and beautiful spirit.” They said their hearts were “shattered” and asked for prayers.

Karina Tsui, Amanda Musa, Andy Rose, Danya Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:13 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Monday will allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland — an important legal victory in a showdown over presidential power that’s happening on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment as the appeal process plays out, but because the second decision is still in force, the troops can’t immediately be deployed.\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel weighed in on a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week  ruled to extend  two temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  In light of the appellate court’s ruling, the Trump administration is asking that Judge Immergut’s second order be thrown out or paused, arguing in a Monday evening filing that both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s success in Oregon comes days after he urged the Supreme Court to allow him to  deploy the National Guard in Chicago  in an emergency appeal of a lower court order that the administration said “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump exaggerates the severity of Portland’s protests on social media, “this does not change that other facts provide a colorable basis to support the statutory requirements,” the majority said in the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Two Trump-appointed judges, Ryan D. Nelson and Bridget S. Bade, sided with the administration’s appeal while a third, former President Bill Clinton appointee Judge Susan P. Graber, dissented, saying, “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s ruling, from the White House’s point of view, proves the lower court’s decision was incorrect, according to Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  The president has cited  protests outside  Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the call-ups of troops in the deep blue city.   \n \n\n   \n  “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a  statement  Monday. “We are on a dangerous path in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the Ninth Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an en banc review in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a Ninth Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. ﻿While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  The state plans to file its own petition for an en banc review, a spokeswoman for the Rayfield’s office said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday, October 22, to make their case for or against an en banc review.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m very troubled’\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle in Oregon wages on, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  virtual press conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  Kotek echoed the sentiments in Judge Graber’s dissent and asked that the Ninth Circuit review the case again given the seriousness of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a really important development that the one judge in the 2-1 ruling was immediately calling on their on her colleagues, to vacate this order,” Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, Kotek added, it is unclear where troops would be deployed or how many would federalized, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Kotek, along with other leaders in Oregon, has  emphatically disputed  the president’s characterizations of the city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Oregon’s biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were “fundamentally un-Constitutional, dangerous for American civil rights” and risk “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as   President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco as his administration continues an effort to crackdown on a growing list of cities it claims to be ridden with crime.\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago it went wrong, it went woke,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The president told Bartiromo the cities he feels are in need of troop deployment are almost exclusively “Democrat-run,” describing them as “unsafe” and “a disaster.” Trump also claimed he could, at any moment, invoke the  Insurrection Act  – a seldom-used law that allows the president to deploy military forces in the US in certain limited situations.\n \n\n   \n  The mobilization of National Guard troops to cities like Chicago; Memphis, Tennessee; and Portland, Oregon, has been met with fierce backlash from residents as well as local and state leaders – including some who have gone so far as to sue the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Federal deployments have also sparked pop-up protests in these cities and helped fuel a second  “No Kings” rally  over the weekend, where millions took part in more than 2,700 events across the country to protest the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the latest on Trump’s efforts to federalize troops in several US cities:\n \n\n   \n    San Francisco\n \n\n   \n  Trump toyed with the idea of deploying federal troops to the Bay Area last week when he told FBI Director Kash Patel that San Francisco was among the “great cities that can be fixed.”\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets,” California state Senator Scott Wiener, whose district includes San Francisco,  said on X . “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: Stay the hell out of San Francisco.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump initially received support from Bay area tech billionaire and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who told the New York Times ahead of his “Dreamforce” AI conference last week, he backed Trump’s troop deployment to the city. But Benioff later backtracked,  saying on X  he does not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco and his comments were made out of “an abundance of caution around the event.”\n \n\n   \n  “I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has not directly commented on Trump’s comments, but said in a news conference last Friday crime in the city is  down 30%  – the lowest point in decades.\n \n\n   \n  The city has faced a shortage of police officers but recently reported its largest surge of recruits in years, according to the  San Francisco Police Department , with 3,375 entry-level applications so far this year, up more than 40% from last year.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Newsom  sued the Trump administration  in June over the federalization of the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles and joined a  lawsuit in Oregon  earlier this month over Trump’s attempt to send federalized troops in Los Angeles to Portland to respond to protests there.\n \n\n   \n    Memphis\n \n\n   \n  A group of seven elected officials in Tennessee filed a lawsuit against the state’s governor and attorney general last week, challenging the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Memphis  Mayor Paul Young,  defended the city, noting crime has fallen by double-digit percentages since last year, but acknowledged the situation is different from efforts to fight the federalization of troops in Portland or Chicago,  CNN affiliate WMC  reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Memphis is different than L.A. and Chicago or Portland in that the governor of Tennessee and the president of the United States made the decision to bring the National Guard and the federal resources to the City of Memphis,”  Young said Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said last week she hoped troops would help direct traffic and have a presence in public retail spaces, but not operate at checkpoints, the AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “From a public safety standpoint, we’re trying to utilize Guard personnel in non-enforcement types of capacities, so it does not feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities, in our neighborhoods, and that’s not where we’re directing those resources, either,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago in a court filing Monday asked the US Supreme Court to block the Trump administration emergency request to keep National Guard troops in the state to help combat protests and perceived crime despite objections from local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a district court issued a temporary restraining order against the federalization and deployment of troops in the city. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit partially stayed that ruling, allowing federalization but not deployment. The temporary restraining order expires Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether to allow the deployment while the legal battle continues.\n \n\n   \n  The filing says there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing that the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview as “small” and manageable by local authorities and saying they “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops take over, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s appeal of the temporary restraining order ,  the administration said the lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal describes the situation in Chicago as threatening, asserting that federal officials there have been “assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Chicago became the focus of courtroom discussions last week with a judge  demanding answers  from federal authorities over violent encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis said recent news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration was not following her instructions to limit use of force and actions against journalists documenting Chicago protests.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week expanded her restraining order, requiring all federal agents with body cameras involved in quelling protests to have them on when encountering demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Her order, however, does not require agents to wear body cameras if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Department of Homeland Security policy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/paul-ingrassia-senate-confirmation-concerns","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-04:00","title":"‘He’s not going to pass’: Thune says controversial Trump nominee for whistleblower office won’t be confirmed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a nominee for the Office of Special Counsel, faces a likely confirmation defeat after allegations surfaced of racist text messages in which he referred to Martin Luther King Jr. Day as being 'tossed into the seventh circle of hell' and claimed he has a 'Nazi streak.'

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:55 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Paul Ingrassia’s  nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel is dead on arrival in the Senate, per Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who declared Monday night that “he’s not going to pass” after Politico  reported   on racist text messages allegedly sent by Ingrassia to a group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia is set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and at least one Republican senator on the panel is already planning to vote against advancing Ingrassia’s nomination.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. If every Democrat on the committee opposes Ingrassia, and Scott joins them, that would be enough to block the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the White House should pull Ingrassia’s nomination, Thune told reporters, “I hope so,” and chuckled before adding, “He’s not going to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump nominated Ingrassia in May to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s  KFile   has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, as well his claims that straight White men are the most intelligent demographic group.\n \n\n   \n  His nomination has drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia has also been scrutinized for his ties to  Nick Fuentes , a noted White nationalist and Holocaust denier, as well as his defense of Fuentes’ ability to post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Homeland Security Chairman Rand Paul would not say if he’d oppose Ingrassia, but he noted that the administration will have to decide if it is comfortable with Ingrassia’s nomination moving forward.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that ultimately, there are a lot of questions on the nomination that the White House has to make a determination whether they think his nomination can get through, and we’re going to wait and hear from them what their thoughts are, whether they’ve talked to all the Republican members, and whether they think they have the votes,” Paul told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Other GOP senators refused to say if they’d back Ingrassia and said they want to hear from him on Thursday. “It sounds like there’s new information out tonight, I haven’t seen,” said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. “I’m sure we will welcome the opportunity to have his hearing on Thursday and respond to folks’ questions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added that he hasn’t “delved into it yet,” but he imagined they’d learn more on Thursday, and Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said he’d like to speak with Ingrassia again, noting there are “plenty of questions” after the text messages came to light. “I want to be able to talk to him about it.”\n \n\n   \n  The text messages in question, obtained by Politico, allegedly included Ingrassia saying he has “a Nazi streak,” and arguing that Martin Luther King Jr. Day “should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, wouldn’t confirm to Politico if the texts were authentic and suggested the messages were “making fun” of liberals.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted.

Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Utah judge on Monday sentenced a man who appeared to  fake his death and flee  the United States to avoid arrest on rape charges to anywhere from five years to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas Rossi, 38, is “a serial abuser of women” and “the very definition of a flight risk,” District Judge Barry Lawrence said before handing down the sentence.\n \n\n   \n  It was Rossi’s first of two sentencings after separate convictions in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November in the second case.\n \n\n   \n  Utah allows prison sentences to be given as a range rather than a set period of time. A parole board will determine if and when Rossi is released. Five years to life is the entire range of possible prison time under Utah law for rape, a first-degree felony.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a  three-day trial  in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi left a “trail of fear, pain and destruction” behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a plea for vengeance,” she said. “This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi posed a risk to community safety and should be in prison, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, before the sentencing. Rossi’s lawyers, meanwhile, urged the judge to give him parole.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi did not testify on his own behalf during the trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, he maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,” Rossi said in a soft, raspy voice. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and used an oxygen tank.\n \n\n   \n  Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to  clear its rape kit backlog .\n \n\n   \n  Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on February 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  He was  arrested in Scotland  the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos – including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended – from an Interpol notice.\n \n\n   \n  He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\n \n\n   \n  In his first trial, Rossi’s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. Even so, the jury convicted Rossi of the rape charge for which he was sentenced Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in the case had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.\n \n\n   \n  She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn’t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.\n \n\n   \n  She went to police years later, after hearing that Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi was convicted in that case in September and sentencing is set for November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/tylenol-fda-label-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:49:00Z","title":"Tylenol’s maker pushes back against possible label change linking pain reliever’s use in pregnancy to autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing proposed changes to the safety label of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) that would link its use during pregnancy to increased risks of autism or ADHD in children.

Other common pain or fever treatments like  ibuprofen  or  regular-dose aspirin  can increase the risk of serious complications when used during pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n   Untreated  pain or fever can be dangerous for the mother and the fetus, possibly leading to problems like miscarriage, birth defects or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Beginning the process  to change the safety label on acetaminophen products was just one action the Trump administration planned to take.\n \n\n   \n  US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the news conference last month that his agency would launch a public service campaign about the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The  FDA also sent a letter  to physicians saying that the choice to take Tylenol “still belongs with parents” but that use during pregnancy may cause an “increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the letter also noted that “a causal relationship has not been established” and that studies about a link are “contradictory.”\n \n\n   \n  The Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine nonprofit with close ties Kennedy,  said in a letter  dated the day of Trump’s news conference that it had filed a  citizen’s petition  with the FDA. Such filings are a way for individuals, industry or consumer groups to ask the agency to take action on a specific issue.\n \n\n   \n  The petition says that because of the “urgent public health implications,” the FDA should act quickly to add a more detailed warning to the labels of over-the-counter drug products that contain acetaminophen to spell out that “studies show that frequent use of this product during pregnancy may increase your child’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Kenvue asked the FDA to deny the petition, saying that suggested changes to the label are unsupported by scientific evidence “and would represent an unexplained departure from FDA’s longstanding position on acetaminophen during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  The company said it met with Kennedy in early September, after the HHS secretary reached out to say he believed there was a connection between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, and it told him there was no such link.\n \n\n   \n  An HHS spokesperson said Monday that the FDA doesn’t comment on product-specific matters.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA  website on acetaminophen  has not changed to reflect the Trump administration’s views. It says it was last updated in August and specifies, “to date, FDA has not found clear evidence that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.”\n \n\n   \n  Acetaminophen has been studied for decades to find any problems it may cause in pregnancy,  according to the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.   Not one reputable study has concluded that acetaminophen use in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.\n \n\n   \n  That group points to a study  published  last year of more than 2 million children that found no significant associations between  acetaminophen use  during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.\n \n\n   \n   Another study  published in August analyzed 46 studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Six of the studies specifically examined acetaminophen use and autism. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the paper could only show an association, the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend judicious acetaminophen use — lowest effective dose, shortest duration — under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk–benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation,” the researchers wrote in that analysis.\n \n\n   \n  After the Trump news conference, medicine regulatory agencies for  the European Union  and  the United Kingdom  and  Health Canada  quickly issued statements confirming that taking the over-the-counter pain-reliever during pregnancy remains safe.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/white-house-east-wing-ballroom-construction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-04:00","title":"Demolition begins to replace White House East Wing with Trump’s ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, to make way for a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, fulfilling a 15-year ambition by President Donald Trump.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said over the summer that the “state ballroom” would occupy space housing the East Wing of the executive mansion, where first ladies have traditionally maintained offices.\n \n\n   \n  The project fulfills a 15-year ambition by the president to construct an event space on the White House grounds that expands the building’s entertaining capacity — but also resembles  the gilded spaces  of his private clubs. The ballroom is just one part of Trump’s  efforts to transform  the buildings and grounds to his liking, which have included adding large flagpoles, paving over the Rose Garden, and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\n \n\n   \n  “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump posted on social media Monday evening. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also commented on the construction during an event celebrating LSU baseball teams in the White House’s East Room earlier Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “You know, we’re building right behind us — we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”\n \n\n   \n  Renderings provided by the White House depict a vast space with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, gold floor lamps and a checkered marble floor. Three walls of arched windows look out over the White House’s south grounds.\n \n\n   \n  The new ballroom — which will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion, the White House said — will have a seated capacity of 650 people, more than three times the space in the East Room, the largest event space in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At  a recent dinner  with high-dollar ballroom donors, Trump said the new space would be “in keeping” with the White House architecture. He said it will be “appropriate in color and in window shape.”\n \n\n   \n  “There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  During the dinner, the president said he was told there were “zero zoning conditions” set for the project.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘How long will it take me?’” Trump recalled. “‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday  shared a screenshot  from  Smithsonian Magazine  of construction at the White House during the 1950s, in response to what he called “pearl clutching” after images of the demolition surfaced.\n \n\n   \n  The photo he posted was taken during the Truman administration, when the White House underwent a complete reconstruction after engineers discovered it was “structurally weak and in danger of collapse,” according to the  White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  “Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House,” Cheung wrote on X. “Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized.

moon mission \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:10 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  NASA may sideline SpaceX and choose a different company to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade, acting space agency chief Sean Duffy suggested during TV appearances Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy emphasized that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.\n \n\n   \n  “They push their timelines out, and we’re in a race against China,” Duffy told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday morning, referring to SpaceX’s development of Starship — the vehicle the company plans to use as a lunar lander for NASA. “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX.”\n \n\n   \n  If NASA were to cancel or amend its contract with SpaceX, it could signal a remarkable reversal of a plan the space agency has had in place since 2021. That’s when NASA chose Starship — which is still in the early stages of development and has racked up three in-flight failures and a couple  successful suborbital test flights  so far in 2025 — to serve as lunar lander during the historic moon landing mission, called Artemis III.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy’s remarks on Monday come as that 2021 decision is facing new scrutiny from space industry leaders who are concerned that the logistics involved with using SpaceX’s Starship are too complex and may cause NASA to lose the new moon race, as  CNN previously reported . The Artemis III moon-landing mission is currently set to take place as soon as mid-2027.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on Duffy’s remarks.\n \n\n   \n    What could happen next\n \n\n   \n  The exact timeline for NASA to potentially alter its deal with SpaceX or bring on a new contractor was not immediately clear. In a separate interview on Monday with Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Duffy said he’s “in the process of opening that contract up,” referring to the Artemis lunar lander agreement.\n \n\n   \n  NASA already has two different companies contracted to provide lunar landers: SpaceX with its Starship vehicle, and Blue Origin, the space venture founded by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, which is developing a lander called Blue Moon.\n \n\n   \n  It is Starship, however, that is slated to fly the Artemis III mission in 2027, which would mark the first time astronauts have set foot on the lunar surface since the Apollo program concluded five decades ago. (Blue Origin, which received its NASA contract in 2023, is looking to use Blue Moon to complete Artemis missions later in the program, such as  Artemis V .)\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens said that the space agency gave SpaceX and Blue Origin until October 29 to present “acceleration approaches” for lunar lander development.\n \n\n   \n  “NASA is also going to request plans from the entire commercial space industry - through an RFI (or Request for Information) - for how NASA can increase the cadence of our mission to the Moon,” the statement reads. “President Trump and Secretary Duffy have a mission to beat China back to the Moon. That’s why they are harnessing the power of the American space industry and seeking solutions to develop more ways to land on the Moon.”\n \n\n   \n  The timeline of Artemis III has been the focus of hawkish lawmakers concerned that the landing will not occur before taikonauts — or Chinese astronauts — reach the moon. China has said it will accomplish that feat by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  In his remarks to CNBC, Duffy suggested it could be Blue Origin that takes over SpaceX’s position in the Artemis III mission.\n \n\n   \n  In response to CNN’s request for comment regarding Duffy’s remarks, Blue Origin said only that it is “ready to support.”\n \n\n   \n  However, Duffy also warned that NASA may opt to open up the competition more broadly to providers that do not yet have contracts.\n \n\n   \n  “If SpaceX is behind, but Blue Origin can do it before them, good on Blue Origin,” Duffy said. “But … we’re not going to wait for one company. We’re going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if NASA’s plans to issue a RFI will result in any new companies securing contracts. In government contracting parlance, RFIs are typically considered part of an informal fact-finding process whereas Requests for Proposals, or RFPs, are a more formal solicitation.\n \n\n   \n  Space industry experts have expressed concerns about the timelines for both SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon, noting that the vehicles are complex and may need to be refueled in orbit.\n \n\n   \n  In-orbit refueling has never been attempted, the experts noted, and lunar landers requiring such a step could require prohibitively long development timelines.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what other US companies may be in a position to join SpaceX and Blue Origin in competing for NASA Artemis contracts.\n \n\n   \n  Dynetics, an aerospace company based in Alabama, was among the companies that originally bid for a lunar lander contract alongside Blue Origin and SpaceX.

And in a response to his indictment, Comey said on social media that “there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Requests by defendants for their charges to be dropped based on a claim that they’re being unfairly targeted are rarely granted, but  legal experts have said it’s possible judges could be more receptive to such efforts  in cases like Comey’s given the bevy of public comments by Trump and other officials attacking people the Justice Department is criminally pursuing.\n \n\n   \n  As part of Monday’s filings, Comey’s legal team provided  Judge Michael Nachmanoff  with an extensive list of public statements capturing the former FBI director’s criticism of Trump, and Trump’s subsequent posts attacking Comey. Comey’s lawyers called Trump’s posts “smoking evidence” of an unfair prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “In response to Mr. Comey’s protected speech, President Trump has resorted to personal attacks and calls to retaliate against Mr. Comey through punishment and imprisonment,” Comey’s lawyers wrote. “The pattern of President Trump’s statements and actions demonstrate a clear intent to subject Mr. Comey to ‘[o]fficial reprisal for [his] protected speech.’”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys are also asking the judge to give them permission to pry into the Justice Department’s “prosecutorial decisions” behind its conclusion not to charge other officials who served in top positions in Trump’s first administration.\n \n\n   \n    Disqualifying the US attorney\n \n\n   \n  Comey is arguing that the indictment against him should be thrown out because Trump’s appointment of the interim US attorney who brought charges was entirely unlawful.\n \n\n   \n  Trump appointed White House adviser  Lindsey Halligan , who brought the Comey indictment herself, as the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after the former interim US attorney,  Erik Siebert,  was forced out amid pressure to bring a separate indictment against New York Attorney General  Letitia James. \n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys argued that the previous interim US attorney had already served the legally allotted 120-days that someone can serve as interim before needing to be confirmed by the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan’s appointment after those 120 days had passed means that Trump was not able to appoint a new interim and avoid the senate confirmation process altogether, Comey’s attorneys argue, calling the move a scheme to “circumvent” Congress’ role in the confirmation process.  \n \n\n   \n  Any differing interpretation of the Constitutions’ Appointments Clause would “allow the government to string together sequential 120-day appointments,” his attorneys added, “and thereby indefinitely or perpetually evade Congress’s default requirement of Senate advice and consent.”\n \n\n   \n  Comey’s attorneys pointed to Trump’s own indictment in Florida to argue Halligan’s appointment was unlawful, noting that a federal judge dismissed the case on similar grounds.\n \n\n   \n  In that case, special counsel Jack Smith – who was appointed by the attorney general at the time – charged the then-former president with unlawfully retaining classified documents at his Florida estate following his first term.\n \n\n   \n  The federal judge presiding over that case dismissed the charges against Trump, concluding that Smith’s appointment had “not been authorized by law” because, in part, Congress had not approved his appointment.\n \n\n   \n  “Only a dismissal with prejudice is sufficient to address and deter the Executive Branch’s willfully unlawful conduct in this case,” Comey’s attorneys concluded.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/football-nfl-doug-martin-died-while-being-detained-per-police","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00-04:00","title":"Former NFL Player Doug Martin Dies After Struggle with Police During Arrest for Break-In in Oakland","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former NFL running back Doug Martin, a standout player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and one of the franchise's top 50 players, died after a brief struggle with Oakland police during a detention related to a suspected home break-in.

Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:42 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Jury selection has begun in the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff’s deputy charged with killing  Sonya Massey , a Black woman shot in her home last year after calling police for help.\n \n\n   \n  Sean Grayson, 31, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, fired on the 36-year-old Massey in her Springfield home early on July 6, 2024, after confronting her about how she was handling a pan of hot water Grayson had ordered removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  Security was uncharacteristically tight in Peoria, where the trial has been moved. A police tactical team was deployed around the downtown courthouse and snipers were seen on rooftops surrounding the perimeter.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes and it prompted a change in Illinois law requiring fuller transparency on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  An outdoor protest drew about 60 people, an organizer said. They held signs that read, “The People Demand: End Police Terror” and “United Now Against Racial Violence.” James Wilburn, Massey’s father, watched jury selection in the courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  Questions for prospective jurors from both sides probed attitudes toward law enforcement during a time of intense feelings for or against police. Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser’s questions focused solely on jurors’ relationships with officers or organizations, their monetary or volunteer support and whether they would have trouble justifying a guilty verdict against a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, Milhiser closed his questioning by asking for a show of hands from jurors who believed police officers may use whatever level of force they deem necessary in doing their jobs — none did. The defense likely will argue that Grayson was justified in his use of force because of the pan of hot water Massey held.\n \n\n   \n  Defense attorney Dan Fultz gauged panel members’ comfort level in returning a not guilty verdict but spent considerable time asking jurors generally about personal obligations and simply whether they wanted to be impaneled.\n \n\n   \n  By midday, attorneys had nearly completed questioning a second pool of a dozen jurors; from the first panel, four had been chosen to serve on the 12-person jury.\n \n\n   \n  Massey’s killing raised new questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their homes  and prompted a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the charges:\n \n\n   \n    Trial relocated due to national attention\n \n\n   \n  In addition to first-degree murder, Grayson is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n  Widespread attention to Grayson’s shooting of Massey prompted Sangamon County Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles southwest of Chicago. Jurors will instead come from Peoria and surrounding areas, an hour’s drive north, and will hear the case in their local courthouse.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n    Body camera footage shows shooting\n \n\n   \n  After Grayson and another deputy checked the area around Massey’s house, Grayson knocked on her door to report they had found nothing suspicious, body camera video shows. He entered the house to obtain details for a report, noticed a pan on the stove and ordered its removal. Massey picked it up.\n \n\n   \n  She laughingly asked Grayson why he was backing away; he said he was trying to avoid the “hot, steaming water.” Massey responded, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson wrote in an incident report, “I interpreted this to mean  she was going to kill me .”\n \n\n   \n  According to body camera video, Grayson pulled his 9 mm pistol and yelled at Massey to drop the pot. She apologized then put the pan down and ducked behind a counter, but in the confusion, as Grayson yelled, it appears she picked it up again.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson fired three times, hitting  Massey once just below the left eye .\n \n\n   \n    Massey’s family had sought mental health care\n \n\n   \n  Massey, a single mother of two teenagers who had a strong religious faith, was beset by mental health problems. When she answered Grayson’s knock minutes before the shooting, she said, “Don’t hurt me,” and then, as she was questioned and Grayson asked her if she was all right, she repeatedly said, “Please God.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier that same week, Sonya Massey had admitted herself to a  30-day inpatient mental health program  in St. Louis but returned two days later without explanation.\n \n\n   \n  In the days leading up to the shooting,  three 911 calls were made  by Massey or on her behalf, county records indicate. In one, her mother, Donna Massey, told authorities her daughter was suffering a “mental breakdown.” Donna Massey also told the dispatcher, “I don’t want you guys to hurt her.”\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was not aware of the calls or Massey’s background. County officials have since said there’s no practical way to determine and communicate such information for police responding to emergency calls.\n \n\n   \n    Deputy’s history prompted state reform\n \n\n   \n  Grayson was  arrested 11 days after killing Massey and fired  from the sheriff’s department.\n \n\n   \n  As his background was scrutinized, Massey’s family and others questioned why Grayson, who had been a Sangamon County deputy sheriff for 14 months,  had been hired at all .\n \n\n   \n  In his early 20s, he was ejected from the Army for a drunken-driving arrest in which he had a weapon in his car. He was convicted of a DUI again within the year.\n \n\n   \n  Before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department, Grayson had four policing jobs in six years – the first three of which were part-time.\n \n\n   \n  There was no indication Grayson had been fired from any job, but evaluations from past employers documented concerns about him. One department reported that while Grayson worked hard and had a good attitude, he struggled with report writing, was “not great with evidence – left items laying around office” and was “a bragger.”\n \n\n   \n  Jack Campbell, the Sangamon County sheriff,  was forced to retire  six weeks after the shooting. He insisted none of Grayson’s issues disqualified him from working as a deputy.\n \n\n   \n  State law enforcement authorities had certified Grayson to serve in each of his previous jobs, but Campbell  required him to attend the 16-week police academy  training course nonetheless.\n \n\n   \n  In August, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker  signed a law requiring  that prospective police officers permit the release of all personal and employment background records to any law enforcement agency considering hiring them. Legislative sponsors of the measure acknowledged it doesn’t prevent candidates with checkered paths from being hired but provides greater transparency.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/chicago-ice-trump-federal-officials-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"18:22:00-04:00","title":"Federal officials try to reassure judge they’re following her orders to tone down and record Chicagoland protest actions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Chicago, Sara Ellis, is demanding accountability from federal immigration enforcement agencies—specifically CBP and ICE—after reporting that agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls without warning protesters during demonstrations tied to Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration immigration crackdown.

Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:22 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials are defending themselves in court as a federal judge demands explanations for their response to tense protests against immigration enforcement actions in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s hearing began with a promise Customs and Border Protection is taking seriously the judge’s order for its agents to wear and use body-worn cameras: Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis then calmly peppered Harvick with questions about how agents working on Operation Midway Blitz are trained and respond to protesters in and around Chicago, the latest target of President Donald Trump’s  immigration crackdown . The hearing was called in response to news reports suggesting agents were violating her order to avoid less-lethal munitions and tear gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis,  an Obama appointee , initially had called for the interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, Russell Hott, to appear Monday “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” After seeming to agree to her request, the Department of Homeland Security told Ellis on Friday that Hott had left the city to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration instead offered Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, and Ellis agreed – as long as the officials would disclose how the agencies are deploying riot control tactics against protesters and journalists.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m looking at it from the outside,” Ellis said in court Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said Monday, however, she will allow Hott and Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent at CBP, to be deposed at a later time.\n \n\n   \n  She added since Hott was the highest officer in Chicago at the time the protests occurred, he should be able to speak to what happened.\n \n\n   \n  The judge last week added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls on them.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” Ellis said then.\n \n\n   \n  Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE  deployment  across Chicagoland, yielding more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent  demonstration  in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. A government attorney  last week  said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n    Judge wants answers\n \n\n   \n  Ellis early this month issued a  sweeping order  restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During  last week’s hearing , she said she had concerns about her order being followed.\n \n\n   \n  The judge indicated recent news reports had led her to believe the Trump administration may not have been following her instructions.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not happy,” Ellis said in a stern tone. “I’m really not happy.”\n \n\n   \n  “At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” she said from the bench.\n \n\n   \n   The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras. But her order doesn’t require them if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials claimed Harvick would be the most appropriate person to testify after DHS determined it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in recent tear gas incidents, CNN affiliate  WTTW reported .\n \n\n   \n  During a telephone hearing that day, the judge said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government presents at Monday’s hearing but that she’s been “very clear” she wants to hear from someone who can fill her in on “what’s been going on over the last week,” the station reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” Ellis said, according to WTTW. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”\n \n\n   \n    Protests continue at Broadview\n \n\n   \n  This weekend  marked  the first since a fence was ordered removed at the Broadview ICE facility, the center of anti-ICE protests in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.\n \n\n   \n  Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday in connection with another demonstration at the facility, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Byers, the ICE deputy field office director, said Monday he has reviewed incidents involving protesters at the facility and no one has been disciplined.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/brett-james-ntsb-report","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00-04:00","title":"Songwriter Brett James’ plane enters spiral before crashing, NTSB says","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, known for his collaborations with major music stars such as Taylor Swift, Bon Jovi, Keith Urban, and Kenny Chesney, died in a plane crash on September 18, 2025, in Franklin, North Carolina.

Colombians are expressing a mix of frustration and worry amid an escalating  diplomatic feud  between the leaders of Colombia and the United States.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut subsidies and raise tariffs on Colombia, which he sees as largely having failed to combat drug cartels producing illegal narcotics and shipping them to the US.\n \n\n   \n  In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs.” Petro responded by saying Trump was “rude and ignorant” toward the South American nation.\n \n\n   \n  The remarks — the latest in  series of barbs  between both leaders — have fueled anxiety among Colombian citizens, who fear the spat could have serious consequences for their lives.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s right that the just pay for the sinners. If Trump imposes more tariffs, many jobs will be lost, and many companies will go bankrupt,” said Ángel Duarte, a Colombian taxi driver.\n \n\n   \n  If new tariffs are imposed, the impact on trade would be substantial, as the United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of Colombian exports, according to Colombia’s National Association of Foreign Trade. Oil, coffee, flowers, gold, fruits and manufactured goods are the main products that depend on US purchases. An increase in tariffs would make key exports more expensive and affect workers and consumers.\n \n\n   \n  Sofia Anaya, a housewife in Colombia, worries that the feud will also affect people’s ability to obtain visas. “I have my daughter in the United States, and I have to renew my visa this year,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She argued that Petro brought this upon himself, given the number of times he has insulted Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Petro has previously clashed with the Trump administration on migration and drug-trafficking issues. In September, he called for US officials, including Trump, to face “criminal proceedings” over US strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The US later  revoked Petro’s visa  after he spoke at a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York and called on US soldiers to disobey Trump’s orders.\n \n\n   \n  Colombian university student Gustavo Cuesta, meanwhile, faulted the US president. “Calling President Gustavo Petro a drug trafficking leader is an insult to the entire country. And it must be rejected,” he said. “Trump is not the owner of the world. One must show respect.”\n \n\n   \n  Javier Gaitán, a retiree in Colombia, said both presidents deserve criticism: “They both speak without considering the consequences. Meanwhile, the drug traffickers remain calm. Here in Colombia, the drug issue has no solution. There’s a lot of money involved.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s threat to cut off funding would cause Colombia to lose its largest provider of economic and military assistance in the fight against drug trafficking, including resources for the eradication of illicit crops such as coca and opium poppies, which are used to produce cocaine and heroin. Funds total about $450 million annually, although Trump has not specified which items he would cut.\n \n\n   \n  “Petro has to find a way to solve this with the gringos,” said Duarte. “In the end, it’s the people who are hurt.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/gaza-ceasefire-trump-polls","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"16:04:00Z","title":"Americans shrug at Trump’s Gaza deal, as economic fears reign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite the announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal, President Donald Trump's domestic approval ratings remain at historic lows, with strong disapproval on economic issues such as inflation and the cost of living.

But when it came to the  Gaza ceasefire deal  last week, even many of Trump’s critics didn’t begrudge him a prolonged victory lap.\n \n\n   \n  A week later, though, the situation appears to have meant little if anything on the domestic front.\n \n\n   \n  Not only has the tenuousness of the agreement come into sharp focus, with Vice President JD Vance leading a delegation to Israel this week as the deal hangs in the balance, but Trump’s political standing appears almost unchanged at home, if not worse.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps most remarkably: Americans don’t even seem to be particularly enthused about Trump’s handling of the Gaza issue.\n \n\n   \n  The situation appears to reinforce that negative views of Trump are largely baked-in at this point, and that negative views of his handling of domestic issues — especially the economy — are likely to continue to carry much more weight.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve now seen two quality polls conducted after the announcement of the ceasefire deal on October 8. Both show Trump’s approval is virtually unchanged. And though his numbers on Gaza appear to have ticked up, not even that appears to be a strength.\n \n\n   \n  An  AP-NORC poll  released Friday showed Trump’s approval rating on Gaza improving from 37% in September to 47%. (The poll was conducted October 9-13.) But about the same number disapproved: 49%.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s overall approval split was actually worse than at any point in his second term, with 37% approving and 61% disapproving. Those numbers rival Trump’s worst numbers since his first year in office in 2017.\n \n\n   \n  The story was similar in a  CNBC poll  released Friday.\n \n\n   \n  It showed Trump remained significantly underwater on the issue of the war in Gaza, with Americans disapproving 50%-41%.\n \n\n   \n  It also showed Trump’s approval rating at a second-term low, with Americans disapproving 52%-44%.\n \n\n   \n  How could this be, after what was viewed as such a major win for the president on the world stage — something that even some Trump critics said lent credence to his  lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize ?\n \n\n   \n  One possibility is that views were still forming, with much of the polling conducted between the deal being struck and Trump’s travel to the Middle East for his  victory lap . The fact that Trump’s ratings on Gaza, specifically, weren’t that great might suggest people weren’t tuned in.\n \n\n   \n  But recent events suggest even such a bump, if it were to materialize, could be just as fleeting, given tensions are rising in the region again. And it also seems possible Americans are taking a wait-and-see approach, recognizing how often we’ve seen hope for Middle East peace suddenly evaporate. (It was just in January, after all, that the Biden administration  struck its own ceasefire deal,  which lasted about two months.)\n \n\n   \n  The more likely interpretation, though, resides in that age-old political adage: “It’s the economy, stupid.”\n \n\n   \n  It hasn’t gotten as much attention in recent weeks, but Trump’s numbers on the economy continue to deteriorate — especially as the apparent negative impacts of the president’s tariffs set in and inflation proves stubborn.\n \n\n   \n  The CNBC poll is a case in point.\n \n\n   \n  It shows views of Trump’s handling of inflation and the cost of living hitting a new low, with Americans disapproving 62%-34%. He’s also 13 points underwater on the broader issue of the economy — his worst net approval rating on that topic in either his first or second terms.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also suggests pessimism is setting in. It shows new lows in the percentages of Americans who say they expect the economy to improve over the next year (32%) and for their own wages to rise (31%).\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of employed Americans who say they’re not at all worried about losing their jobs has also dropped to 52% — which is lower than at any point in the final three years of the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  Those are striking numbers, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the American people place much more emphasis on them than on the Gaza issue. That’s especially given other polling has shown foreign policy issues are very low on Americans’ priority list. Just 4% in a recent  CBS News-YouGov poll  ranked international events as the most important issue facing the country.\n \n\n   \n  The same poll showed three-fourths of Americans don’t think Trump has focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  Maybe people are less concerned with Nobel prizes than they are grocery prices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/16/us/trump-universities-compact-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"17:49:00Z","title":"7 Universities Reject White House Funding Deal with Attached Demands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has proposed a funding compact for nine U.S. universities, offering expanded access to federal grants and invitations to White House events in exchange for policy changes such as removing sex and ethnicity from admissions, capping international student enrollment, and adopting specific gender definitions based on biology.

Multiple other schools have yet to respond \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:49 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The battle for academic freedom and institutional sovereignty in higher education continues to play out as another university has rejected  a White House offer for expanded access to federal funding  in return for agreeing to a series of demands.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the University of Arizona declined an offer by the Trump administration to join a compact that would potentially give preferential funding in exchange for a list of changes to school policy, including no longer considering sex and ethnicity in admissions and capping international enrollment. The letter was sent to nine universities at the beginning of the month, and a total of seven schools have rejected the offer so far.\n \n\n   \n  The compact is aimed at “the proactive improvement of higher education for the betterment of the country,” according to a letter sent to the universities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter addressed to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella said, “We seek no special treatment and believe in our ability to compete for federally funded research strictly on merit.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Arizona’s refusal comes after the University of Virginia rejected the offer after a meeting at the White House on Friday. USC, Penn, Brown University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have all also rejected the proposal. Other schools – a mix of public and private universities – have either said they are reviewing the compact or haven’t commented publicly.\n \n\n   \n  Before UVA announced it was declining the offer, Trump officials on Friday convened representatives from the school and several other universities – including three additional schools that have now been asked to sign on to the compact, a White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  The White House cast Friday’s conversation as “productive” and said it is now up to the schools to decide. CNN has reached out to the remaining schools for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The offers come as the Trump administration attempts different methods of crafting an  unprecedented level of control over universities  – among the centers of cultural debate in American life.\n \n\n   \n  As universities contemplate the Trump administration’s offer, here is what we know about the choice ahead.\n \n\n   \n    What the compact is\n \n\n   \n  Letters were sent to nine universities on October 1, asking them to agree to a series of demands in return for expanded access to federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  The schools that received the initial letters, according to a White House official, include: Vanderbilt University, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, University of Southern California, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas at Austin, University of Arizona, Brown University and University of Virginia. Several of these schools have already had  funding   disputes  with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, another three schools – Arizona State University, University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis – were also asked to take part in the agreement, a White House official said. Representatives from the three schools were at Friday’s meeting at the White House, along with Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, and UVA.\n \n\n   \n  The universities were asked to implement ideological polices, such as removing factors like sex and ethnicity from admissions consideration, to foster “a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” with “no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines,” as well as to assess faculty and staff viewpoints, and adopt definitions of gender “according to reproductive function and biological processes,” according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Schools that sign on must also commit to reforming or shuttering “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” the document says.\n \n\n   \n  The letters also request changes to other aspects of university culture, including a commitment to “grade integrity,” a mandatory five-year freeze on tuition costs, and a 15% required cap on international students, the document says.\n \n\n   \n  If the schools enter the agreement, they “would be given priority for grants when possible as well as invitations for White House events and discussions with officials,” a White House official said when the letters were sent.\n \n\n   \n  To ensure enforcement, the compact would require faculty, students and staff to participate in an annual “anonymous poll” to see if universities are complying with the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  While the letter said that “limited, targeted feedback” would be welcomed, the compact was “largely in its final form” and hoped to have initial signatories “no later than November 21, 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  An initial copy of the compact was drafted in December, according to a source familiar with the matter, with edits and changes made collaboratively since the president returned to the White House.\n \n\n   \n    What is at stake for the schools\n \n\n   \n  Colleges and universities have been a target for Trump’s second term, and this is one of several attempts to get select universities to comply with their ideological requirements.\n \n\n   \n  Some schools, including several of the nine schools that received the letters, have been involved in funding battles since the new administration assumed power. While some prominent schools have made deals or concessions, others  maintain their concerns  despite pressure through government investigations or revoked grants.\n \n\n   \n  Schools have even invested in federal lobbying,  with a CNN analysis showing  that Trump’s higher education targets have together spent 122% more in lobbying expenses in Q2 of this year compared with last year, with nine out of 14 institutions singled out by Trump doubling their spending since last year.\n \n\n   \n  Signing onto the compact would give the universities “a competitive advantage,” a White House official previously said. The letter also said that it would “yield multiple positive benefits for the school, including allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.”\n \n\n   \n    How schools have responded\n \n\n   \n  Of the nine universities that the officials said were sent the letter, seven have formally responded by declining the offer – MIT, Penn, Brown University, USC, Dartmouth College, the University of Virginia, and the University of Arizona.\n \n\n   \n  University of Arizona President Garimella said in response to McMahon’s letter, “We have much common ground with the ideas your administration is advancing on changes that would benefit American higher education and our nation at large.” But, “a federal research funding system based on anything other than merit would weaken the world’s preeminent engine for innovation, advancement of technology, and solutions to many of our nation’s most profound challenges.”\n \n\n   \n  Dartmouth College declined the offer Saturday morning. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock maintained the school needs to set its own policies according to its mission and values, she said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a compact—with any administration—is the right approach to achieve academic excellence, as it would compromise our academic freedom, our ability to govern ourselves, and the principle that federal research funds should be awarded to the best, most promising ideas,” Beilock said.\n \n\n   \n  The University of Virginia  declined the offer  Friday, just hours after school officials attended a meeting at the White House regarding the compact. While there are many areas of agreement in the proposed compact, “we believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation,” university interim President Paul Mahoney said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  University of Pennsylvania President J. Larry Jameson  said  he informed the US Department of Education Thursday that the school declines the proposed compact after receiving input from faculty, students, trustees and others.\n \n\n   \n  Penn “provided focused feedback highlighting areas of existing alignment as well as substantive concerns,” Jameson said in a statement to the community.\n \n\n   \n  USC  also declined the offer  Thursday, with the university’s Interim President Beong-Soo Kim citing concerns with agreeing to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  While the school recognizes the administration is trying to address issues in higher education, “tying research benefits to it (the compact) would, over time, undermine the same values of free inquiry and academic excellence that the Compact seeks to promote,” Kim said in a letter to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon that was shared online.\n \n\n   \n  “Other countries whose governments lack America’s commitment to freedom and democracy have shown how academic excellence can suffer when shifting external priorities tilt the research playing field away from free, meritocratic competition,” Kim said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom previously threatened to  withhold state funding  to universities in his state that agree to the compact.\n \n\n   \n  MIT  announced its refusal  on October 10, when university President Sally Kornbluth said she acknowledged “the vital importance of these matters,” but that the compact included principles that ultimately “would restrict freedom of expression and our independence as an institution.”\n \n\n   \n  Brown University President Christina H. Paxson made similar comments in  her Wednesday letter to the administration , saying they plan to  abide by a July 30 agreement  they previously reached with the government, but that this compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.”\n \n\n   \n  Vanderbilt University Chancellor Daniel Diermeier rejected reports that the Nashville university had been asked to accept or reject the compact. “We have been asked to provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue, and that is our intention,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that “academic freedom, free expression and independence are essential for universities to make their vital and singular contributions to society.”\n \n\n   \n  The University of Texas at Austin took a different tone than its counterparts. They didn’t say if they would sign the agreement, but they “welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/entertainment/netflix-kennedy-family-series-michael-fassbender","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:31:00Z","title":"Netflix Announces New Kennedy Family Series Starring Michael Fassbender","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Netflix is launching a new drama series titled 'Kennedy,' based on Fredrik Logevall’s biography, which explores the rise and tragedies of the Kennedy family from the 1930s to 1956.

Talk of a Kennedy curse was reinforced when, among other unfortunate events, the former’s son, JFK Jr., lost his life along with his wife and sister-in-law in a plane crash in 1999.\n \n\n   \n  A description of the show revealed that the series will begin long before John F. Kennedy occupied the White House, with the first season beginning in the 1930s and charting “the improbable ascent of Joe and Rose Kennedy and their nine children, including rebellious second son Jack, who struggles to escape the shadow of his golden boy older brother.”\n \n\n   \n  “The story of the Kennedys is the closest we have to American mythology — somewhere between Shakespeare and The Bold and the Beautiful. But Fredrik Logevall’s stunning, nuanced biography pulls a veil on the human strivings and burdens behind the myth, revealing as much about our present moment, how we got here and where we’re going, as about the Kennedys themselves,” showrunner Sam Shaw said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The series, not to be confused with the  upcoming Ryan Murphy-produced “American Love Story” focusing on JFK Jr. , does not yet have a release date. It will run for eight episodes.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/curtis-sliwa-nyc-mayoral-race","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00-20:00","title":"Curtis Sliwa’s boss becomes the latest Republican trying to push him out of NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curtis Sliwa, a Republican mayoral candidate in New York City, is facing growing pressure from his boss John Catsimatidis and other Republicans to withdraw from the race, who argue Sliwa does not represent the city’s interests.

Curtis Sliwa’s boss becomes the latest Republican trying to push him out of NYC mayoral race \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:20 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republican New York City mayoral candidate  Curtis Sliwa  is facing renewed pressure to drop his bid for mayor – this time directly from his boss.\n \n\n   \n  John Catsimatidis, the Republican supermarket magnate and lifelong New Yorker, took to the airwaves of WABC-AM, the radio station he owns and where Sliwa hosts a show, to call for him to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I love Curtis; we’ve worked together a lot,” Catsimatidis said.\n \n\n   \n  “Curtis has to realize that he should love New York more than anything else, and it certainly looks like Curtis should pull out right now,” Catsimatidis added.\n \n\n   \n  Catsimatidis and some other Republicans  have rallied behind Andrew Cuomo , who is running as an independent, in a bid to stop  Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani  from becoming mayor. Cuomo and his allies are pushing Sliwa to drop out after successfully getting  Mayor Eric Adams to leave the race , arguing the former New York governor could then consolidate opposition to Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, who has worked for WABC radio for decades, has been on leave from the station since launching his bid for mayor, according to a release issued by Catsimatidis.\n \n\n   \n  The back-and-forth over Sliwa’s future in the race appears to have only emboldened him. Having drawn new attention from his  performance in Thursday’s debate , Sliwa has dismissed Cuomo and his backers as he argues voters should have the last word when it comes to New York City’s future.\n \n\n   \n  During an  interview  posted Saturday with YouTube journalist Nate Friedman, Sliwa rebuked Cuomo and high-profile backers, including Bill Ackman, who has been sharply critical of both Sliwa and Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “Now he’s saying I can’t win without Sliwa votes – where are your votes? He’s got millions from the billionaires, millions – go out, get you a vote, convert Sliwa voters,” Sliwa said of Cuomo. “But for me to drop out? I represent a major party line. This is called voting. Since when do we not let people vote? Billionaires determine the next mayor? If they don’t like it, they can leave, they have options. Blue-collar working-class people don’t; those are the people I am representing, not Andrew Cuomo.”\n \n\n   \n  Catsimatidis’ comments come a day after President Donald Trump was asked whether he would get involved in the race for mayor and support Sliwa. Trump has been dismissive of the Republican nominee, referring to him as “not exactly primetime,” and mocking Sliwa’s affinity for cats and animal rescues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I a big fan?” Trump said Sunday, speaking to Fox News. “This isn’t exactly ideal, where he wants to make Gracie Mansion a home for the cats you know?”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, best known for founding the Guardian Angels crime group, is a perennial mayoral candidate who ran in 2021 and has never held political office. He’s polling third in the current race behind Mamdani and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has openly appealed to Republicans, trying to cast himself as the moderate choice against Mamdani. He has tried to discredit Sliwa, referring to him as a “shock jock” and arguing anyone who does not support Mamdani should vote for him and not Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “Curtis Sliwa is not an alternative, he’s not a viable candidate,” Cuomo said over the weekend speaking on Fox News. “You vote for Curtis, you might as well vote for Zohran Mamdani directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The comments have made Mamdani and Sliwa strange bedfellows, to the point that aides to Cuomo have started to suggest Mamdani and Sliwa are coordinating.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about it Monday, Mamdani laughed off the suggestion.\n \n\n   \n  “That is one place where Curtis and I agree, which is, it’s time for New Yorkers to make this decision, not for billionaire donors to determine who gets to run in this city,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he was advising Sliwa to stay in the race, Mamdani said, “My advice to him is continue making his own case. I’m focused on making my own case to New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/americas/colombia-ambassador-us-recalled-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"14:25:00-04:00","title":"Colombian ambassador to US recalled to Bogotá for consultations, embassy says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Colombia has recalled its ambassador to the United States, Daniel García-Peña, for consultations, in response to escalating tensions over drug trafficking and U.S. military actions.

Whitaker pointed to a Biden administration attorney who ran the civil division at DOJ without being Senate confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “When the attorney general designates someone that is a distinct kind of service,” Whitaker told the panel. “Congress recognized nonetheless we can keep the lights on and we can continue to have officials exercise functions purely by delegation.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether there is an expiration to delegated authority, Whitaker said there is not. He was adamant that the administration was not trying to circumvent the normal practice of Senate confirmation, but admitted they’ve “jumped through hoops” to get their people in place. To prove that they’re trying to follow the normal practice, he noted that 16 US attorneys were recently confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  DOJ is appealing a  lower court’s ruling  that found Habba is serving in the role unlawfully after finding the administration violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which guides the process for how Senate confirmed positions should be made. That decision prompted challenges in other states, including Nevada where the US attorney appointed there was also found to be serving improperly. Another challenge over the US attorney for the Central District of California is currently being litigated.\n \n\n   \n  The concept is also expected to be raised by former FBI Director James Comey as he fights federal charges brought by former White House aide Lindsey Halligan. Halligan, who is now US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also brought the criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Comey and James have denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which includes New Jersey, heard arguments on Monday. Two of the judges were appointed by Republicans – President Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush – and one judge by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n \n\n   \n  Habba was initially serving as interim US attorney for New Jersey until that term expired after 120 days. She resigned and was named special attorney, designated as first assistant US attorney and then delegated the authority of the US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Defendants in two cases argued she was serving unlawfully. A district court judge agreed and found that the first assistant US attorney at the time of the vacancy should automatically fill the position and if that isn’t possible, the president can appoint someone who is Senate confirmed or has been serving in the Justice Department for at least 90 days.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department also argued that Habba can serve through authority delegated by the attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker said there are different ways to fill vacancies across government and they are selecting which laws to invoke. “We are not asking for limitless power to designate officials,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whitaker said Habba can serve in her role until February when a term of 200 days expires, but conceded if Habba is serving under delegation authority there is no expiration.\n \n\n   \n  Abbe Lowell, who argued on behalf of the defendants, said DOJ is “constructing this gerry-rigged way to get Ms. Habba to be in power.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowell said the attorney general can delegate authority but only for a specific role, such as the designation of a special attorney to investigate mortgage fraud, but all the power of a US attorney – overseeing criminal and civil investigations, giving speeches, and moving personnel – cannot be delegated.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never happened,” he told the panel. “In their interpretation the only thing she doesn’t have is the certificate on the wall that says ‘US attorney,’” Lowell said.\n \n\n   \n  A judge pressed Whitaker on his contention that this is a common practice and then recited the multiple steps that played out over a week to reassert Habba to serve essentially as US attorney.\n \n\n   \n  “Can you come up with an example of any time that such a catenation of events has occurred with respect to the appointment of a United States attorney,” the judge asked Whitaker.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess I cannot,” Whitaker said. He said the judges should find that Habba has authority to supervise cases the same way assistant US attorneys are authorized to conduct criminal investigations – through authority that traces back to the attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  Following the court hearing, Habba placed the blame on Congress, where lawmakers have blocked the nominations of over a dozen US attorney candidates.\n \n\n   \n  “The President appoints individuals to carry out the mission of this administration and that mandate should be respected. When millions of Americans voted for a change in leadership in November, they voted for a new direction. That choice should not be undermined by political obstruction in Congress or by criminal defendants,”  Habba wrote on X .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/murdaugh-family-deaths-timeline","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Concerns Raised Over Asylum Seeker's Detention Without Legal Basis","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An asylum seeker, identified as Asylum Seeker A, was detained by Immigration Authority B on October 3, 2023, without a valid legal basis.

He was found guilty in March 2023 in a  closely watched case  and  sentenced  to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh’s attorneys appealed for a new trial based on allegations of jury tampering; legal briefs have been filed but it’s unclear when the state Supreme Court will consider the case.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, Murdaugh, an attorney who was later disbarred, pleaded guilty to dozens of federal and state charges of financial crimes related to a wide-ranging scheme to bilk his law firm, clients and the government out of about $9.3 million, according to the  state attorney general .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a timeline of all the twists and turns in the Murdaugh family saga:\n \n\n   \n    1920-2006\n \n\n   \n  Over three generations, a member of the Murdaugh family has served as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, which leads prosecutions for Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties in the southern part of South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Randolph Murdaugh Sr. was elected to the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office in 1920 and served in the position until his death in 1940.\n \n\n   \n  His son, Randolph Murdaugh Jr., took over the position and served until his retirement in 1986.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh Jr.’s son, Randolph Murdaugh III, was elected to the role in 1987 and served through the end of 2005.\n \n\n   \n  Murdaugh III’s son, Alex Murdaugh, worked as an attorney at the law firm Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick, known as PMPED.\n \n\n   \n  In 2006, then-Gov. Mark Sanford appointed attorney Duffie Stone to serve as the 14th Circuit solicitor, making him the first non-Murdaugh in the position. He has been elected to the position five times since, most recently in 2024, according to  the solicitor’s website .\n \n\n   \n    2018\n \n\n   \n  Gloria Satterfield, a longtime housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, dies in what is described as a “trip and fall accident” at the Murdaugh home, according to attorney Eric Bland, who represented her estate.\n \n\n   \n  After Satterfield’s death, a $500,000 wrongful death claim was filed against Alex Murdaugh on behalf of her estate,  Bland said .\n \n\n   \n    2019\n \n\n   \n  A boat crashes at a bridge near Parris Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, on February 24, killing 19-year-old Mallory Beach, according to the South Carolina attorney general in documents obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Six people were on board at the time, including Alex Murdaugh’s 19-year-old son, Paul. Murdaugh owned the boat.\n \n\n   \n  Stone recuses himself from the case because of personal connections.\n \n\n   \n  Paul Murdaugh is indicted in April on charges of boating under the influence (BUI) causing great bodily harm and causing death in connection to the crash, court records show.

 By Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:52 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors are attempting to bring into court doubts that former FBI Director James Comey’s lead defense lawyer can represent him fairly, given Comey’s history being investigated, in a new legal dispute in the case that Comey’s team has already called an “effort to defame.”\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors suggested late Sunday that Patrick Fitzgerald could have “potential conflict and disqualification issue” in the case because Comey may have used the attorney to disseminate classified material in 2017 – an allegation Comey’s attorneys called “provably false.”\n \n\n   \n  In a filing over evidence, prosecutors say “quarantined evidence” in the case contains communication between Comey and Fitzgerald.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,” prosecutors wrote in Monday’s filing.\n \n\n   \n  Fitzgerald, citing a report from the Justice Department’s inspector general who investigated the allegations previously, noted that “the report ‘found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to the media.’”\n \n\n   \n  “After Mr. Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, he sought legal advice with respect to his termination and with regard to having witnessed behavior by the President that he considered unlawful,” Fitzgerald wrote in Monday’s responsive filing.\n \n\n   \n  Comey was fired a few months after Trump took office, following his agency’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n \n\n   \n  “This is always a dicey situation,” former federal prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said of the DOJ’s filing on CNN this morning. “Look, you are never supposed to be both a lawyer and a witness in the

Specifically: the wrongful deportation of  Kilmar Abrego Garcia .\n \n\n   \n  Could it now be happening with another legally dubious and highly punitive Trump effort in Latin America?\n \n\n   \n  We learned last week that one of the most recent Trump administration strikes on an alleged drug-carrying submarine in the Caribbean  failed to kill two of the people aboard .\n \n\n   \n  The situation has now cast a spotlight on the holes in the administration’s justifications for the strikes, which  were already suspect . But now the dilemma over what to do with the survivors has crystallized that fact and injected the situation with new urgency.\n \n\n   \n  Even some Republicans have questioned the legality of the strikes, and the events of last week could make it more difficult to move on — as Trump’s GOP critics have often been wont to do.\n \n\n   \n  To recap: The administration, CNN has reported, scrambled to figure out what to do with the two survivors before deciding  to release them to their respective home countries  — Colombia and Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  Some have wagered that this shows these two men might have been innocent; the administration, after all, has not provided public evidence for its claims that its targets are “narco-terrorists.” And some people in the relevant Latin American countries, including the  victims’ families  and  Colombian President Gustavo Petro , have called the Trump administration’s general claims about targets into question. Petro, for example, has said a Colombian killed in an earlier strike was a “fisherman” with “no ties to the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  But even if these survivors did what the administration claims, the administration’s move to release them undercuts its claims about the conflict in the Caribbean. Releasing them is very difficult to square with the argument that the US government is engaged in a war with people who would do imminent harm to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Put plainly: If these people are so dangerous and engaged in what is allegedly warfare against the United States, how could they be released?\n \n\n   \n  Trump claimed just this weekend that “ at least 25,000 Americans would die  if I allowed this submarine to come ashore.” (Trump hasn’t provided evidence for that statement, and the administration’s claims about such things  are often hyperbolic .) If these men were engaged in the attempted mass killing of Americans, how in the world does the US leave holding them accountable to other countries?\n \n\n   \n  “Dangerous enough to try to kill with military force but not dangerous enough to detain and prosecute via lawful methods …”  summarized  Harvard University law professor Jack Goldsmith, who led the George W. Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel.\n \n\n   \n  We don’t know the full details of the legal justification the administration is using, because it won’t publicly release it. But we do know that it is  effectively claiming war-like powers  to target the alleged drug vessels — despite the lack of a congressionally declared war.\n \n\n   \n  The benefit of releasing these men instead of detaining them appears to be in the legal process.\n \n\n   \n  Despite widespread concerns about the  potential illegality of the strikes , to date there doesn’t appear to have been a legal basis to challenge them in court. That could have changed if the men were detained.\n \n\n   \n  If the United States attempted to try the survivors in US civilian court, the administration would have to prove that they engaged in the activities they are accused of. That would mean the administration would actually have to pony up the evidence it has declined to publicly release.\n \n\n   \n  As The Washington Post reported in an extensive look at the situation Monday, many experts are  skeptical about the administration’s claims  that these vessels are trafficking fentanyl that could kill Americans. The area where the strikes are being carried out isn’t ordinarily used for that purpose, The Post reported, and the drugs seized there aren’t usually headed for the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The administration could also have held the survivors as wartime detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. But at that point, legal advocates could challenge the legality of their detentions by invoking the right of habeas corpus. That would have forced courts to finally reckon with whether this is really the war the Trump administration claims it is.\n \n\n   \n  The administration appears to have decided it simply doesn’t want to deal with those legal headaches — for whatever reason.\n \n\n   \n  But that, in and of itself, is extraordinary. It would seem that, to avoid a legal process, the administration has decided to leave punishing the alleged would-be mass killers of Americans to other countries. Colombia’s president, in particular, doesn’t appear to be on the same page as Trump on such matters.\n \n\n   \n  The issue hasn’t been a major point of emphasis for Congress as yet. The reasons for that appear varied. Congress is consumed by the government shutdown. Lawmakers might not want to look like they are standing up for alleged drug traffickers — just like Democrats were wary of looking like they were standing up for undocumented immigrants amid the Abrego case. And some senators who might have doubts about the strikes could be deferring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former colleague whom they confirmed 99-0 in January and has led the charge in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  But the concerns have slowly simmered. Two Senate Republicans voted to halt the boat strikes earlier this month. A bipartisan group is  looking at forcing another vote .\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana recently said he was “ highly concerned about the legality of recent strikes  in the Caribbean and the trajectory of military operations without congressional approval or debate and the support of the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican-controlled Congress basically has to be dragged into action to check Trump these days. But the events of the past week may make the administration’s actions harder to ignore.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/entertainment/lance-bass-diabetes-nsync-reunion","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"Lance Bass has more to say about living with diabetes than he does about an *NSYNC reunion","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lance Bass, a former member of the boy band *NSYNC, addresses fan speculation about a potential reunion by stating there is no current plan, and instead emphasizes his openness about living with type 1.5 diabetes, also known as LADA.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition is the latest group to take a strong public stand in support of vaccination as a direct response to concerns that the federal government is limiting access and raising doubts.\n \n\n   \n  “We are united behind a simple message: get vaccinated,” the group wrote in a  statement  that was published Monday. It was signed by two dozen public health leaders from some of the nation’s largest cities, in both Democrat- and Republican-led states.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccination has saved millions of lives, they wrote, but falling vaccination rates across the country have led to more frequent outbreaks of devastating diseases such as measles and polio. They also referenced the “rapidly approaching” respiratory virus season, which brings a heavy wave of Covid-19 and flu infections.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply troubled by the repeated false claims about vaccines from too many federal officials, which have contributed directly to these trends,” the public health leaders wrote. “We are equally concerned about recent changes to the recommended childhood and adult immunization schedules that unnecessarily limit access to vaccines.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  voted  last month to recommend against the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children younger than 4, and a new working group will convene to more broadly assess the safety, effectiveness and timing of the shots children and adolescents get, as well as whether  the schedule should be changed .\n \n\n   \n  And at a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump made  numerous false claims  about vaccines given to children, including about the size of vaccine doses and that babies get 82 vaccines in a single shot.\n \n\n   \n  As vaccination becomes increasingly politicized, city health officials say, they felt a need to speak up to protect their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make our public health decisions based on data and not on political ideology,” said Dr. Phil Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “We have to be the voices for that science and reason.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the US Department of Health and Human Services said that vaccines “can be an important tool to prevent disease, especially for the vulnerable.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are restoring the doctor–patient relationship so people can make informed decisions about their health with their providers,” HHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple major medical organizations – including the  American Academy of Pediatrics  and the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  – have broken from the CDC on vaccine guidance. And new  public health organizations have formed  in recent months with an aim to safeguard public health amid turmoil at the federal level.\n \n\n   \n  The Big Cities Health Coalition, with members representing about a fifth of the US population, has been working together to exchange ideas and address public health threats for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  But the “threats are growing and becoming more complicated,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of public health for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina – including from the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of conversation happening about how, in the absence of a strong federal public health system, we are able to navigate and ensure that we continue to protect public safety,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Consistency is important in public health, and the federal structure helped facilitate that, he said. But in the absence of that, coordination becomes key.\n \n\n   \n  A measles outbreak is growing quickly in the upstate region of South Carolina, just about 100 miles from Charlotte.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t have any walls to put up to keep folks from Mecklenburg going into South Carolina, or people from South Carolina going into Mecklenburg County,” Washington said. “So as a country, our local public health system is only as strong as the weakest county or jurisdiction. There is an importance of ensuring that we work collaboratively, because the boundaries that we actually exist in are only administrative.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 unvaccinated students in South Carolina are in quarantine because of a  measles  exposure in school – one of the many reasons why Big Cities Health Coalition emphasizes the importance of vaccination.\n \n\n   \n  Vaccines “keep classrooms safe and schools open. They allow children to spend time with friends and enjoy their favorite activities. They help parents and caregivers work to support their families,” the organizations wrote in the new letter.\n \n\n   \n  Trust also plays a key role in public health, experts say, and city health leaders want to provide reassurance to their communities.\n \n\n   \n  “CDC has been the pinnacle of our public health science up until now. Now it seems more driven by political ideology than actual data and science, so it undermines the trust,” Huang said. “We’re all having to band together and provide that credible data- and science-driven messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  HHS argues it is restoring trust that was lost during the Biden administration’s process for approving Covid-19 vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  “We are restoring that broken trust by empowering HHS’ scientists do their jobs and keeping out the conflicts of interests that plagued vaccine policymaking under Biden,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  But a recent  KFF poll  found that public trust in the CDC is the lowest it’s been since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Only half of adults in the US say they trust the agency to provide reliable vaccine information, down from 57% in July and 63% in September 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite all the chaos and mixed messages, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the health of our communities and making sure the message is clear on the importance of vaccination,” Huang said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/soccer-tel-aviv-derby-police-riots-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:52:00+00:00","title":"Tel Aviv Soccer Derby Canceled by Police Due to 'Violent Riots'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled after violent riots and public disorder at Bloomfield Stadium, with police reporting injuries to 12 civilians and three officers, and nine arrests.

that was caught on body-camera footage.\n \n\n   \n  A jury delivered the verdicts in a courtroom just miles from the Marcy Correctional Facility, where Robert Brooks was pummeled by correctional

“suspicious” hunting stand within sight of the Air Force One landing zone ahead of the president’s arrival in Florida over the weekend, FBI Director Kash Patel said, adding no one was at the stand.\n \n\n   \n  “Prior to the President’s return to West Palm Beach, USSS discovered what appeared to be an elevated hunting stand within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone,” the FBI director  told Fox News Digital , later confirming on social media that  “the FBI is investigating”  what Patel called a “suspicious stand” near the zone.\n \n\n   \n  One senior law enforcement official told CNN the hunting stand was found across from the airport. Based on the condition of the stand, the source said, it had been there for some time.\n \n\n   \n  Hunters regularly set up and leave stands like the one found by law enforcement to use again. These stands are often used by bow hunters – especially in dense, wooded areas – and can be used by individuals hunting with firearms as well.\n \n\n   \n  There is nothing to currently indicate the stand was built to target the president, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The US Secret Service confirmed that teams identified “items of interest” near Palm Beach International Airport during advance security preparations ahead of President Donald Trump’s arrival.\n \n\n   \n  “During advance security preparations prior to the Palm Beach arrival, which included the use of technology and comprehensive physical sweeps, our teams identified items of interest near Palm Beach International Airport,” Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service’s chief of communications, said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no impact to any movements and no individuals were present or involved at the location. While we are not able to provide details about the specific items or their intent, this incident underscores the importance of our layered security measures.

While the glow previously appeared to favor pulsar explanations due to its bulge-like shape, updated models show that dark matter collisions could produce such a shape. This supports the idea that dark matter, particularly WIMPs, might be behind the glow.

What that means \n       \n  By Jacopo Prisco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:28 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At the center of our galaxy, there’s a mysterious, diffuse  glow  given off by gamma rays — powerful radiation usually emitted by high-energy objects such as rapidly rotating or exploding stars.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the glow shortly after launching in 2008, and the light has puzzled scientists ever since, prompting speculation on its cause.\n \n\n   \n  Some astronomers believe the source of the glow to be pulsars — the spinning leftovers of exploded stars — while others point to colliding particles of dark matter, an elusive and invisible form of matter that is believed to be  five times  more abundant than regular matter.\n \n\n   \n   Many studies  have previously found support for  both ideas , but there seemed to be a problem with the dark matter theory: The gamma ray glow appeared to match the shape of the galactic bulge — a crowded, bulbous region at the center of the Milky Way that’s mostly made up of old stars, including pulsars. This observation seemed to support the pulsar theory, with experts theorizing that the glow would have taken a more spherical form if its source were dark matter. However, astronomers haven’t been able to observe enough of the pulsars that would be producing the gamma rays to make a conclusive assessment.\n \n\n   \n  Now, new simulations made using supercomputers show for the first time that dark matter collisions could also have created the bulge-shaped glow, adding weight to the dark matter theory.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in the situation where we have two theories, one posturing dark matter and claiming that it could explain the data we see, another one old stars,” said Joseph Silk, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University and coauthor of a  study  detailing the new findings, published Thursday in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a 50% chance that it might be dark matter at this point, as opposed to the slightly more mundane explanation of old stars, in my opinion.”\n \n\n   \n  Evidence of dark matter would make for a groundbreaking discovery. Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky first theorized dark matter’s existence in the 1930s, and American astronomers Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford confirmed it in the 1970s. They noticed that stars orbiting at the edge of spiral galaxies were moving too quickly to be held together by visible matter and gravity alone, and postulated that there was a large, unseen quantity of matter preventing them from flying apart. Despite decades of effort, scientists have never observed the mysterious substance directly, hence its name.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no question that the nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding major problems in physics,” Silk said. “It’s something that’s everywhere — near us, far from us, and we just don’t know what it is.”\n \n\n   \n    Hunting for WIMPs\n \n\n   \n  There are many hypotheses on what dark matter could be, including remnants of  primordial black holes  or an undiscovered type of particle. Much of the effort to find dark matter has centered on the latter idea, leading to the construction of detectors such as the LZ Dark Matter Experiment in South Dakota.\n \n\n   \n  The instrument is designed to spot one of the  leading dark matter candidates , hypothetical particles called WIMPs —  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles — which don’t absorb light and can pass through regular matter almost seamlessly. Scientists believe that when two WIMPs meet, they annihilate each other and produce gamma rays, which would make them a plausible source of the glow.\n \n\n   \n  Silk’s study used supercomputers to create a map of where dark matter should be in the Milky Way, taking into account how the galaxy originally formed.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem was that all of the models over the past 20 years of the dark matter in our galaxy assume it’s basically like a spherical ball. There is no shape to it, because that was the simplest model,” Silk said.\n \n\n   \n  “Our contribution was, for the first time, to make a real computer simulation of the dark matter distribution. And lo and behold, we found the central part of the dark matter, where the gamma rays would be being emitted, to be, in fact, squashed — more like egg-shaped.” This squashed shape is a close match to the Fermi telescope data, Silk explained.\n \n\n   \n  Luckily, confirmation of the link between dark matter and the glow may not be too far in the offing. A new instrument, the  Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory,  or CTAO, is under construction at two sites — one in Chile and another in Spain — and will start to return data  as soon as 2027 . CTAO will detect gamma rays at a much higher resolution than Fermi, Silk said, making it possible to tell if the gamma rays at the center of the Milky Way are the product of dark matter collisions.\n \n\n   \n  That finding would be a breakthrough in the search for the elusive substance, he added, as well as offer proof that at least some dark matter is made of WIMPs. If, on the contrary, CTAO doesn’t link the glow to dark matter, scientists would be back to square one in the search, with all options still on the table.\n \n\n   \n    A fundamental secret\n \n\n   \n  The study helps reopen the possibility that dark matter could explain the glow at our galactic center, although it doesn’t give new positive evidence in favor of dark matter, said Tracy Slatyer, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with the study. However, she is not convinced that there is a definitive match between the shape of the dark matter distribution and the stellar bulge. “I thought the dark matter hypothesis was still reasonable even before this study,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  This work is further support for the international effort to keep pushing in the hunt for WIMPs, according to Chamkaur Ghag, a professor of physics and astronomy at University College London, who also didn’t participate in Silk’s research. “They remain a most elegant solution to the long-standing dark matter problem,” Ghag added via email, noting that with even more detectors for WIMPs under development, seeing signals of these particles annihilating in space would mean settling the near-century old puzzle of dark matter.\n \n\n   \n  Nico Cappelluti, an associate professor in the department of physics at the University of Miami, said that the Fermi telescope has been a game changer for NASA, and this paper shows that dark matter is still very much in the race to explain the strange glow at the center of our galaxy. “That mystery is alive, and it’s the kind that keeps scientists like me awake at night,” said Cappelluti, who didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Figuring out what dark matter is has been the scientific quest of our century, he added, noting that “WIMPs, these hypothetical particles, have been our prime suspects for years.” The fact that experiments on Earth haven’t caught them yet is frustrating, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “But Fermi gives us a reason to keep believing. This paper reminds us not to cross WIMPs off the list just yet — they might still be lighting up the center of our galaxy,” Cappelluti said. “And if that’s true, we’re closer than ever to uncovering a fundamental secret of the universe.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/07/politics/tariff-revenue-federal-food-aid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00.000-04:00","title":"White House Says It Will Use Tariff Revenue to Fund Federal Food Aid for Mothers and Young Children","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2025 federal government shutdown, the White House announced it would redirect tariff revenue — specifically from Section 32, which supports child nutrition — to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), preventing a collapse of services for nearly 7 million pregnant women, new mothers, and young children.

The National WIC Association has predicted that the program’s funding would last only a week or two into the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the tariff idea in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats are so cruel in their continual votes to shut down the government that they forced the WIC program for the most vulnerable women and children to run out this week,” she wrote. “Thankfully, President Trump and the White House have identified a creative solution to transfer resources from Section 232 tariff revenue to this critical program.”\n \n\n   \n  The tariff money  goes into a general fund  managed by the Treasury Department. But the fund and all the tariff revenue flowing into it is essentially frozen until a bill is passed to fund the government. Congress and Trump could get around that by passing a measure designating the tariff revenue for a specific use.\n \n\n   \n  While the National WIC Association said it welcomes any effort to keep the program operational during the shutdown, it said critical details remain unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “Families need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty,” Georgia Machell, the association’s CEO, said in a statement Tuesday. “We still don’t know how much funding this measure provides, how quickly states will receive it, or how long it will sustain operations.”\n \n\n   \n  At least one budget expert questioned the legality of the Trump administration directing tariff funds to WIC. Lawmakers have not appropriated federal funds to be spent on the program, just as they haven’t for the rest of the discretionary federal budget, Chris Towner, policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem isn’t that they don’t have the money — it’s that Congress hasn’t told them they can spend it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the administration’s authority, a White House spokesperson directed CNN to Leavitt’s post on X.\n \n\n   \n    Bipartisan support\n \n\n   \n  WIC, which has long had bipartisan support, has emerged as a talking point among Republicans on how the shutdown is hurting Americans.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson previously called his Democratic colleagues “shameful” and blamed them for how the government shutdown has impacted WIC.\n \n\n   \n  “What they’ve done by shutting the government down is they have stopped the WIC program,” Johnson said in an interview last week on Newsmax, also citing other programs affected by the impasse.\n \n\n   \n  “All those programs are going to stop. They have stopped now because Chuck Schumer decided to play politics for selfish reasons,” he said, referring to the Senate minority leader. “It’s really shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  Axios first  reported  the White House effort.\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of Donald Trump’s second term, the president has been adding and increasing tariffs on a wide swath of products and countries, which he argues will spur more manufacturing in the US and bolster national security. Tariff collections have totaled  $190 billion  so far this year.\n \n\n   \n  Section 232 tariffs are imposed on national security grounds. Trump has already levied such tariffs on aluminum, steel and cars, for example.\n \n\n   \n    Funding lapse\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture told state agencies last week that due to the lapse in government funding, they will not receive their quarterly allocation of fiscal year 2026 money for WIC, formally known as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.\n \n\n   \n  However, the department said it intends to allocate up to $150 million in contingency funds to state WIC agencies suffering from shortfalls. Also, states can use rebates from infant formula manufacturers, as well as their own funds, according to the USDA guidance obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  WIC helps enrollees purchase infant formula, baby food, cheese, yogurt, bread, peanut butter, fruits, vegetables and other staples, and it provides breastfeeding and nutrition support.\n \n\n   \n  Participation has increased in recent years as federal and state policymakers made it easier to enroll and recertify, improved the shopping experience, and enhanced the benefits. Also, rising inflation,  particularly for food , in recent years has squeezed the budgets of many Americans, especially low-income families.\n \n\n   \n    More federal support needed\n \n\n   \n  Even after the shutdown ends, advocates are concerned about WIC having sufficient funding for the coming fiscal year. Unlike food stamps, federal support for WIC is capped — though Congress has always allocated enough money to provide for all participants.\n \n\n   \n  The program received $7.6 billion in funding for fiscal year 2025, which ended September 30. The pending full-year spending bill in the House would keep funding flat and reduce WIC’s fruit and vegetable benefit, while the version approved by the Senate would provide $8.2 billion for this fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates stress more money is needed this fiscal year to ensure no one is turned away and benefits don’t get cut. Enrollment stood at just under 6.9 million people in May, the most recent month available, up nearly 126,000 from a year earlier and nearly 193,000 from two years ago.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/tech/aws-why-internet-outages-keep-happening","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:28:00-04:00","title":"The internet just had another global outage.

The root cause of Monday’s outage remains unknown, but a service that converts friendly web names into IP addresses was unable to communicate with thousands of companies’ massive databases hosted by Amazon.\n \n\n   \n  Past outages on this scale have been caused by a wide variety of errors, including faulty updates, the accidental injection of bad code, or a change to third-party software that doesn’t play nicely with a service. Rarely, internet cable cuts, cyberattacks or direct denial of service attacks can bring down or overload servers that host key apps.\n \n\n   \n  But the relative frequency of these events shows the lack of necessary redundancies and competitive services. Too often, some internet experts say, companies put all their eggs in one cloud services basket.\n \n\n   \n  There’s “no sign” that this was a cyberattack, according to Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity firm NymVPN, adding that it “looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon’s main data centers.”\n \n\n   \n  “The internet was originally designed to be decentralized and resilient, yet today so much of our online ecosystem is concentrated in a small number of cloud regions,” he said in a note. “When one of those regions experiences a fault, the impact is immediate and widespread.”\n \n\n   \n  Jardin said “these issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down; and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  AWS doesn’t often experience major disruptions like this, with the last  one occurring in 2021 .\n \n\n   \n  “That’s on par with the other major cloud providers and, in fact, it’s amazing that they’re able to run at the scale they do without more frequent disruptions,” said Mike Chapple, a cybersecurity expert and IT professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business.\n \n\n   \n  “The reason these events attract much more notice is because of their impact,” he told CNN. “If a single company experiences an issue in their data center, it causes issues for that company’s products and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the  largest-ever IT outage  brought down large portions of the internet when a devastating CrowdStrike software glitch crashed computers, led to flight cancellations and disrupted hospitals around the globe, creating $5 billion in direct business losses. A bug in CrowdStrike’s cloud-based testing system pushed a problematic update to computers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Also last year,  AT&T’s network went down several times , including an 11-hour meltdown that prevented many gig workers from doing their jobs.\n \n\n   \n    So, what went wrong Monday?\n \n\n   \n  AWS is a cloud computing provider that hosts many of the world’s most-used online services. In Amazon’s infancy, the company needed excess server capacity to ensure it had enough computing power to handle the massive amounts of traffic that came to its site during the holiday season rush. Amazon realized that during the rest of the year, it could use those servers to support other companies’ online needs, and out of that AWS was born.\n \n\n   \n  Among AWS’ many offerings is DynamoDB, a database that hosts information for companies, including customer data. Amazon said Monday that its customers couldn’t access the data stored in DynamoDB, because the Domain Name System (DNS) – a kind of phone book for the internet – had encountered a problem.\n \n\n   \n  DNS is like an internet location engine, converting user-friendly web addresses like amazon.com into IP addresses – a series of numbers that other websites and applications can understand.\n \n\n   \n  “Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data,” said Chapple. “It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear what caused the DNS outage, but it lasted only a few hours. By 6:35 am ET, Amazon had fixed the DNS problem and recommended companies dump their cache – temporary storage files – to help speed up the restoration of their services.\n \n\n   \n  Amazon said the outage continued to affect other AWS services, including EC2 – a kind of virtual server many companies use to build their online applications.\n \n\n   \n  The company will likely conduct a postmortem and explain what went wrong with its DNS system in the coming days.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/entertainment/brandy-monica-chicago-concert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-04:00","title":"Brandy explains why she left Monica all alone on stage","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brandy issued a public apology for abruptly leaving the stage during a Chicago show of her joint tour with Monica, explaining that she suffered from dehydration and a desire to faint after weeks of intense rehearsals.

Gaza appears to have survived its first major test as Israel and Hamas affirmed their commitment to the deal after two Israeli soldiers were killed in the enclave on Sunday, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it would begin a “renewed enforcement” of the ceasefire at the direction of the political echelon.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and its military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades (AQB), said on Sunday morning that they remain committed to the ceasefire and rejected involvement in the attack on Israeli forces.\n \n\n   \n  The stated commitment to the ceasefire comes as the deal’s  key architects , Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, arrived in the region in an effort to push forward the next phase of the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (PMO) said he met with them Monday, on the eve of a visit by US Vice President JD Vance.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration remains focused on implementing the peace agreement and we are working vigorously with our partners to do so. We’re not going to detail ongoing private diplomatic conversations,” a US official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier on Sunday, Israel carried out a series of strikes across Gaza after it accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers – Major Yaniv Kula, 26, and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz – marking the first time Israeli troops have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli strikes killed at least 44 people in several parts of Gaza on Sunday, according to data from Gaza’s hospitals.\n \n\n   \n  Both Hamas and the IDF blamed the other for violating the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Scenes of panic emerged in Gaza during the strikes, where crowds were seen gathered at al-Aqsa hospital as casualties were rushed into the facility.\n \n\n   \n  “We were sitting in a cafeteria, drinking tea and coffee, and suddenly we heard the news — they were hit and bombed, and everyone was killed. That’s all that happened,” Sallih Salman, the brother of one of the deceased Palestinians, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the renewed strikes, the AQB said it found the body of another Israeli hostage during ongoing search operations, “and will hand it over today if field conditions permit.”\n \n\n   \n  The AQB warned that any escalation by the Israeli military would “hinder search, excavation, and the recovery of bodies.”\n \n\n   \n    Aid deliveries continue\n \n\n   \n  Deliveries of aid into Gaza will continue on Monday after Israel announced they would be halted on Sunday, a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The quick announcement of the continuation of aid – only hours after the declared pause – means the deliveries of humanitarian aid may not have been affected.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s continuation of aid is an indication of the goal of maintaining key components of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Hamas. But the Rafah Crossing will remain closed, the official said, as Israel awaits the return of the remaining hostage bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, a UN-backed initiative said parts of Gaza  were facing famine  and the truce raised hopes of a surge in humanitarian aid to the territory.\n \n\n   \n  But Netanyahu faces pressure to respond to any violations from far-right parties supporting his coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, described the resumption of aid as a “shameful backdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “All this on a day when Hamas murdered two IDF soldiers, and continues to violate the agreement and refuses to hand over all the bodies of our fallen,” he  wrote  on X, “Enough of the backdowns.”\n \n\n   \n    Clashes in Rafah\n \n\n   \n  Israel had carried out strikes in Gaza on Sunday after an Israeli military official said Hamas attacked Israeli forces in Rafah in southern Gaza with rocket-propelled grenades and sniper fire.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas fired towards Israeli forces beyond the Yellow Line – the line behind which Israeli troops have withdrawn according to the ceasefire deal – in three separate incidents on Sunday, according to another military official.\n \n\n   \n  The AQB denied knowledge of “any events or clashes” in Rafah and said they are committed to the truce “throughout all areas of the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  While much is unknown about the incident Rafah, it occurred on Sunday morning as Hamas said its internal Rada’a security force was targeting a “hideout” of an Israel-backed militia led by  Yasser Abu Shabab . In June, Israel confirmed it was arming several such militias in an attempt to counter Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said these militias now operate from within Israeli-occupied areas in Gaza from which they “descend on the other half of Gaza, carry out attacks, then go run back to those protected areas.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the ceasefire began last week, Hamas has carried out what it has called a “security campaign” aimed at “collaborators, mercenaries, thieves, bandits, and those cooperating with the Zionist enemy throughout the Gaza Strip.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal clashes have created a volatile security situation in the battered enclave with violence erupting between Hamas and rival groups in several areas across Gaza, including an incident that culminated in an apparent public execution of eight people in a square in Gaza City while large crowds were watching.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s incident brought further strain to the ceasefire, with the next steps still unresolved.\n \n\n   \n  Israel has shot and killed Palestinians it accused of approaching the Yellow Line, in what Hamas has called a “flagrant violation” of the ceasefire commitments. Israel has also accused Hamas of delaying the return of all of the deceased hostages held in Gaza as required by the deal, and has closed a key border crossing until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages in line with the ceasefire agreement with Israel. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information and context. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Dana Karni, Alayna Treene, Sophie Tanno, and Abeer Salman contributed to this story. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/drug-users-guns-owning-supreme-courts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:48:00-04:00","title":"Justices Agree to Review Federal Law Banning Drug Users from Possessing Guns","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to review a federal law that bans certain drug users from possessing firearms, with the case centered on Ali Danial Hemani, a U.S.-Pakistani citizen indicted in 2023 for possessing a gun, marijuana, and cocaine.

John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:48 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide if the federal government may bar certain drug users from owning guns or if the law violates the Second Amendment, taking up a second significant guns case of its current term.\n \n\n   \n  The appeal represents a rare circumstance in which the Trump administration is defending a gun prohibition, which it described in briefing at the Supreme Court as a “narrow” limitation on one of “Americans’ most cherished freedoms.”\n \n\n   \n  The case centers on Ali Danial Hemani, a dual citizen of the United States and Pakistan, who was indicted in 2023 on a single count of violating the guns-and-drugs law after the FBI found a 9mm pistol, 60 grams of marijuana, and 4.7 grams of cocaine at his family home. This prosecution, the government told the high court, rested Hemani’s habitual use of marijuana.\n \n\n   \n  The court will likely hear arguments in the Hemani case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.\n \n\n   \n  A federal district court dismissed the charge, noting a landmark decision from the Supreme Court in 2022 that made it easier for Americans to carry handguns in public and also required similar gun prohibitions to have a connection to history.\n \n\n   \n  But just how closely analogous prosecutors must come to a historic law has been a matter of debate. Last year, for instance, the  Supreme Court upheld a federal law  that bars guns for Americans who are the subject of certain domestic abuse restraining orders, rejecting an argument pressed by gun rights groups that the prohibition violated the Second Amendment.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision, holding in a brief decision that the historical record points only to laws that barred guns for Americans who are actively intoxicated or under the influence of drugs at the time of their arrest. The government, the court ruled, could not target habitual users.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration appealed that decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Habitual illegal drug users with firearms present unique dangers to society – especially because they pose a grave risk of armed, hostile encounters with police officers while impaired,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration laid out a series of allegations against Hemani in its appeal, claiming a search of his phone at the border in 2019 revealed he was prepared to commit fraud at the direction of affiliates of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The government also claimed Hemani traveled to Iran to participate in a celebration of the life of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian official killed in a US drone strike in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  In his response, Hemani argued that the historical support for the federal law is “tenuous at best.” And his attorneys noted that nearly half of US states have legalized recreational marijuana.\n \n\n   \n  “While the number of Americans who use marijuana legally under state law and possess a firearm is unknown, there is certainly a significant overlap between the two,” he argued.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was  convicted in 2024 of the same law  at issue in the Hemani case. He was later  pardoned by Biden  during his final days in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court also agreed to hear a case questioning whether states may bar people from carrying guns on private property – like malls and retail stores – without  permission from the property owner .\n \n\n   \n   This story is breaking and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/harper-lee-short-stories-published-intl-scli","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:11:00-04:00","title":"Harper Lee’s Newly Discovered Short Stories Set to Be Published","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Harper Lee’s long-standing legacy as a singular literary voice is being expanded with the discovery of eight previously unpublished short stories found in her New York apartment after her death.

But today’s prevailing cowboy image also highlights how cultural myths are continuously upcycled and resold, regardless of their origins.\n \n\n   \n  Cowboy-inspired fashion graced October’s issue of Vogue, which featured cover stars  Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid on horses  at a Wyoming ranch. Beyoncé’s  “Cowboy Carter” tour  had thousands two-stepping in their country best. The longstanding Western drama “Yellowstone,” its spinoff “1923” and the Billy Bob Thornton-led “Landman” are among some of the  most-watched TV series . And a wide range of brands including  fast-casual restaurant Sweetgreen  and luxury outerwear brand  Canada Goose  have embraced cowboy hats and rusted-red canyon backdrops in ad campaigns.\n \n\n   \n  “This idea of American patriotism ties into this identity,” said Melynda Seaton, art historian at East Texas A&M University. “And I think now, we’re seeing it more.”\n \n\n   \n    Our ideas about cowboys are divorced from reality\n \n\n   \n  Our collective interest in cowboys can be traced to at least the 1880s, when the Buffalo Bill Wild West shows — a theatrical vaudeville traveling performance — brought romantic and entertaining notions of the West and cowboys to the collective popular culture. Since then, those tropes, popularized by Western films, have reappeared in cycles, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  Singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Western actor John Wayne became synonymous with patriotism, further forging the link between cowboys and American identity. That these connections were cemented during McCarthyism and the Red Scare — a time when the American way was perceived to be under threat — is no accident, Seaton said.\n \n\n   \n  “We started isolating this idea of the cowboy being the epitome of American values,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But pop culture’s depiction of cowboys and the American West is selective.  In ad campaigns, television shows, and even in political discourse, the myth of the cowboy is inherently good, inherently brave, inherently tied to the (American) land. The less glamorous side — the poop shoveled, the low wages — is rarely shown.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things that nobody ever talks about is they only film in the summer for (‘Yellowstone’), because the climate is way too harsh to film in the winter,” Seaton said. “So there’s this weird, only showing the good parts of cowboy culture, but not the bad parts.”\n \n\n   \n  Fashion photographer Richard Avedon exhibited a famous series of portraits from the American West in 1985, having traveled through 17 states and nearly 200 towns  from Texas to Idaho . His portraits poked a hole into the romantic mythology of the American West, telling instead a story of poverty and struggle. A North Dakotan farmer with one arm stares at the camera. A 9-year-old boy in Montana cradles a rifle. A Nebraskan slaughterhouse worker’s white uniform is dyed dark with blood.\n \n\n   \n  The  New York Times  “ripped the exhibition apart,” Seaton said, and many city-dwellers bristled at the harshness of the photos.\n \n\n   \n  Avedon’s portraits are a grim contrast from what we see in old Western films or the fashion and ad campaigns and TV shows of today. The spectacle of the cowboy is so devolved from the actual work of the West, Seaton said, that they exist almost as two separate entities. It is not the actual cowboy that we are interested in; instead, it’s the cowboy costume we have come to mythologize.\n \n\n   \n    Cowboys and the conservative swing\n \n\n   \n  The last time Keegin recalls this level of cowboy costuming was the late 1990s, toward the end of the Clinton administration. “PC culture” was being vilified, she said, and George W. Bush’s Texan twang and plainspoken nature appealed to many.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, there was a pushback against urban-ness and all it has come to represent, Keegin said — liberal values, “elites,” academia, all points still contested today. The cowboy costume’s appeal is in its opposition to that image. As the cowboy image has come to take on these meanings, Republicans’ use of it to gain political favor is  well-documented .\n \n\n   \n  “When we decide that there is ‘real America,’ we tend to buy cowboy hats,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, this rise in cowboy imagery can be attributed in part to the current wave of cultural conservatism, exhibited not just by the Trump administration but by resurging interest in  traditional gender roles  and  conservative social media stars . That resurgence is mirrored in our cultural imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “We are influenced by the politics around us, even if we don’t agree with those politics,” Keegin said. “The aesthetics of those politics influence our choices.”\n \n\n   \n  Arizona native Ben Christensen is a creative director whose work highlights the American West. A recent ad for Zara featured his daughter and her friends dancing in cowboy boots and hats backdropped against the Arizona desert, and he’s brought his signature Western vibe to other campaigns and brands, too. As the cowboy image has become more ubiquitous, Christensen said more companies are capitalizing on its trendiness. Today, the cowboy represents traditional American values, Christensen said: honest, hard working, God-loving and respectful.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very old school, but it’s very refreshing,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Politicians toy with those associations in their own cowboy costuming. Trump, who grew a reputation among some as a  “champion of the common man,”  does not explicitly present himself as a cowboy in the way of Bush or Ronald Reagan. (The latter specifically wore a cowboy hat in campaign materials despite only playing a cowboy on TV.) Yet, historians have noted that his rhetoric and policies play into the individualist and patriotic characteristics associated with the beloved Western cowboy.\n \n\n   \n  “The Trump administration has taken cowboy individualism now to an extreme, I believe, gutting the US government and centering power in a dominant president, while also pulling the United States out of the web of international organizations that have stabilized the globe since World War II,” said historian Heather Cox Richardson during a public lecture at the University of British Columbia  earlier this year .\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s investment in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol — the latter of which has reignited its  recruitment presence at rodeos  — can also be seen as a product of this overarching cowboy imagery, which “feeds a conviction that true men dominate situations, both at home and abroad, with violence,”  Richardson wrote . Just as Hollywood cowboys once defended the American frontier, real ones can now do the same at the American border.\n \n\n   \n    A white-washing in real time\n \n\n   \n  The popular image of the cowboy is not one rooted in the actual history of cowboys — who were originally  Mexican, Native  or  enslaved Black Americans  — but rather in myths perpetuated by entertainment. Yet the role people of color have played in the American West is one that has only recently been highlighted and celebrated.\n \n\n   \n  Black horseback riders during the 2020 George Floyd protests ignited a national dialogue around Black urban cowboys that continued through  heavy media coverage  and, later, photography books and  exhibitions . Beyoncé’s 2024 country album “Cowboy Carter” and the ensuing tour was an albeit  imperfect  education in Black rodeo and country culture. And just two months before the release of “Cowboy Carter,” Louis Vuitton creative director Pharrell Williams  showcased dozens of looks  during Paris Fashion Week inspired by the diversity of the American frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Gabriela Hasbun is the photographer behind “The New Black West,” a book of photography that highlights modern Black cowboys and the Black rodeo, showcasing the current, active role Black Americans play in stewarding cowboy culture. Hasbun has covered the Bill Pickett Rodeo in Oakland, California, since 2007, and she remembers the days when the audience in the stands was sparse, primarily locals and rodeo people there to support the community. Fast forward to 2022, she said, and the rodeo was completely sold out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a very hardworking community that puts a lot of effort in making this rodeo happen,” Hasbun said. “They’ve been doing it since 1984, and only until recently have they been applauded.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, the images and political messages being pushed in 2025 continue to rely on earlier stereotypes of the Western cowboy. Urban cowboy culture and the diversity of the West has never been more known, yet its visibility has been a blip.\n \n\n   \n  “Yet again, we’re seeing a trend be ushered into the zeitgeist by Black Americans and then whitewashed a few years later,” Keegin said.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t concern Kirk Bailey, president of the Oakland Black Cowboy Association, who has seen the interest in cowboys and horseback riding balloon since 2019. The more people learn about cowboy culture and the diversity within it, he said, the more interested they’ll be.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s a trend that’s going to die off anytime soon,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Perpetuated by popular media and politicians alike, the cowboy costume’s current ubiquity is evidence of the image’s grip on the American imagination. While not always a reflection of the true history of real cowboys, its cyclical commercialization is, in its own right, an American tradition.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/louvre-heist-which-jewels-stolen-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-04:00","title":"Historic jewels stolen in ‘national disaster’ for France: What we know about missing Louvre treasures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major 'national disaster' for France, thieves stole nine historically significant artifacts from the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery in Paris, including a sapphire diadem, an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise, and various pieces from Empress Eugénie’s collection.

‘national disaster’ for France: What we know about missing Louvre treasures \n       \n  By Lex Harvey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Precious artifacts  snatched from Paris’s Louvre Museum  Sunday include an emerald necklace set among more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife and other treasures of “inestimable” value.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves targeted the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery on the upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels. In the course of a brisk seven-minute heist, they broke into two high-security display cases and stole nine items, according to France’s culture ministry.  The thieves left on motorcycles, police said. \n \n\n   \n  One item, an ornate gold crown worn by Empress Eugénie, during her reign in the 1800s, was recovered near the scene, the ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Art recovery expert Arthur Brand said the thieves stole important pieces of history in what was a “national disaster” for France.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the crown jewels from Napoleon, his wife and his successors. So these are the natural pride of France,” Brand told CNN. “It’s a great loss.” Because the pieces are so recognizable, he said the thieves will likely dismantle them, sell the jewels and melt down the gold and silver.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what was stolen:\n \n\n   \n    A sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring worn by several queens\n \n\n   \n  This diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland; Marie-Amélie, Queen of the French; and Isabelle d’Orléans, Duchess of Guise is among the items snatched by four thieves during the  7-minute heist. \n \n\n   \n  The diadem — a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty — features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  The origins of the set are unknown, though some suggest it once belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette. While the jewelry bears no hallmarks of the most famous French jewelers of the era, it is indicative of the craftmanship of Parisian artisans of the early 19th century, the museum said. The set stayed with the Orléans family until 1985, when it was acquired by the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n    An emerald necklace and earrings gifted by Napoleon to Marie-Louise\n \n\n   \n  A wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, this ornate set was crafted by the jeweler François-Régnault Nitot includes 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  After Napoleon’s empire collapsed, Marie-Louise bequeathed the original set, which also included a tiara, to a relative, and it was passed through generations of her descendants.\n \n\n   \n  In 1953, the set was sold to jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, after which the emeralds of the tiara were sold and later replaced with turquoise stones by an American collector. The altered tiara is now a part of the Smithsonian collection.\n \n\n   \n  The necklace and earrings, however, were preserved in their original form and sold to the Louvre in 2004 for a reported 3.7 million euros ($4.3 million).\n \n\n   \n    The reliquary brooch\n \n\n   \n  Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the original owner of this  diamond-encrusted brooch,  which was crafted by Paul-Alfred Bapst in 1855 specially for her, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  A Spanish countess, Eugénie was Empress of the French from 1853-1870 and considered one of the most fashionable women of the time.\n \n\n   \n  A reliquary brooch is a brooch that holds a sacred relic, a symbol of Eugénie’s Catholic faith. Comprised of 94 diamonds, the brooch includes the 17th and 18th Mazarin diamonds, which were given to King Louis XIV by former chief minister Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, according to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  These large stones mirror each other at the center of the brooch. Beautiful engravings of foliage and leaves decorate the back of the golden brooch, which was acquired by the Louvre in 1887.\n \n\n   \n    A diamond bow brooch and diadem of Empress Eugénie\n \n\n   \n  The  silver, gold and diamond bow brooch  originally formed the buckle of a diamond belt of 4,000 stones which was exhibited at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, before it was worn by Empress Eugénie, according to the Louvre’s website.\n \n\n   \n  Eugénie is said to have worn the belt, crafted by François Kramer, during a visit by Queen Victoria to the Palace of Versailles in August 1855, and again in June 1856 for the baptism of the Prince Imperial. Eugénie later decided to transform the belt into a brooch and had one of her own jewelers fashion it into a more elaborate standalone piece, adding cascading diamond tassels.\n \n\n   \n  In 1887, the brooch was purchased by jeweler Emile Schlesinger for New York socialite Caroline Astor at auction for 42,200 French francs, according to auction house Christie’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brooch remained in the Astor family for more than a century until the Louvre bought it in 2008, returning the brooch to France. The museum paid 6.72 million euros (more than $10 million at the time) for the brooch,  according to the Fondation  Napoleon . \n \n\n   \n  The pearl diadem was made for Eugénie by jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier in 1853 and contains 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds,  according to the Louvre. \n \n\n   \n    Stolen but recovered: Eugénie’s crown\n \n\n   \n  Thieves attempted to steal Empress Eugénie’s crown, but it was found outside the Louvre, according to France’s culture ministry,\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/us-tomahawk-missile-ukraine-analysis-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:07:00-04:00","title":"US-made Tomahawk is a tried and tested missile – but it’s out of Ukraine’s reach for now","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US-made Tomahawk cruise missile, a proven and effective long-range weapon with a range of up to 2,500 km, remains a key tool in U.S. military operations globally.

It’s been deployed in strikes in Syria and Libya and was used extensively against former dictator Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, in both the 1990s and in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  About 30 of the cruise missiles were used as part of the  US strikes  on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.\n \n\n   \n  While not new, the Tomahawk remains effective and relatively cheap, at $2 million per missile. Depending on the variant, it can strike targets at a range of between 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers (1,000 to 1,600 miles).\n \n\n   \n  That is not much greater than some of Ukraine’s longer-range drones, but the Tomahawk would pack a far higher explosive punch. It has sophisticated guidance technologies and travels at high subsonic (about 550 mph) speeds.\n \n\n   \n  It also flies low, literally hugging the contours of land, making it harder to detect and intercept.\n \n\n   \n  For all these reasons, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lobbied the Trump administration for the delivery of Tomahawks that could enable Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia. For now, at least, he’s not going to get them. Trump made clear last week that the US has few to spare, saying: “We need Tomahawks for the United States of America too. We have a lot of them but we need them.”\n \n\n   \n  As we have seen in this war of attrition – with the F-16 fighter jets, Abrams tanks and even Patriot missile batteries supplied to Ukraine – no single system is a game-changer. Hundreds of Tomahawks would be needed to cripple Russia’s refineries and airbases.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, a few dozen could enable the Ukrainian military to inflict substantial damage on key Russian infrastructure far from its borders – including the  Shahed drone factory  in Tatarstan and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov oblast, according to Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult just to operate with only with Ukrainian drones. We need long-range Tomahawks,” Zelensky said in an interview with US network NBC on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He has also said that Tomahawks would “strengthen Ukraine and force the Russians to sober up a little (and) sit down at the negotiating table.”\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin was so perturbed by the prospect of Kyiv procuring Tomahawks that it issued dire warnings about an escalation of the war, given that the missiles can carry nuclear warheads. Russia would perceive their supply to Ukraine as a “hostile move” that would threaten global security, according to the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to preempt the prospect in a lengthy call with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington on October 16.\n \n\n   \n  The Tomahawk is certainly proven in combat. In 1991, when the US and its allies sought to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, 122 Tomahawks were fired at Iraqi defenses in the opening three days of Operation Desert Storm – the first time they had been used. It has also been used for precision strikes in the Balkans, Afghanistan in 1998, Yemen, Libya and Syria. The latest version of the missile was introduced in 2021, with enhanced electronics and a greater range.\n \n\n   \n  However, it has largely been a sea-launched missile. Ukraine would need a ground-launcher – called the Typhon – to fire the missile.

But its capabilities are something of a mystery and Ukraine lacks the resources to scale up production.\n \n\n   \n  While Tomahawks would help Kyiv’s long-range attacks inside Russia, Ukraine needs above all else more – and more capable – air defenses, as Russia ratchets up mass attacks with a combination of missiles and drones.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky met with US manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Raytheon during his latest trip to Washington as he pursues what he has described as a “mega-deal” worth some $90 billion in weapons purchases.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/baseball-mlb-alcs-blue-jays-mariners-game-6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:22:00-04:00","title":"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hits sixth homer of postseason as Blue Jays dominate Mariners to force ALCS Game 7","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a pivotal Game 6 of the 2025 American League Championship Series, the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-2, forcing a decisive Game 7.

It will be the second Game 7 the Blue Jays have ever played and their first since 1985.\n \n\n   \n  The winner faces the National League champion  Los Angeles Dodgers  in the World Series with Game 1 taking place on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Although Toronto staved off elimination admirably, the Blue Jays were given a helping hand by Seattle’s season-high three errors – two of which came moments apart in the second inning.\n \n\n   \n  First, Julio Rodríguez had a fielding error on a single from Daulton Varsho to left center-field, allowing Varsho to take second base.\n \n\n   \n  The next batter, Ernie Clement, hit a groundball to Mariners third baseman Eugenio Suárez, who ended up losing the ball on the transfer to throw.\n \n\n   \n  Addison Barger and Isiah Kiner-Falefa immediately took advantage with back-to-back RBI singles to open an early 2-0 advantage for Toronto.\n \n\n   \n  “Balls just kind of in and out of the glove there that put a couple extra guys on base,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said, according to  NBC Sports . “Unfortunately, it led to a couple runs.”\n \n\n   \n  Barger doubled the advantage an inning later when he smacked a two-run homer to right center field.\n \n\n   \n  With a 4-0 lead by the bottom of the fifth, up stepped Guerrero Jr.\n \n\n   \n  The slugger’s solo shot to left field was his sixth homer of the playoffs and extended the Blue Jays’ lead to 5-0.\n \n\n   \n  The Mariners eventually got on the board in the sixth after Josh Naylor homered to right field. Randy Arozerana followed with a single that knocked Trey Yesavage out of the game after 87 pitches. Suárez then welcomed reliever Louis Varland with a single down the right-field line to score Arozerana from first base.\n \n\n   \n  But the game was put beyond Seattle’s reach after a wild pitch from Matt Brash in the seventh which allowed Guerrero to score, extending the lead to 6-2 and consequently sending the series to a deciding Game 7.\n \n\n   \n  “Got to enjoy it, man.

bite my arm was done’ \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:28 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Billy Halloran knows the woods well in Myoko,  Japan ; he goes there for regular walks, runs, and even raced an ultramarathon through its rugged wilderness. But two weeks ago, he was running for his life in the same woods – after being attacked by a bear.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran was on one of his routine runs in early October when he saw something he’d never encountered before: two Asiatic black bears.\n \n\n   \n  He   immediately knew he was in trouble. Bear attacks have been  rising across Japan,  with more than 100 people injured so far this year and at least seven killed, the highest since records began in 2006. One recent deadly attack took place just a few miles from where he lives.\n \n\n   \n  Now, he was alone on the trail, kilometers away from where he’d parked his car, contemplating how to escape the two bears staring at him from bushes less than 30 meters away.\n \n\n   \n  When he tried backing away slowly, one bear began moving toward him, said the 32-year-old originally from Auckland, New Zealand. “It was around my size, it was an adult, it was at least 60 or 70 kilos (about 132 to 154 pounds),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Halloran decided not to run, afraid it would chase and jump onto him from behind. So instead, he tried to scare it off by shouting. “I could see it was going to lunge at me – and it did.”\n \n\n   \n  He held up his arm in front of his face, “and it grabbed my arm, and I got pushed to the ground,” Halloran said.\n \n\n   \n  “Then in one bite, my arm was done.”\n \n\n   \n  The bear then attacked his leg, leaving claw punctures and scratches, before it backed off. Running on adrenaline, Halloran managed to get up, then engaged in a brief “standoff” with the bear – before it disappeared back into the bush.\n \n\n   \n  Terrified it might come back, Halloran called his wife to come and pick him up. With a broken arm and badly injured leg, he managed to run a kilometer to meet her and wait for an ambulance.\n \n\n   \n  He spoke to CNN from the hospital where he’s been recovering for the past two weeks, having had three surgeries – including a hip graft to cover a chunk of bone that had been bitten off, and the insertion of metal plates into his arm.\n \n\n   \n  A long road of recovery still awaits, including physical rehabilitation. After his last ultramarathon, he’d been hoping to train for more races – and still plans to – but knows it won’t be the same as before.\n \n\n   \n  A bigger challenge might be facing the lingering trauma of the attack, which he compared to “how someone getting attacked by a shark might feel like trying to go back surfing.”\n \n\n   \n  But he’s determined to get back to running in the woods, crediting the local community of runners that have supported him throughout his recovery. And he feels fortunate, he said, because “there’s been a lot of attacks, and some people haven’t been so lucky.”\n \n\n   \n  In recent months, other bear incidents have included bears rampaging through a supermarket, loitering outside a nursery, and severely mutilating a man while he was cleaning an outdoor bath.\n \n\n   \n   Experts say bears  are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.\n \n\n   \n  In response to this deadly surge, the Japanese government announced on Friday that it will take tougher measures to control the bear population.\n \n\n   \n  Many residents take precautions like carrying bells or blasting music out loud to scare away bears. Next time, Halloran said he might consider carrying bear spray.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just a bit more cautious about what I’m going to be doing,” he said. But, he quipped, winter is arriving soon – and once he heals, he’s looking forward to “some snowboarding and (getting) the mental state back a little bit more, and (getting back) into nature.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/middleeast/hamas-gaza-israeli-hostage-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:19:00-04:00","title":"Twelfth Deceased Hostage Identified After Two Returned to Israel Overnight, Kibbutz Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the body of Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, one of 28 deceased hostages, was identified after being returned by Hamas to Israel, marking the 12th confirmed body returned under a ceasefire agreement that began in late 2025.

Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The body of a twelfth hostage returned to Israel from Gaza has been identified Sunday as Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri, as the ceasefire that brought a pause to two years of destruction in the Palestinian enclave comes under strain.\n \n\n   \n  A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Sunday said Oakkharasri’s remains had been identified and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed his family. His was one of two bodies returned by Hamas on Saturday to Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The other body was earlier identified as that of hostage Ronen Engel, according to his kibbutz, and photographs provided to CNN by his family.\n \n\n   \n  Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over the bodies of Engel and Oakkharasri to the Red Cross on Saturday, after which they were transferred to Israel for formal identification.\n \n\n   \n  “Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the return for burial of our beloved Ronen Engel,” a spokesperson for the kibbutz said in a statement. “We will always remember Ronen as a devoted family man, incurably optimistic, with a sense of humor, a joy for life, and a constant smile.”\n \n\n   \n  Oakkharasri was a Thai citizen who was taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 7, 2023. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in May 2024 that Oakkharasri was presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n  Engel was 54 when he was killed, and his wife Karina kidnapped along with their daughters Mika and Yuval. His wife and children were released the following month, but Engel’s body was not.\n \n\n   \n  The truce in Gaza appears to be largely holding as it enters its second week, but has come under pressure from the delayed return of the remaining hostage bodies from Gaza, the initially slow entry of aid into the enclave, and Israel’s continued deadly strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The US State Department said Saturday that “credible reports” indicate Hamas is planning an “imminent ceasefire violation” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,” the media note said. “The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.”\n \n\n   \n  “Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  In response, Hamas said in a statement Sunday that it “reaffirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement” and “stresses that (Israel) continues to breach the agreement and fabricate flimsy pretexts to justify its crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the State Department’s memo.\n \n\n   \n  With the handover late on Saturday, Hamas has returned 12 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, which went into effect last week. All 12 have now been formally identified.\n \n\n   \n  “We will not rest and we will not be silent until the last of the hostages is returned,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Protests have ignited in Israel as frustration  intensifies  over the delay in returning the bodies of the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square, large crowds of demonstrators gathered on Saturday, urging the government to pressure Hamas to release the bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has  said  that it handed over all of the hostage remains that it could access and that “extensive efforts and special equipment” would be needed to retrieve more. Israeli intelligence has  assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Israel believes  that Hamas  does know the locations of some of the deceased hostages it claims are missing, according to two Israeli sources familiar with the matter. Israel’s foreign minister has accused Hamas of trying to use the hostages’ bodies as leverage.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to Channel 14 on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would end once all of the hostage bodies have been returned and Hamas is demilitarized.\n \n\n   \n  “The war in Gaza will finally end when the terms of the agreement that was supposedly accepted are implemented, and this includes, first of all, Phase A - the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Phase B also includes the disarmament of Hamas, or rather the disarmament of the Strip, and before that the disarmament of Hamas.”\n \n\n   \n    Rafah crossing and crucial aid\n \n\n   \n  As the dispute continues, the Rafah crossing will remain closed until further notice, Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday. The crossing is a  crucial link  between Egypt and Gaza, serving as the enclave’s lifeline for humanitarian aid.\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu’s office said that its opening would be dependent on how “Hamas fulfills its part in returning the hostages and implementing the agreed-upon outline.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamas criticized the delayed reopening of the crossing as “a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.” The group also condemned Israel’s strikes on Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli military targeted a vehicle carrying 11 civilians, including several women and children, on Friday after it crossed a line that marks Israel’s control under the ceasefire agreement, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  After coordinating with the United Nations, the Civil Defense recovered on Saturday nine bodies, including those of four children and three women. The bodies of two other children are missing, the Civil Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli military told CNN its troops “fired warning shots” after a “suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line” – a reference to the initial Israeli withdrawal line. The military said the “vehicle continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/diwali-festival-of-lights-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:59:00-04:00","title":"It’s Diwali, a time for light, community and fresh starts","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated globally by over a billion Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists on October 20, 2025.

\nUpdated: \n        8:59 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More than a billion Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists around the world are celebrating  Diwali , the festival of lights, on October 20, 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Diwali, also called Deepavali, is one of the  biggest festivals in India . It’s also widely celebrated in Nepal, Malaysia, Fiji and other countries with large South Asian diasporas. Homes, businesses and public spaces are lit up with diyas, or oil lamps made from clay, and fireworks displays abound. People gather with their families, eat sweets and exchange gifts.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its deep religious significance, Diwali today is also a  cultural festival observed by people regardless of faith .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the holiday.\n \n\n   \n    What is Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali comes from the Sanskrit word deepavali, meaning “row of lights.”\n \n\n   \n  It marks the triumph of light over darkness, of good over evil. Though Diwali traditions vary according to region and religion, the myths and historical stories behind the holiday share themes of justice and liberation.\n \n\n   \n    When is Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali is celebrated every year in autumn, usually falling between October and November. The festival lasts five days, with the main celebration occurring on the third day. This year, Diwali will be observed on October 20.\n \n\n   \n  These are the  five days of Diwali :\n \n\n   \n  •  Dhanteras : People typically mark the first day of Diwali by purchasing gold and silver jewelry, utensils and other new household items for good luck. Many clean their homes to invite the blessings of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Others also honor  Dhanvantari , the god of Ayurveda, and Yamaraj, the god of death, on this day.\n \n\n   \n  •  Choti Diwali , or  Naraka Chaturdashi : The second day of Diwali marks Lord Krishna’s  defeat of the demon king Narakasura . People wake up early to bathe and wash their hair. They also clean their homes, decorate them with rangolis and diyas and prepare sweets.\n \n\n   \n  •  Diwali,  or  Lakshmi Puja : The third day of the festival is what people typically think of as  Diwali . Families gather to exchange gifts, feast on scrumptious dishes and indulge in sweets. Many Hindus worship the goddess Lakshmi on this day.\n \n\n   \n  •  Padwa , or  Govardhan Puja : The fourth day of Diwali honors the relationship between husband and wife, and husbands will typically buy a gift for their spouses. In some traditions, it commemorates the day Lord Krishna lifted  Govardhan Hill  to protect villagers of Vrindavan from rains brought on by Lord Indra’s anger. Some devotees offer a mountain of food to Krishna in remembrance, while others make clay and cow dung figures recreating the event.\n \n\n   \n  •  Bhai Dooj : The final day of Diwali celebrates  the love between siblings , in honor of the bond between Lord Yama and his sister Yami (or Yamuna). Sisters will sometimes place a tilak, or red mark, on their brothers’ foreheads, while brothers will give gifts to their sisters.\n \n\n   \n    What is the meaning of Diwali?\n \n\n   \n  Diwali is largely observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists, but much like Christmas, the holiday transcends religion and is now celebrated by many people outside those traditions.\n \n\n   \n  The meaning of the festival varies by community and region.\n \n\n   \n  One of the legends at the heart of Diwali comes from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. During the exile of Prince Rama (an incarnation of the god Vishnu) and his wife Sita (an incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi), Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana. Rama ultimately defeats Ravana to rescue his wife. For some Hindus, Diwali marks Rama and Sita’s triumphant  return to their kingdom after 14 years of exile .\n \n\n   \n  Some Hindus in southern India celebrate Lord Krishna’s defeat of Narakasura, which led to the rescue of  16,000 girls  in the demon’s captivity. In western India, Diwali  commemorates the day  that Lord Vishnu banishes the demon king Bali to rule the netherworld.\n \n\n   \n  Sikhs commemorate the occasion as “ Bandi Chhor Divas ” (The Day of Liberation), which will be observed on October 21 this year.   It marks the day that Guru Hargobind, their sixth guru, and 52 Hindu kings were  freed from wrongful imprisonment . The Mughal Emperor Jahangir initially only agreed to release Guru Hargobind, but the guru refused to go without the royals. After Jahangir declared that those who could hold onto the guru’s cloak could leave, Guru Hargobind tied 52 tassels to his cloak so that each ruler could walk to freedom.\n \n\n   \n  For Jains, Diwali signifies the day  Lord Mahavira , their last spiritual leader, attained physical death and achieved enlightenment. Some Buddhists acknowledge Diwali as the day the  Emperor Ashoka  embraced Buddhism.\n \n\n   \n    How is Diwali celebrated?\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the common traditions of decorating one’s home, setting off firecrackers and feasting on delicious food, there are several other ways that people mark Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  In some parts of India, people play gambling card games such as teen patti, blackjack and poker. Gambling during the holiday is considered auspicious, stemming from a legend in which the  god Shiva and his consort Parvati play a dice game .\n \n\n   \n  Diwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year, and many businesses, traders and shopkeepers open new accounts books during the holiday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/basketball-nba-british-players-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"08:13:00-04:00","title":"The NBA is at its international peak, but British players are still struggling to break through","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite basketball being the second most popular team sport in the UK with over 1.5 million weekly participants and growing NBA fandom, British players remain underrepresented in the NBA.

At the start of the 2024-25 season, the league announced that a record-tying  125 international players  were on opening night rosters.\n \n\n   \n  Those 125 players came from 43 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Cameroon and Serbia.\n \n\n   \n  Fast-forward to the 2025 NBA draft. Behind the flashing lights and celebratory fireworks surrounding top prospects  Cooper Flagg , Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey was an underappreciated, perhaps even more compelling story of an international player waiting for his big chance.\n \n\n   \n  As social media buzzed through the first round and beyond, Amari Williams waited patiently in the wings. The former University of Kentucky center from Great Britain, far removed from the bright lights, wasn’t your standard international draftee story.\n \n\n   \n  So when he was  selected  by the 18-time NBA champion Boston Celtics midway through the second round, it was more than just a personal triumph – it was a win for British basketball on the world’s biggest stage.\n \n\n   \n  Born and raised in Nottingham, a mid-sized city two hours north of London in England’s East Midlands ,  Williams became just the sixth homegrown British player to be drafted to the NBA in the last 25 years, according to  Hoopsfix .\n \n\n   \n  Following a five-year college stint – playing for Drexel University in the first four and finishing his collegiate career as a Kentucky Wildcat – the  seven-foot center  was drafted by the Orlando Magic, who subsequently traded his draft rights to the Celtics. Boston then signed Williams  to a two-way contract  in mid-August.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a great feeling,” the 23-year-old told  CNN Sports . “They (the Celtics) won it recently, the players they’ve got, all the older guys – I want to adapt and learn as much as I can this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The best thing is there’s no better players to learn from,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Although Williams’ journey has been a successful one, it has by no means been simple. At the age of 16, he moved 118 miles from Nottingham to an agricultural boarding college in rural northwest England, the only place where Williams could pursue basketball full-time.\n \n\n   \n  “We were essentially living on a farm, going from a city like Nottingham to living in the countryside was very different,” Williams said about his upbringing.\n \n\n   \n  Like many British hoopers, Williams had little opportunity to showcase his talents because basketball-dedicated spaces in good condition are few and far between in the United Kingdom. And even when those spaces are available, they are often used for several different competing sports.\n \n\n   \n  “Not a lot of people were able to train as much,” Williams said. “When I moved to Preston, we were able to train, but it’s tough when you have to share with badminton and other sports.”\n \n\n   \n  The average NBA consumer will point towards the likes of San Antonio Spurs power forward Jeremy Sochan or London-born New York Knicks forward OG Anunoby as the association’s British representation.\n \n\n   \n  But the Oklahoma-born Sochan spent half of his high school life in the US, despite growing up in Milton Keynes, and Anunoby swapped the English capital for Missouri at the age of four.\n \n\n   \n  Over 1.5 million people play basketball weekly across the UK and it has grown to be the country’s second most popular team sport in recent years, according to  Sport England’s  2024 Active Lives survey.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, NBA fandom among adults in Britain has grown by 24% since 2022, according to the  UK Government .\n \n\n   \n  So why, despite popularity at a recreational level, are there so few British NBA players?\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lack of direction in the UK,” Knicks forward Tosan Evbuomwan, who was born and raised in Newcastle – a large metropolitan city in northeast England – told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “There haven’t been many guys that have progressed through the UK and play at the top levels, so there’s not many people to give you direction. You have to figure it out yourself a lot of the time, to be honest.”\n \n\n   \n  Evbuomwan experienced that lack of direction from the start of his basketball journey. At the age of 15, with no school team in place, he and a group of friends took it upon themselves to create one.\n \n\n   \n  Although it was his first time playing “organized” basketball, there was no organization about it at all: no coaches, no formal training, just a shared desire to play the game. Together, they coached each other and played in their own tournaments.\n \n\n   \n  After impressing at his first competition, Evbuomwan was scouted by the Newcastle Eagles academy team before being offered a scholarship to play Division One basketball at Ivy League school Princeton University in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Four years of hard work – in which Evbuomwan won Ivy League Player of the Year and was a two-time first-team All-Ivy League selection – resulted in two-way contracts from 2023 onwards with the Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Brooklyn Nets and now the Knicks.\n \n\n   \n  Although the British point guard turned small forward has come a long way on his basketball journey, he never forgets the hardships of where he came from.\n \n\n   \n  “I can probably count on one hand how many shooting guns there are in the whole of the UK,” the 24-year-old chuckled, referring to a specific type of shooting machine used in drills.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and my friends used to play all the time: one-on-one, two-on-two. I didn’t know we were supposed to get shots up and work on movements.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting shots up was the simplest, most basic thing in terms of practice and basketball and I didn’t know to do that at all – and I’m sure I wasn’t alone.”\n \n\n   \n  To be an aspiring British basketball player is to live with hopes and dreams that may never be fulfilled. And despite the game’s immense popularity, the sport is in the grips of a governance crisis in the UK.\n \n\n   \n  On October 14, global basketball governing body FIBA  temporarily suspended  the British Basketball Federation (BBF) and banned the British men’s national team from playing in FIBA senior competitions.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came after the basketball authority established a taskforce in August to investigate and address “apparent governance issues and regulatory non-compliance” within British men’s club competitions.\n \n\n   \n  An  ongoing dispute  between the BBF, a group of investors and teams in the UK’s current professional league (Super League Basketball), has reached Britain’s High Court with an initial hearing set for July 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement , the BBF said that it is committed to “restoring, confidence, transparency and sustainability within the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has reached out to the BBF for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the turmoil in the British professional game, work is being done at the grassroots level to nurture the sport.\n \n\n   \n  In September, the UK government announced that basketball will benefit from a joint £10 million (roughly $13.4 million) investment at a recreational level.\n \n\n   \n  A  press release  from the government reported that £5 million will be committed to basketball in 2026/27, with the NBA matching that investment with their own funding of £5 million through to 2028. The joint investment plans to bring the game to communities up and down the country.\n \n\n   \n  “Basketball is booming in Britain – and this investment will help take it to the next level, opening up the game to thousands more people right across the country,” said UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about more than sport – it’s about community, inclusion and inspiring the next generation to find their spark.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite work being done on the recreational level, without a well-organized system currently in place to help nurture talent at the top level, there are few pioneers that the next generation can look up to.\n \n\n   \n  But rather poetically, Williams cites Evbuomwan as someone who inspired him on his NBA journey.\n \n\n   \n  “In my age group, or around my age, Tosan was the first to do it and be able to make the NBA,” said Williams.\n \n\n   \n  “From playing in Newcastle and going to Princeton, seeing him do it has inspired me and a lot of other people to take that path.”\n \n\n   \n  Ideally, that path becomes more attainable as time goes on, giving aspiring British talent more stars to look up to when they do get shots up.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I can do to help him and the younger generation, I’ll always be there,” Evbuomwan said of mentoring Williams.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and Amari have a real relationship and that only helps the situation. In the same way, me and Sochan talk and he’s helped me – being here a year longer, that experience really does matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/abortion-politics-democrats-virginia-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Are Talking About Abortion on the Campaign Trail Again","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 U.S. off-year elections, Democrats are re-emphasizing abortion rights as a core campaign issue, especially in Virginia and other key states, despite a broader focus on economic affordability.

In Pennsylvania, where three state Supreme Court justices are facing  a retention vote , Democrats are pointing to abortion as one of the issues at stake. And in California, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are part of the coalition backing a ballot initiative to enact a  Democratic gerrymander  in response to Republican mid-cycle redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been a lot of armchair politics talk from so-called pundits about whether or not the party is talking too much about social issues, not about economic issues,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, which is investing $5 million into 2025 races. “We’re not seeing it that way, and I don’t think any candidates who are actually running see it that way either.”\n \n\n   \n  If Virginia Democrats maintain control of the House of Delegates this year — the state Senate is not up for election — they will aim to create a ballot measure next year enshrining abortion rights into the state Constitution.\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Republicans will be able to neutralize the issue to the extent Donald Trump did during his race against Kamala Harris. The president, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who struck Roe v. Wade, said during the 2024 campaign that he would leave abortion policy “to the states.”\n \n\n   \n  “If there were more single-issue, pro-choice voters, Kamala Harris would be president and the Democrats would control the Senate and the House,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who previously worked with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n \n\n   \n  Since taking office, Trump  stopped Medicaid funding  from going to Planned Parenthood and federal health regulators have opened a study into the safety of  the abortion drug mifepristone , raising concerns among abortion-rights advocates that the US might impose new limits on drugs used by women in states that ban or sharply restrict abortion.\n \n\n   \n  Those advocates say there’s still an opportunity to contrast the positions of the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be a mistake to learn the wrong lessons of 2024,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center Action Fund.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats talk about abortion rights and affordability\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger has spent most of her campaign running on affordability, including her plans to reduce health care, housing and energy costs.\n \n\n   \n  But of the $11 million she’s spent on TV ads this year, $1.1 million has gone toward ads in the last 30 days on Earle-Sears’ abortion stance, according to data from media tracking firm AdImpact.\n \n\n   \n  In a new digital ad for Spanberger, former President Barack Obama ties the race to abortion, saying Republicans “will keep attacking abortion rights and the rights of women.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s campaign said in a statement that her “focus remains on addressing” voters’ concerns over high costs and the impact of funding cuts enacted by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “But as we approach the first Virginia gubernatorial election since the fall of Roe, it’s also important for Virginians to know that Winsome Earle-Sears has a long record of opposing reproductive rights for Virginia women,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  A recent Christopher Newport University poll found that abortion was not a top issue for voters, whose top three priorities were threats to democracy, inflation and immigration. But voters said they trusted Spanberger on reproductive rights issues over Earle-Sears by a 20-point margin. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 10 percentage points in the poll.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s running mates have also leaned into abortion as a campaign issue against their opponents, who have backed restricting access.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not solely about abortion,” said Virginia Democratic Party Chair Lamont Bagby. “It’s about protecting Virginian rights.”\n \n\n   \n  Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general candidate facing condemnation over texts in which he fantasized about the shooting of a legislative colleague, is running an ad featuring a woman who had an abortion. His ad aims to portray Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection, as an “anti-abortion extremist.”\n \n\n   \n  Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic candidate for Virginia lieutenant governor, has spoken on the campaign trail about difficult pregnancies she experienced, including two that resulted in miscarriages.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s the right that we are trying to protect for all women, given the complexity and the very, very personal nature of medical care,”  Hashmi, a Virginia state senator, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans try to neutralize abortion access as an issue\n \n\n   \n  Both Earle-Sears and New Jersey’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Jack Ciattarelli — who is running a competitive race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill — have tried to downplay abortion. A spokesperson for Earle-Sears’ campaign said her comments at the  gubernatorial debate  earlier this month reflect her view on the issue.\n \n\n   \n  “My position is that the commonwealth needs to come together and figure out where it wants to be,” Earle-Sears said this month. “It’s not going to be my view. It’s going to be a view of the majority.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli has said he supports a woman’s right to choose, though he has voted in the past to limit funding to Planned Parenthood.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is the only Southern state  that has not restricted  abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In 2023, Gov. Glenn Youngkin hoped to win complete Republican control of the state legislature by boosting candidates running on a 15-week abortion restriction, which he described as a compromise. Instead, Democrats maintained control of the state Senate and flipped the GOP-held House of Delegates.\n \n\n   \n  Miyares, Virginia’s attorney general, said he backs exceptions to abortion bans in the case of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “Virginia voters will decide this issue directly next year, and Attorney General Miyares will enforce the law they impose, dispassionately and faithfully, as he always has,” a campaign spokesperson said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  John Reid, Hashmi’s opponent for Virginia lieutenant governor, suggested on a recent podcast appearance that the state was at risk of becoming a destination for “abortion tourism.”\n \n\n   \n  Reid said in a statement that he would want to debate Hashmi on abortion and other issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I would enjoy the opportunity to join Ghazala on the debate stage to discuss the troubling reality that Virginia’s laws have made it an outlier in the region,” he wrote, adding he wants to focus on expanding support for women’s health care and young families.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/plane-slides-off-runway-hong-kong-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00.000-04:00","title":"Two killed as cargo plane skids off runway into the sea in Hong Kong","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Boeing cargo plane operated by Turkish cargo carrier ACT Airlines skidded off the runway at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) early Monday, October 19, 2025, after landing from Dubai.

forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snighda Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking. This is compounded by the reduction of Simran’s agency to the singular goal of marrying her beloved, leaving her own personal ambitions completely unexplored.\n \n\n   \n  “What does she do? What are her work ambitions?” Sur said. “I want to know more about what she’s studying, where she wants to work.”\n \n\n   \n  For Anupama Chopra, the whole idea of Simran “being parceled between lover and father” is equally frustrating. “But every film is a product of its time,” she said. “And I can tell you at the premiere, none of us thought there was any problem with it because we didn’t know any better. We were swept by the romance.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Maratha Mandir, crowds casually trickle in, well into the film’s three-hour runtime.\n \n\n   \n  It’s clear that most have seen the movie before, yet when a big moment arrives, phones go up to capture it for social media as cheers erupt with a joy that feels brand new.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in one of the back rows, the diamond worker Shedge takes it all in.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as I’m alive and until my last breath,” he said. “I’ll keep watching this film.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/americas/bolivia-election-results-rodrigo-paz-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:25:00-04:00","title":"Centrist Rodrigo Paz wins Bolivian presidency, ending nearly 20 years of leftist rule","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Centrist Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia’s presidential runoff election, defeating conservative Jorge ‘Tuto’ Quiroga, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist rule by the Movement to Socialism (MAS).

Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, as the country’s worst economic crisis in a generation helped propel the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule.\n \n\n   \n  Paz, a senator from the Christian Democratic Party, won 54.5% of the vote, beating Quiroga’s 45.5%, according to early results from Bolivia’s electoral tribunal. But Paz’s party does not hold a majority in the country’s legislature, which will force him to forge alliances to govern effectively.\n \n\n   \n  The new president takes office on November 8.\n \n\n   \n  The 58-year-old senator’s win marks a historic shift for the South American country, governed almost continuously since 2006 by Bolivia’s Movement to Socialism, or MAS, which once enjoyed overwhelming support from the country’s Indigenous majority.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s moderate platform — pledging to maintain social programs while promoting private sector-led growth — appeared to resonate with left-leaning voters disillusioned by the ruling MAS, founded by former President Evo Morales, but wary of Quiroga’s proposed austerity measures.\n \n\n   \n  Support for MAS cratered in the August first round amid a  deepening economic crisis .\n \n\n   \n  “This election marks a political turning point,” said Glaeldys Gonzalez Calanche, analyst for the Southern Andes at International Crisis Group. “Bolivia is heading in a new direction,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Both runoff candidates pledged to strengthen diplomatic ties with Washington — strained since 2009 — and seek US-backed financial support to stabilize Bolivia’s fragile economy.\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Paz unveiled plans for a $1.5 billion economic cooperation deal with US officials to ensure fuel supplies.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that both presidential candidates “want stronger, better relations with the United States,” after decades of anti-American leadership. “This election is a transformative opportunity,” he said on October 15.\n \n\n   \n  Outside a polling station in La Paz, Lourdes Mendoza said she had grown weary of the MAS era. “My children were born and raised with a single government,” she said. “I hope they can see other possibilities and alternatives.”\n \n\n   \n    Voters want economic change\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s fragile economy dominated the runoff campaign. Once plentiful natural gas exports have plummeted, inflation is at a 40-year high, and fuel is scarce.\n \n\n   \n  Both candidates campaigned to roll back elements of the MAS era, state-led model, but differed over how drastically. Paz favored gradual reform, including tax incentives for small businesses and regional fiscal autonomy, while Quiroga proposed sweeping cuts and an IMF bailout.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going for a new stage of Bolivian democracy in the 21st century,” Paz told Reuters two days before the election at his family’s ranch in the southern gas-producing region of Tarija.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to try to build an economy for the people,” he said, one where “the state is no longer going to be the central axis.”\n \n\n   \n  Some voters said they were not convinced that his victory represented a true break from MAS: “I think he’s a puppet of the outgoing government,” said 21-year-old Esther Miranda from La Paz, who works in a nail salon.\n \n\n   \n    Running mate’s populist appeal boosts Paz\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s campaign was boosted by his running mate Edman Lara, a former police officer known for viral TikTok videos exposing corruption. Lara’s populist appeal helped Paz connect with younger and working-class voters, analysts said.\n \n\n   \n  Economists warn the incoming administration faces immediate challenges, including securing fuel supplies and building coalitions in a fragmented legislature.\n \n\n   \n  Outgoing hydrocarbons minister Alejandro Gallardo said last week that the state energy company was struggling to obtain foreign currency for fuel imports.\n \n\n   \n  Paz told Reuters he was already addressing the issue through deferred payment agreements with fuel suppliers to ensure diesel and gasoline arrive within days of his inauguration.\n \n\n   \n  Paz said he would also begin phasing out universal fuel subsidies. Targeted support would go to vulnerable groups, while bigger industries such as agribusiness would pay market rates for fuel.\n \n\n   \n  “The market will have to adjust prices, but there are sectors that will have government support until the economy is reactivated,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Bolivia’s main labor union, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), has previously warned it would oppose any threats to the social and economic gains achieved so far, in a sign of the juggling act for Paz’s government to avoid street protests.\n \n\n   \n  Paz’s PDC won 49 of 130 seats in the lower house and 16 of 36 in the Senate, just ahead of Quiroga’s coalition, which secured 43 seats in the lower house and 12 in the Senate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/sport/nfl-buccaneers-doug-martin-dies","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:40:00.000-04:00","title":"Former Buccaneers All-Pro Running Back Doug Martin Dies at 36","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Doug Martin, a former All-Pro running back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a standout college player from Boise State, died at the age of 36.

October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he’s acting as a king.\n \n\n   \n  But Donald Trump and his entourage responded with mockery to weekend  “No Kings” protests  by millions of Americans — embracing the narrative in a way that explains his growing hubris and belief that he has unchecked power.\n \n\n   \n  The president and Vice President JD Vance this weekend both posted AI memes to social media depicting Trump in a crown. The  one Trump shared  was a mocked-up vision of the president flying a fighter jet emblazoned with “KING TRUMP” appearing to dump raw sewage on protesters. In Vance’s  troll on Bluesky , a site popular with liberals, prominent Democrats knelt as supplicants in a royal court before Trump, the divine and absolute ruler.\n \n\n   \n  It was a clever political trick. MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters’ gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He’s far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don’t agree with. Presidents  Barack Obama  and  Joe Biden , as well as 2016 Democratic nominee  Hillary Clinton , all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump’s rise to power.\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  But the president’s social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren’t for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don’t again rule America. He’s implying there’s no room for those who don’t support him and showing he’s willing to force them into line. \n \n\n   \n  Whether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a  government shutdown  the president appears to have no desire to end.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more  universities refusing to bend  to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.\n \n\n   \n  The president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday’s mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n     “When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s latest monarchical moves\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.\n \n\n   \n  His stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of  former Rep. George Santos , who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president’s latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This  followed his demands  that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were  followed by indictments  scant weeks later.\n \n\n   \n  Santos on Sunday related to CNN’s Dana Bash how he’d been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,”  Santos said , “I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos’ former GOP colleague from New York,  said of Santos : “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”\n \n\n   \n  Pardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump’s treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system’s reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)\n \n\n   \n  The president’s authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.\n \n\n   \n  ► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a  seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean  that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump’s promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration’s unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress’ authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I’m not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn’t do this by himself.”\n \n\n   \n  ► Trump last week detailed his decision  to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela , prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump  stoked speculation  of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won’t be done nicely.”\n \n\n   \n  Curtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump’s methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America’s global reputation. His administration’s refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The saga is unfolding as Hegseth’s Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration’s  draconian new press regulations . The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration’s determination to  deploy troops  on  American soil .\n \n\n   \n    Protesters challenge the administration’s dismissal of demonstrations\n \n\n   \n  Trump aides tried to  diminish and defame  the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party’s constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”\n \n\n   \n  There is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president’s vulgar social media posts mocked them.\n \n\n   \n  “We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”\n \n\n   \n  In time, Saturday’s protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump’s first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.\n \n\n   \n  At the least, they show that while many of Trump’s supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don’t.\n \n\n   \n  And while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a  warning by Obama on Marc Maron’s final  podcast that it wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We’re not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.\n \n\n   \n  Organizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.\n \n\n   \n  Retired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n \n\n   \n  Asked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/china/china-fourth-plenum-ccp-meeting-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"11:28:00-04:00","title":"Roiled by purges and buffeted by US frictions, China’s leadership meets to chart country’s rise","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chinese leader Xi Jinping is convening the fourth plenum of the Communist Party to present and refine China’s next five-year economic plan (2026–2030), emphasizing technological innovation in AI, quantum computing, and new energy amid growing tensions with the United States.

11:28 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping is convening a key political meeting this week where he will push forward his next five-year strategy to strengthen the  world’s second-largest economy  in the face of mounting friction with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The gathering, known as the fourth plenum, provides an opportune moment for Xi to showcase China’s brand of highly choreographed economic planning and his tight control over its political apparatus, days before a potential meeting with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  It also underscores the sharp contrast between the two countries as they compete across tech and trade arenas. Gathering Communist Party elites will review China’s upcoming five-year plan, an economic blueprint whose direction is strictly dictated by top leadership in the authoritarian state. Meanwhile, the  US government shutdown  stretches toward its third week as democratically elected lawmakers remain locked in a standoff over spending in the year ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The plenum will be closely monitored by outsiders for clues about the inner workings of China’s opaque ruling Communist Party. Intrigue heightened on Friday, when state media announced the  ousting of China’s No. 2 general , the highest-ranking casualty yet of Xi’s ongoing anti-corruption purge of the armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The conclave comes at a critical time for Beijing. China’s leadership sees itself as navigating an increasingly hostile global landscape – with US trade frictions and mounting restrictions on Chinese access to Western technology – while also grappling with deep-seated economic challenges at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economic growth slowed to its lowest point this year in the third quarter, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, which reported 4.8% growth year-on-year – down from 5.2% the previous quarter – as those pressures weigh on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 full and non-voting delegates of the powerful Central Committee will gather in Beijing for the closed-door plenum, one of seven meetings typically held within five years, between party congresses.\n \n\n   \n  The five-year plan in focus this week is expected to emphasize China’s economic security and technological innovation in sectors like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new energy and biotechnology. It will run from 2026 through the end of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  But that won’t be the only item on the agenda, and the conclave may also include a personnel reshuffle if new officials are appointed to key roles vacated by those purged.\n \n\n   \n    The next five-year plan\n \n\n   \n  Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not emerge until after it is approved by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March next year. But Xi has already given strong hints about his priorities as he looks to adjust China’s economic strategy to ensure “high-quality development” for the rest of the decade.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade that Xi could well see out in power. The strongman leader broke precedent to remain head of the party and the state for a third term starting in 2022, and has so far avoided elevating an heir apparent.\n \n\n   \n  Xi earlier this year called on provincial leaders to spend the next five years focusing on the development of emerging and future industries and breakthroughs in core and cutting-edge technologies, while also coordinating “development and security” and considering “internal and external risks.”\n \n\n   \n  China has already made sweeping advances in high-tech industries, like electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, and is fast catching up with the US in other advanced areas like semiconductors, AI and biotech – sectors included in the current five-year plan, which ends this year.\n \n\n   \n  But the country’s industrial innovation has also been marred by production overcapacity. A surge of production has fueled frictions with trade partners that accuse China of flooding global markets, while also contributing to persistent deflation and price wars between competing firms at home.\n \n\n   \n  China’s economy also needs rebalancing as it faces a prolonged property slump, persistent deflation, weak consumer demand and high youth employment, as well as longer-term concerns like its rapidly aging and shrinking population.\n \n\n   \n  China’s slowing growth in the third quarter relative to the rest of the year increases pressure on the Communist Party to accomplish its annual growth target of around 5%. Overall, the economy has grown 5.2% year-on-year in the first three quarters.\n \n\n   \n  Officials on Monday attributed the third quarter decline to a “complex and severe external environment,” including the impact of tariffs on the global economy, as well as China’s economic transition between “new and old” drivers of growth.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the economic headwinds, many observers expect Xi will largely look to stay the course he’s already charted for China, while making some targeted adjustments.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few reasons to expect that a new five-year plan would deviate, considering that Xi Jinping has been in control of the whole system now very definitively … and doesn’t need to have a big headline (initiative)” at this stage, said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  Gunter said to expect “some signaling” in the coming plan around boosting consumption and addressing “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. But signs of a deeper shift, if it comes, would include meaningful efforts in the coming months and years to expand the social safety net and tackle issues around subsidies and over-investment, among others, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential personnel moves\n \n\n   \n  All eyes will also be on any personnel changes that could take place this week, including potential appointments to the powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees China’s 2 million-strong armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  The CMC has been rocked by Xi’s anti-corruption purge, with three of the body’s six uniformed members ousted since 2023, including He Weidong, the No. 2 general.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement of his removal Friday confirmed months of speculation about He’s fate after he  vanished from public view last March . He, who served as a CMC vice chairman, was also a member of the 24-member Politburo, the second-highest echelon of Communist Party leadership.\n \n\n   \n  His ousting from the party was announced alongside that of fellow CMC member Miao Hua, who was removed from his military position in June, as well as seven other officers. All “were suspected of severe duty-related crimes involving exceptionally large amounts of money,” according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  The shake-up leaves an unusual number of spots open on the party’s Central Committee, which began its term in 2022 with 205 members and 171 non-voting alternates. About a dozen seats are expected to be filled by alternate members at this plenum.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear whether Xi will choose to refill the ranks of the CMC, which he chairs – or whether he will prefer to keep his close hold on the smaller group.\n \n\n   \n  The existing vacancies on the Central Committee and the potential for other disciplinary moves this week could bring “the biggest personnel shake-up” at a plenum since at least 2017, according to Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “Record purges strengthen, not weaken, Xi’s grip over the party and the (People’s Liberation Army). Every Central Committee member knows their future hinges on staying in Xi’s good graces,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/entertainment/sam-rivers-death-limp-bizkit","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"Limp Bizkit Band Members Say Bass Player Sam Rivers Has Died","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sam Rivers, the bassist of Limp Bizkit, has died, according to band members who shared the news on social media.

 \n  An artillery shell fired as part of the  Marine Corps’ 250-year anniversary celebrations  prematurely detonated over Interstate 5 in California Saturday, striking a patrol vehicle with shrapnel, according to the California Highway Patrol.\n \n\n   \n  No injuries were reported from the incident, which took place in an area where the highway patrol had stopped traffic during the live fire exercise at Camp   Pendleton, the agency   said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps was alerted and canceled the firing of additional live ordnance over the highway.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an unusual and concerning situation,” California Highway Patrol   Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said in the statement. “It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway. As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.”\n \n\n   \n  The live demonstration had sparked a back-and-forth between Vice President JD Vance, who spoke at the event, and California Gov.

No injuries occurred and the demonstration concluded as scheduled.”\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps is investigating the incident, Dreibelbis said. Marines on the West Coast “are committed to our enduring and mutually beneficial relationship with the people of Southern California,” he said. “Their safety and confidence is invaluable.”\n \n\n   \n  Highway Patrol said it filed an internal report with a recommendation to review the coordination between federal, state and local government around the event.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp Pendleton demonstration, which the Marines called the largest in a decade in the continental US, involved fighter jets, helicopters, Navy vessels and live fire from a towed howitzer.\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Newsom  closed a section of Interstate 5  in Southern California ahead of Saturday’s demonstration, citing “extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers.”\n \n\n   \n  “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous,” Newsom, a Democrat who has  frequently sparred with the Trump  administration, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President   Vance’s office disputed Newsom’s claim that the live rounds were dangerous, saying that the demonstration was “an established safe practice.”\n \n\n   \n  “If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,” William Martin, Vance’s communications director, said in a statement to CNN. “It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.”\n \n\n   \n  In his   remarks from Camp Pendleton, Vance — the first Marine to serve as vice president — spoke of his time in the military, saying, “I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/national-nuclear-security-administration-furloughs-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00.000Z","title":"Federal agency overseeing US nuclear stockpile will furlough most of its workforce starting Monday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the federal agency overseeing the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough about 1,400 employees starting Monday, October 19, 2025, as a result of the ongoing government shutdown.

workforce starting Monday \n       \n  By René Marsh, Ella Nilsen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:51 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal agency responsible for overseeing and modernizing the US nuclear stockpile will furlough the vast majority of its staff Monday as the  government shutdown  drags on, according to the Department of Energy.\n \n\n   \n  About 1,400 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, will receive furlough notices Monday, while fewer than 400 employees will remain on the job to safeguard the stockpile, Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Energy Secretary Chris Wright will speak about the shutdown’s impact on the US’ nuclear deterrent efforts Monday while visiting the Nevada National Security Site.\n \n\n   \n  The NNSA Office of Secure Transportation, which oversees the transportation of nuclear weapons around the country, will be funded through October 27.\n \n\n   \n  “Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses,” Dietderich said in a statement. “We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”\n \n\n   \n  The furloughs will first impact NNSA sites that assemble nuclear weapons, such as Pantex in Texas and Y-12 in Tennessee, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Because those facilities require large teams to manufacture weapons, furloughs will force those sites into safe shutdown mode.\n \n\n   \n  “Contractors will continue doing very minimal work until they themselves run out of money,” another NNSA source said. “But the day-to-day rhythm of federal oversight, the approvals and monitoring of these contractors, keeping everything on track, will grind to a halt because the people responsible for oversight will be furloughed.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s furloughs mark the first wave of disruption for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever minimal work contractors are able to continue to do as far as building weapons, enriching special nuclear material, stockpile surveillance, that will stop when the contractors run out of money,” the second source warned. “The earliest we could see that happen is around October 28.”\n \n\n   \n  At that point, the agency would no longer be able to deliver weapons to the Department of Defense. “Everything would be locked up,” the second source said.\n \n\n   \n  Shutting down mid-operation comes with its own complications.\n \n\n   \n  “To stop in the middle of disassembling or building a nuclear weapon, there are several steps you must take to ensure everything is safe enough to leave and lock up,” the second source explained. “And then when you come back, you have to do all of that in reverse to restart. It takes time, it’s not like flipping a light switch.”\n \n\n   \n  For now, both NNSA sources say, there is no immediate national security threat.\n \n\n   \n  “The nuclear stockpile today is reliable and can accomplish what it’s designed to do,” the second source said. “But if we can’t continue our modernization, refurbishing, doing surveillance, then it’s the reliability of the stockpile that’s affected, and it’s going to take some time to play catch up on all of that work.”\n \n\n   \n  Security staff guarding facilities with weapons and nuclear materials will remain on the job. However, ceasing operations at Pantex and Y-12 will stall modernization efforts for the US nuclear stockpile, the sources told CNN. The Department of Defense has been pushing the NNSA to produce new and modernized weapons on time, and a government shutdown could delay that schedule significantly — depending on how long it lasts.\n \n\n   \n  “While the Energy Department and NNSA remain committed to ensuring the safety and security of America’s nuclear deterrent, the longer the shutdown lasts, the more damaging and dire the consequences will be for workforce retention and weapons modernization efforts critical to national security,” Dietderich said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the agency, frustration is high.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a lot of frustration and disappointment that Congress can’t get this done,” one source said. “Especially considering what’s at stake.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/sport/football-nfl-week-7-sunday-review-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"05:59:00-04:00","title":"Historic and dramatic comebacks, second-year QB breaks Tom Brady record and high-profile benchings: NFL Week 7 Sunday review","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season was marked by dramatic comebacks, record-breaking performances, and significant coaching decisions.

Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:59 AM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The theme of the  NFL  season so far has been the uncertainty of results, with late comebacks or collapses happening more and more.\n \n\n   \n  And Week 7 was no different, with teams overturning seemingly insurmountable leads to somehow rescue results from the most unlikely of situations.\n \n\n   \n  Through the first seven weeks of the campaign, there have been 26 games with a lead change in the final two minutes of regulation this season, the most in NFL history over that span.\n \n\n   \n  There were also records broken and several starting quarterbacks benched for struggling squads.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know from Sunday’s action in  Week 7  of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Down, but not out\n \n\n   \n  Like other weeks, Sunday was punctuated with comebacks from the most unlikely of positions.\n \n\n   \n  The most dramatic of those came in Denver where the Broncos overturned a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter to stun the New York Giants 33-32.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos offense had been largely lifeless through the first three quarters at Empower Field, even leading to some boos from the home crowd. The Giants, meanwhile, had rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart moving the ball and putting points on the board, throwing two touchdown passes and running back Tyrone Tracy rushing in another.\n \n\n   \n  That’s when everything went out the window.\n \n\n   \n  Second-year passer Bo Nix exploded from his slumber, throwing 16-of-25 for 174 yards and two touchdowns while also running for two scores in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Having scored four TDs in the final quarter, the Broncos still trailed by two points following a one-yard Dart touchdown run with just 37 seconds remaining.\n \n\n   \n  But Nix connected with Marvin Mims and Courtland Sutton on deep passes to set up a Wil Lutz field goal as time expired to hand Denver a remarkable victory.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , teams were 161-0 since 2007 when shutting out their opponent and leading by 18 points or more after first three quarters before Sunday. The Broncos are now the first team to overcome that deficit in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Nix reflected on the dramatic comeback.\n \n\n   \n  “I was thinking about how I was going to answer questions if we got shut out. It’s not where you want to be,” he told reporters. “At some point, I knew we’ve done it before in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We know at some point we are going to go ahead and score. It may be too late and we may not score enough, but at some point, we are going to do it. We did. We had a good drive there at the end of the third and scored quickly in the fourth. It’s almost like once we scored and got the two-point conversion we knew how to play all of a sudden. I don’t have many answers but we just kept fighting.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t the only late comeback on Sunday though.\n \n\n   \n  The Green Bay Packers also scored two touchdowns in the final quarter, including one with just under two minutes left, and forced a late turnover on downs deep in their own territory to beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-23.\n \n\n   \n  The Cardinals, led by backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, needed a touchdown on their final drive of the game to secure an unlikely victory.\n \n\n   \n  But, as had been the case throughout the game, Brissett was disrupted by a swarming Packers defense led by Micah Parsons, who was a terror all game.\n \n\n   \n  Parsons, who was traded to Green Bay from the Dallas Cowboys in a blockbuster trade ahead of the season, had his third sack of the game on Arizona’s last drive and was disruptive throughout as the Packers improved to 4-1-1 on the season and first in the NFC North division.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots QB breaks Tom Brady record\n \n\n   \n  Following Tom Brady’s departure from New England and the end of his Super Bowl-laden spell with the Patriots, the franchise has been searching for its next cornerstone quarterback.\n \n\n   \n  And if this season’s displays are anything to go by, they might’ve just found him in the form of Drake Maye.\n \n\n   \n  Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, had arguably his best performance yet in a Patriots jersey on Sunday, going almost perfect in the team’s 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old threw 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries. He was poised in the pocket and made vital throws at key moments, while he was helped out by a solid running game.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps even more impressively, Maye fell to the ground and took a hard hit to the head in the second quarter, leaving the game and returning a few moments later to throw a touchdown pass to Austin Hooper.\n \n\n   \n  In his excellent performance, Maye hit two historic milestones.\n \n\n   \n  He became first player in the Super Bowl era to complete 90% of his passes, throw for over 200 yards and rush for over 50 yards in a single game.\n \n\n   \n  More notably for the Patriots, his 91.3 completion percentage broke Brady’s  franchise record of 88.5% , which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  Maye said after the game that it comes as a result of the whole team improving together.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ve just grown as an organization. I think with (head) coach (Mike) Vrabel and his staff I think we’re just buying into each other and build an identity,” Maye told reporters. “And I think that’s what’s kind of the biggest thing for me is trying to be the same player every week.”\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s performance continues Maye’s breakout season with the Patriots and gave head coach Mike Vrabel a victory in his first game against the franchise who fired him in January 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Some Titans fans could be heard chanting Vrabel’s name as the game went on, with some even holding up signs apologizing to him for how his time in Tennessee ended.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t get that many tickets, I don’t know …,” Vrabel said of the chants. “I’m happy for our players. I think these guys they’re figuring out how to win, they’re figuring out how to practice. I guess it’s humbling to have these people whoever that is cheer for us whether that’s the Patriots or Drake Maye or me or anybody else.”\n \n\n   \n    Benchings\n \n\n   \n  While some teams are on the up, for others, the season might already be over.\n \n\n   \n  Take the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets for instance. The two AFC East rivals are a combined 1-13 after each suffered a humbling loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  For Miami, it was a disaster from start to finish, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throwing three interceptions for the second straight week, including one which was returned for a touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  Tagovailoa’s performance was so catastrophic that he was benched in the fourth quarter for seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers.\n \n\n   \n  There were very few positives to take from the 31-6 defeat to the Browns for head coach Mike McDaniel – the team suffered errors on defense, turnovers on offense and key penalties throughout – with pressure ramping up on his position.\n \n\n   \n  The vibes are arguably worse with the Jets who remained the only winless team at 0-7 in the NFL after their 13-6 home loss to the Panthers.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, the Jets defense showed up, but the offense failed to pick up its end of the bargain. It got so bad that New York quarterback Justin Fields was benched at halftime after struggling in the first half.\n \n\n   \n  Over the first two quarters against Carolina, Fields went 6-of-12 on his pass attempts for 46 yards and added 22 rushing yards on four carries, leading an offense which totaled 97 yards during his time on the field.\n \n\n   \n  Fields was replaced by Tyrod Taylor who was able to move the ball more effectively but threw two costly interceptions.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the quarterback change after the game, head coach Aaron Glenn said his team “needed a spark.”\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that it was the right time to do it,” Glenn explained. “It’s a tough situation for both of those guys, but it was my call. It was my call and I felt it was the right time to do it.”\n \n\n   \n  The loss was even more damning for first-year head coach Glenn given the fact that Carolina lost starting QB Bryce Young to an ankle injury midway through the second half and was still able to hold out for a first win on the road this season.\n \n\n   \n  Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets in the offseason but Glenn was noncommittal about who the team’s starting quarterback going forward will be.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ll make the call,” Glenn said, “but there’s a lot of conversation I got to have with myself to see what can I do to make sure that we give us a chance to win.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll make the right decision.

October 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         For nearly three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, the public face of the Biden administration through daily briefings and trips around the world. In a new book,  Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines , published Oct. 21, Jean-Pierre says that the party's internal dysfunction and disloyalty had helped pave the way for its 2024 defeat. Speaking with  Morning Edition  host Michel Martin, she reflected on her time in the administration and described why she decided to step away from the party she once represented. Here are five takeaways from the conversation. 1. She says the debate revealed political vulnerability — not cognitive decline Jean-Pierre opened her book with her account of the June 2024 presidential debate, the night questions about former President Joe Biden's health and acuity intensified. \"I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep,\" she said. \"So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick.\" She said she immediately recognized how the optics might play publicly. \"Everything that I've been pushing back on — his age, is he fit — like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go.\" Still, she maintained she had seen no reason to doubt the president's ability to serve. \"I stand by that. I stand by that 110%.\" 2. She blames, in part, Democratic disunity for Trump's return Jean-Pierre argued that Democrats' inability to rally around Biden cost them politically. \"Joe Biden, objectively, had a very successful four years,\" she said. \"And here we are on the cusp of an election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it … and we weren't able to do it.\" She cited figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney who, she said, signaled their doubts about the president. \"All of it,\" she said, \"contributed to a perception of disunity.\" 3. She says criticism of her as press secretary reflected deeper bias Jean-Pierre recalled the scrutiny she faced at the podium, including claims she was \"too wooden\" or lacked policy depth. \"Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet,\" she said. \"What I can do is state facts, which is that no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium.\" She said she understood that \"as a Black woman, things are just different for people who look like me.\" 4. She says Democrats had failed Black women — even as they relied on them In a chapter titled \"Sisterhood,\" Jean-Pierre described the loyalty of Black women voters within the party. \"I feel like, if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake ... we get forgotten,\" she said. She said she had appreciated the Biden-Harris administration's effort to elevate those voices: \"They felt seen when they saw me at the podium, behind that lectern, whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant — they felt seen, and that mattered to me.\" 5. She says becoming an independent was about accountability, not defection Jean-Pierre said her decision to identify as an independent was meant to start a conversation about the direction of American politics. \"Look, for me, I'm not telling people, Hey, you go become an independent,\" she said. \"There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that?\" She also said Democrats had failed to anticipate what would follow their loss. Jean-Pierre said she hoped the book would encourage engagement rather than cynicism. \"There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet, because silence is complicit.\" The radio version of this interview was produced by Barry Gordemer and edited by Adriana Gallardo. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   For almost three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, meaning she was the face and voice of the Biden-Harris administration during daily White House briefings and trips around the world. In a new book, Jean-Pierre argues that Democrats knew what was coming ahead of their defeat in the 2024 elections and not only didn't do enough to stop it, but also helped it along by being disloyal, shambolic and insufficiently committed to its stated values. This led her to ask herself if this was still the party for her. Her answer? No. Jean-Pierre says she no longer identifies as a Democrat. The title of her new book and her new political stance is \"Independent.\" And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for joining us. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you so much for having me, Michel. MARTIN: You open the book with your experience behind the scenes of the June 2024 presidential debate, a date that's, you know, seared into a lot of people's memories. And it was there that questions around then President Biden's kind of health and mental acuity really seemed to take off. So tell us a little bit about what you saw behind the scenes. JEAN-PIERRE: So I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep, and it was on the political side. I was not involved in the campaign in any way. So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh-oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick. So I thought to myself, something is up. And so what I started thinking from that moment was, oh, goodness. This is what is going to be used for everything that I've been pushing back on, his age - is he fit? Like, automatically, anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go. MARTIN: Let me just be clear here. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: Because you are very clear in the book that you saw no reason to question the former president's mental acuity, his fitness for the job. You stand by that. JEAN-PIERRE: I stand by that 110%. MARTIN: I do want to say that you realize that a lot of people just don't believe that. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, all I can tell you is what I saw with my own eyes and what I experienced myself. MARTIN: To that end, your beef is not with journalists asking questions. JEAN-PIERRE: No, my beef is not with journalists, no. MARTIN: The core of the book is about the Democratic Party and what you experienced at the White House. You write about what you call bickering and backbiting. So say more about why... JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: ...You say that that backbiting is what opened the door for you to think about other alternatives. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So Joe Biden objectively had a very successful four years. And here we are on the cusp of a election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it. They were able to get behind their guy, however flawed their guy is. And they say, yep, this is our guy. With all the flaws and everything, this is our guy. And we weren't able to do it. MARTIN: By that you mean, like, for example, the former speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, sort of letting it be known that she was concerned. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes. MARTIN: Or George Clooney and his piece in The New York Times. JEAN-PIERRE: All of it, all of it. MARTIN: Is that what you're talking about? JEAN-PIERRE: All of it. And I talk about that in the book. MARTIN: One other thing you write about, which I really found was interesting, is, like, the snippety sniping directed at you. Apparently, there are people who felt you weren't very good at your job. They said you were too wooden at briefings, that you didn't really understand policy. How do you understand those critiques now that you have some distance from it, or do you? JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet. I didn't defend myself in the moment because I was focused on a job that I was honored and privileged to have had, which is the White House press secretary, because the president believed that I can do this. What I can do is state facts, which is no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium standing behind that lectern. And when we are first, you are critiqued and looked at differently because people already don't think you belong there in that position. And, you know, look, I had a job that was coveted. MARTIN: Interesting. JEAN-PIERRE: And the people who wanted my job didn't think I deserved the job for whatever reasons, right? And so I understood as a Black woman that things are just different for people who look like me. MARTIN: You write at length about how you feel the Democratic Party has particularly failed Black women. JEAN-PIERRE: So I have a chapter on, it's called Sisterhood. It's kind of a love letter to Black women. And I feel like if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake, 92% for Kamala Harris. Black women understand, look, there's a crisis here. Not only is it going to affect me and my family and the community that I love, but it's going to affect everyone. And we feel like it is our duty to try to save and try to really speak out. And we get forgotten. And one of the things that I respected from the Biden-Harris administration is we didn't forget them. And you see that in how we made sure Black women's voices were everywhere within the administration. I do believe, and I want to be very clear about this, that I meant a lot to people because of the communities that I represented. They felt seen when they saw me at the podium behind that lectern. Whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant, they felt seen. And that mattered to me. And I wrote this book because I truly believe in what I'm saying, and I want to start a conversation. I'm not looking for a fight with Democrats or Republicans. I'm looking to - well, I'm looking to have a conversation. MARTIN: OK. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: So let's have that conversation. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: What does identifying as an independent solve the problem that you have identified? JEAN-PIERRE: Right. Look, for me, I'm not telling people, hey, you go become an independent. That's not my role. There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that? There is a fundamental problem here. For me, it is I want to show, how is this person going to fight for my vote? Rubber-stamping Trump's appointees, let me tell you, that is not the way that that should've gone. We knew what was about to happen, Project 2025. Anti-DEI was, like, one of the first things. We knew. Immigrants being attacked, we knew this was going to happen. And so I feel like we should've been better. MARTIN: So you said you wanted to start a conversation. The book is just out. What are you hearing from people? JEAN-PIERRE: I hope people are inspired to continue to either be in the fight or get into the fight. There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet because silence is complicit. MARTIN: Karine Jean-Pierre is the author of \"Independent: A Look Inside A Broken White House, Outside The Party Lines.\" Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for talking with us. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, Michel. I appreciate it. Thank you for the opportunity.\\ \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/europe/robbery-louvre-paris-france-museum-closure-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Thieves Steal 'Priceless' Jewelry from the Louvre in 7-Minute Raid","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a meticulously planned seven-minute heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, thieves stole eight of nine high-value artifacts from the French Crown Jewels, including a tiara, necklace, and brooches from queens Marie-Amélie and Eugénie, using an angle grinder to break a window in the Apollo Gallery.

 \nUpdated: \n        6:19 PM EDT, Sun October 19, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thieves stole “priceless” jewelry from the Louvre in Paris in an audacious seven-minute raid that took place just after the world’s  most-visited museum  opened on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  In what appeared to be a professional heist, the robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, and made off with artefacts from the French Crown Jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  Two high-security display cases were targeted, and eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for, including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, the French culture ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves forced open a window using an angle grinder and stole jewelry that has “sentimental value and is priceless,” French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said.\n \n\n   \n  Four perpetrators appear to have been involved in the theft, who were unarmed, but threatened the guards with the angle grinders, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.\n \n\n   \n  Beccuau said that investigators have not ruled out foreign interference as a possible line of inquiry into the theft; but were keeping all leads open.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves dropped or left behind one item – the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III.\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond their market value, the items have inestimable heritage and historical value,” the interior ministry said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron said that “everything is being done” to catch the suspects.\n \n\n   \n  “The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage we cherish because it is part of our history,” Macron said on X, “ We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  A detailed list of the stolen items released by the culture ministry revealed a single earring from the sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, an emerald necklace and pair of emerald earrings from the parure of Empress Marie-Louise, the “reliquary brooch,” and the tiara and large corsage bow brooch of Empress Eugénie were stolen in the heist.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to set fire to the truck used to carry out the raid was foiled by a Louvre security officer, according to the culture ministry’s statement.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation for “aggravated theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy to commit a felony,” has been opened by Paris police under the authority of Paris public prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Get out, evacuate’\n \n\n   \n  The robbery took only seven minutes, with the suspects fleeing on motorcycles, Nuñez told France Inter radio. “Clearly, a team had been scouting

A yellow vest used by the perpetrators to disguise themselves as workmen was found a bit further away, lost during their escape, the newspaper said.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed French police examining an abandoned furniture elevator positioned next to a corner of the Louvre, with its ladder leading up to a broken window off a balcony.\n \n\n   \n  A tour guide told CNN how he had heard what sounded like “stomping” on the window as he led tourists through the Apollo Room, before hearing shouts from security guards to evacuate.\n \n\n   \n  “I was just trying to figure out what’s happening when I saw the museum staff going to that noise. Then they did a turn around, like real quick, and they started running and saying ‘get out, get out, get out, get out, evacuate!’” Ryan el Mandari said.\n \n\n   \n  He tried to keep his group of visitors calm as they left the building, he said, adding that they heard the sounds but “had no clue that it was a robbery.”\n \n\n   \n    Robbery planned ‘meticulously’\n \n\n   \n  The French interior ministry said the incident took place at 9:30 a.m. local time and that members of the public had been evacuated without incident.\n \n\n   \n  Minister of Culture Rachida Dati said the robbery had taken place as the museum opened. “No injuries were reported. I am on site alongside museum staff and the police. Investigations are ongoing,” Dati said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The museum, which houses world-famous artworks including Leonardo da Vinci’s  Mona Lisa,  said it would remain closed on Sunday due to “exceptional reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  The interior ministry later said the closure was a security measure to preserve evidence for the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  The mayor of Paris Center, Ariel Weil, told reporters that the thieves had “planned this meticulously, obviously” and that he could not recall the Louvre being the target of a robbery in more than a century. “I’m thinking, of course, of the  Mona Lisa sting  in 1911, but I can’t think of any more recent robbery,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577961","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:48:00-04:00","title":"Just Because She Won a Nobel Doesn't Mean Malala Didn't Break Some Rules in College","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores Malala Yousafzai’s personal journey after her Nobel Peace Prize win, focusing on her experiences at Oxford University, where she struggled with identity, trauma, and mental health.

rules in college \n         By Tonya Mosley \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 11:48 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Fresh Air \n        \n      \n\n         When the  Taliban  closed schools and banned women from public life in Pakistan's Swat Valley, a schoolgirl named  Malala Yousafzai  spoke out. But activism nearly cost Yousafzai her life; in 2012, when she was 15, she was shot in the head while riding home on a school bus.  Yousafzai survived the assassination attempt, but her life changed completely. Suddenly she was a symbol of resistance to the Taliban — praised, politicized and picked apart. When she was 17, she became the youngest person ever awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , an honor that weighed on her as she went off to Oxford University a few years later.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I always have felt that now I need to live up to the expectation [of the Nobel],\" Yousafzai says. \"It was given for the work I had done, but it was also given for the work that is ahead of us. ... I have to work for the rest of my life to prove that it was well deserved.\" Prior to college, Yousafzai had never been away from her parents or lived on her own. At Oxford, she struggled to know who she was as a person. \"This was the first time I allowed myself to be more of myself, to really just test it. ... Am I funny? Am I not? What do I enjoy?\" she recalls.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Yousafzai chronicled her childhood in the 2013 memoir,  I Am Malala .  In the new memoir,  Finding My Way , she writes about her life at Oxford and beyond. It's the story of a college student who, like many others before her, tries marijuana, fails exams and falls in love for the first time. But it also reveals Yousafzai's efforts to deal with the trauma of the attack she had survived years earlier. \"When you face violence, harm and trauma yourself, you understand how terrible and horrible it is,\" she says. \"Whether it's girls being banned from school in Afghanistan, or girls' schools being bombed in Gaza, or children being forced into labor, or girls being married off. … I just hope that we can create a world without any war and terror and harm for children.\" Yousafzai's foundation, Malala Fund, continues to advocate for girls' education worldwide. Interview highlights On illicitly climbing onto a rooftop in college That moment just felt surreal. I was so scared that I might be kicked out of college for this. ... I was terrified that being an advocate for education and then getting in trouble and getting kicked out. … For me it was wanting to disobey rules. I thought I had to live up to expectations and be a certain way. I could never get in trouble. I thought if this is something that puts me in the \"cool kids\" category or the \"rebellious kids\" category, I wanted to give it a try. I wanted these college years to be that experience that I otherwise would never come across. On having a bad reaction to smoking marijuana, which triggered PTSD  The bong incident just turned out to be an experience not that I had imagined. I had heard cool things about it and of course it's different for everybody. In my case, there was this unaddressed trauma. The memory, the visuals, everything had been there. My brain had tried to suppress them because it's a moment of fear that you do not want to see again .  When the bong incident happened, my body froze and I was reliving the Taliban attack. I could see the gunman. I thought this is happening all over again. I often say that I received my surgeries and I recovered so quickly from the Taliban attack, but when this happened I realized maybe I actually had not fully recovered. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On struggling with anxiety and depression, seven years after the attack  I just felt so disappointed with myself that somebody who faced a Taliban gunman was somehow now scared of these small things. It was all trivial stuff that made no sense to me. I thought that I had lost my courage, that I was not brave enough. … I felt like an imposter. And then one of my friends suggested that I see a therapist. On why she was initially against marriage  Growing up I had seen many girls lose the opportunity to complete their education and their dreams to become a doctor or engineer because they were married off. Marriage, that was the last thing I wanted to think about. I did not want to get married. It was not a cool thing. If you wanted to have a future as a girl you wanted to keep yourself away from marriage for as long as you could. … It just meant more compromises for women that you had to readjust to the husband's family and you had to pray that the husband turns out to be  a nice, respectful person. On reading feminist authors before deciding to get married  When I saw Asser I immediately fell in love with him. I knew that I wanted to be with him. So I felt like I was sort of holding his hand … while I was looking on the other side trying to figure out what is marriage and all these things about and am I ready or not? I knew that we had to be married because in our culture for two people to be together you have to be married. But then marriage just felt like a very heavy topic for me. I even went to read some books. … I was like, please Virginia Woolf, help me, bell hooks, can you share a few words of wisdom? I was looking for an answer, like, just someone tell me yes or no. What I realized in the process was it is about understanding the history of these things. It's about the culture, the context, but more importantly then, it's about the two people who decide to be together. What is their mutual understanding? And I realize that Asser was the right person.

EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         AMMAN, Jordan — Israel, having banned the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees from sending aid and staff to Gaza, is now taking unprecedented steps to de-register major nongovernmental aid groups for ideological reasons, according to several officials of   humanitarian organizations. They say the new rules threaten the ability of some of the biggest international nongovernmental organizations — known as INGOs — to send in aid or staff to both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"INGOs are in limbo — most who have submitted have either been not accepted or rejected,\" an official with an aid organization that is aware of the situation said of the application process required for nongovernmental aid organizations operating in Gaza and the West Bank. The official spoke on the condition that NPR not name their employer and not give their name because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war brokered this month by President Trump committed Israel to a surge in aid into Gaza, where food security experts  declared famine  in parts of the territory. But Israel continues to severely restrict crossings open for aid shipments and who can send aid through them. Of seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza, only two are currently open. Of those that are open, the U.N. and nongovernmental aid groups say many requests to enter Gaza are routinely rejected, without explanation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Israeli military has claimed, without providing evidence, that its aid restrictions are needed for security. Israel this fall began requiring that all international aid groups re-register  under new criteria , including approval by a committee which includes representatives from Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. Reasons for delisting aid groups include supporting \"terrorist groups and activities in accordance with Israel law\" and \"inciting racism,\" according to COGAT, the Israeli military's arm that is part of NGO approval process. Aid organizations say the reasoning appears to be used to refer to a wide variety of comments the Israeli government classifies as antisemitic. Israel has in the past accused some aid groups and medical providers of being terrorist organizations. Israel had also demanded that organizations provide personnel details for all local and international staff, a measure rejected by most major aid groups as potentially putting staff in danger. The Norwegian Refugee Council, registered in Gaza since 2009, is one of the major aid groups unable to send in supplies or staff while its application is being considered. \"We quickly realized that the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the re-registration of humanitarian INGOs but rather to find a way to re-register us and to remove our ability to operate,\" says Ivan Karakashian, communications manager for the NRC in Jerusalem. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He says there were no clear guidelines as to what delegitimizing Israel included. Any de-registered organizations would have to cease operations in both Gaza and the Israeli occupied West Bank within 60 days, according to aid officials familiar with the criteria. The Israeli military arm responsible for borders and coordination with INGO operations did not respond to NPR's requests for comment on reasons for de-registering or delaying registration of some organizations. Many of those aid groups waiting to be re-registered have had hundreds of trucks waiting for months in Egypt and Jordan intended for Gaza. Humanitarian officials said at least one major U.S.-based NGO has already been de-registered and is now in the appeal process. The organization in question declined to discuss the issue with NPR. Another U.S.-based aid group, Mercy Corps, said following the ceasefire agreement, it had submitted a request to send in aid but it was denied by Israeli authorities because the organization was in the process of re-registering. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Humanitarian officials said Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that do not coordinate within traditional U.N.-led structures and are either ideologically driven or have little experience in humanitarian aid or both. They include one U.S. aid group that partnered with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a militarized aid response in which almost all other aid groups refused to participate. COGAT did not respond to a request for comment on new aid organizations given registration. At the same time, Israel continues to ban the U.N. agency for providing aid to Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, from sending in aid or staff to Gaza. Israel accused UNRWA, without evidence, of employing hundreds of Hamas members, including some involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. It has sought since the start of the Gaza war to replace the U.N. aid system that has provided humanitarian assistance there for decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       UNRWA, with 12,000 local staff, was the biggest humanitarian organization in Gaza, running shelters, mobile medical clinics, water and sanitation projects and schools. \"The warehouses in Jordan and Egypt are full of food that can feed the entire population of Gaza for three months and we need to bring that in,\" says Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA's director of external relations. The supplies also include medicine, tents, blankets and hygiene products. Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed  more than 90% of homes  in Gaza and most of the civilian infrastructure, according to U.N. figures. The United States, which had been UNRWA's biggest donor, stopped its funding last year, which Alrifai says led to a loss of about one-quarter of UNRWA's total income. Alrifai says while European and other countries have increased their contributions, it does not fill the funding gap. The European Union's top humanitarian aid official said after the Israeli accusations against UNRWA  he saw no evidence from Israel  backing them. Alrifai says UNRWA was trying to start discussions with the U.S. through other countries about renewing the funding. \"We have not had direct talks but we have passed on messages through other governments who are close to Gaza and close to the U.S.\" she says. Aya Batrawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Israeli strikes in Gaza continue despite its military pulling back troops under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that took effect last week. Today, an attack killed a Palestinian family of 11, including seven children and three women. Israel also committed under the ceasefire to dramatically increase the amount of aid it allows in. Aid groups say that isn't happening. NPR's Jane Arraf joins us now. Jane, thanks for being with us. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: What's happened in this attack, and what's happening with the ceasefire? ARRAF: Well, Gaza Civil Defense authorities say this was one of the many families returning to inspect the ruins of their home in Gaza City when Israeli forces fired a tank round at their minibus. The Israeli military said that the family was behind the yellow line where its troops are positioned and that they fired on it because they were an imminent threat. That yellow line, Scott, is visible on the map, we have to note, but not so much to families on the ground. And the ceasefire itself, it's still holding overall, but Israel still controls more than 50% of Gaza territory. It says it plans to mark that yellow line with a physical barrier. SIMON: Israel also pledged to allow 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza. Has that happened? ARRAF: It hasn't. The U.N. says that 600 is the bare minimum to keep people from starving, to provide shelter and repair infrastructure in what is a totally devastated territory. Israel is still keeping shut one of those main border crossings, Rafah, which is Egypt's border crossing with Gaza. And that's where many hundreds of trucks have been waiting for months to be allowed in. It has been allowing aid through two other crossings. But there, it's a bit of a numbers game because Israel refers to all trucks as aid trucks. So just to give you an example, two days ago, the figures show 950 trucks entered Gaza. But a Trump administration official shed some light on that. It appears that only about 10% of that figure were U.N. or international aid organizations, and most of the rest were commercial imports. Those are imports from Israel, by the way. SIMON: And the United Nations has urged Israel to allow the aid organization with which it partners to continue to send aid into Gaza. Help us understand that. ARRAF: Yeah. That's a huge issue which hasn't received a lot of attention. The U.N. doesn't need to be registered, but international nongovernmental organizations, INGOs, do. And Israel this year said it would shut down aid groups that didn't reregister under the new criteria, so it's begun that process. This criteria has a committee that determines whether the organizations have delegitimized Israel through statements or anything else. Here's Ivan Karakashian, the communications manager at the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem. IVAN KARAKASHIAN: We quickly realized that this wasn't - the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the reregistration of INGOs, of humanitarian INGOs, but rather to find a way to deregister us - right? - and to remove our ability to operate within the occupied Palestinian territory. ARRAF: He says his organization is in the process of trying to reregister, and that also applies to some of the biggest U.S. aid groups. If they don't, if they can't, that means they're shut down. SIMON: Jane, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, was the biggest provider of aid in Gaza for decades before Israel banned staff and shipments there. Is that expected to change? ARRAF: Israel hasn't given any indication it's lifting that ban. It had claimed - without evidence - that hundreds of UNRWA staff are Hamas. And the U.S. also cut funding to UNRWA. Some of that funding, but not all of it, was made up by other countries. I spoke with UNRWA's head of external relations, Tamara Alrifai, and here's what she had to say. TAMARA ALRIFAI: We still are trying to work our way back into discussions with the U.S. You know how they say it takes a village? It takes an international community to want the situation in Gaza, in the occupied Palestinian territory and in the region to be stable.

    \n           Updated Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:25 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he believes public pressure will mount on Republicans in the coming days to extend health insurance subsidies that are the heart of the shutdown fight. Most of the federal government remains shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats again failed to pass a spending bill Monday that would reopen the government. Democrats, who have put forward their own spending resolution, remain steadfast that Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies used by more than 20 million people to afford monthly health premiums should be extended. With the credits expiring at the end of the year and ACA open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, many buying insurance through their state's marketplace  are likely to see their monthly costs soar . In an interview with  Morning Edition , Jeffries said he believes \"it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\" Some Republicans have proposed a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which Jeffries has opposed. In  a separate interview with  Morning Edition , GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Democrats knew the subsidies would expire and dared Jeffries to sign onto the one-year extension if he was \"serious\" about it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, Jeffries said that \"If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance … it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working class Americans,\" referring to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Jeffries discussed how the shutdown is playing out and why Democrats remain adamant on their position. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Interview highlights Michel Martin:  Last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries:  Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak, indicating that their health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles are about to skyrocket double, triple — or in some cases, quadruple — at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues taken together need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. Martin:  So as you just pointed out, Nov. 1 is a crucial date because that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage, without the subsidies, those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from, will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? Jeffries:  Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. The pressure is going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time, as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly in states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. We now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. Editor's note: About 90% of ACA premium tax credit recipients have annual incomes at or below $63,000,  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin:  So yesterday you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something that President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid. And you feel that that's not right. There still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. What do you say to them? Jeffries:  I support the military being paid. We, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House, have introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Sen. Ron Johnson [R-Wisc.] apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from day one of this presidency and allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hard working federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal, it's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety. And we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   We've been speaking with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle since the government shutdown began 21 days ago. Today, we are joined by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He represents a district in New York. Good morning, Leader. Thanks so much for joining us. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be on. MARTIN: So last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Would you, as briefly as you can, remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats? JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on November 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak indicating that their health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles are about to skyrocket, double, triple or, in some cases, quadruple at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues, taken together, need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. MARTIN: So as you just pointed out, November 1 is a crucial date 'cause that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage without the subsidies. Those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? JEFFRIES: Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. And so the pressure's going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly. In states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, we now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so, clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, Michel, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. MARTIN: Why is that? JEFFRIES: Well, because the - there's one system. And to the extent that you begin to remove people from health insurance in numbers that would be contemplated - more than 20 million, perhaps - that's the number of Americans who... MARTIN: Well, the argument being - the argument here being that people... JEFFRIES: Yes. MARTIN: ...Will drop out because it's unaffordable, right? Is that the argument here? JEFFRIES: That's - well, people will drop out because it's unaffordable. And as a result, the costs are going to increase on everybody else. MARTIN: So last week, I spoke with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler. He's a member of the New York delegation, one of your colleagues. He confronted you earlier this month in the Capitol, and this is what he had to say. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) MIKE LAWLER: If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill. And so I've already signed on to legislation to extend the subsidies by a year, and that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign on to this bill with me? MARTIN: What do you say to that? What's wrong with extending the subsidies for a year to give you more time to negotiate? JEFFRIES: Well, what we've made clear is that we need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits at a level that will provide certainty to the American people, who are already struggling with the high cost of living in this country, living paycheck to paycheck, can't thrive, can barely survive. Now, Mike Lawler and his Republican colleagues earlier this year did all that they could to pass the one big, ugly bill, which included the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Fourteen million people are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage throughout the country, including in rural America. Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health clinics are about to close across the country, and we're already seeing that happen in some states. And all of this was done so that Republicans could provide massive tax breaks that they made permanent for their billionaire donors. If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that, you know, will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance because, in part, it was paid for by a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working-class Americans. MARTIN: So yesterday, you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid and you feel that that's not right, there still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. How - what do you say to them? JEFFRIES: Well, it's a very important question. In terms - I support the military being paid. And we, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House had introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Ron Johnson apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers, who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from Day 1 of this presidency. And allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hardworking federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways, is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal. It's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety, and we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. MARTIN: That is Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York. He's the House minority leader. Leader Jeffries, I do hope you'll come back and talk more about this as this situation continues. Thank you so much for joining us today. JEFFRIES: Thank you.

female prime minister \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:59 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Japan's  first-ever female prime minister , Sanae Takaichi, is an ultraconservative with a traditional view of gender roles and a penchant for heavy metal music. Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was  chosen to lead  the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month. Takaichi, 64, is \"one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP,\" explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute. But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once  belted a rock anthem  on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity  for motorcycles  and  cars . \"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that [she is] more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun,\" Hall says. Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader. 1. She isn't from a political family Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department. \"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means,\" Hall says. \"But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan.\" But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house. In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of  Rep. Pat Schroeder , a Democrat from Colorado — despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter. \"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan,\" Hall says. \"If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections.\" 2. She's spent decades in politics  Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent. She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security. Notably, she served as the minister of international communications — which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations — under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency,\" Hall says. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his  assassination in 2022 . He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy — nicknamed \"Abenomics\" — and rebuild its role on the global stage. Takaichi \"definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy,\" Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election. \"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have,\" he said. 3. Her views have caused controversy Takaichi subscribes to modern monetary theory, \"which says that you can engage in deficit spending on important things like defense and other parts of the budget,\" Hall says. While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the  war crimes trials  that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders. Takaichi is also known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where the convicted war criminals are buried and glorified. But she noticeably  abstained from visiting  during last week's autumn festival, sending a ritual offering instead. Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a  rapidly growing industry  in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists  kicking sacred deer in Nara Park , part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic. \"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country,\" Hall says. She has advocated for an  anti-espionage law , suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she  called for restrictions  on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration. \"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it,\" Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of  significant labor shortages . 4. She's not necessarily a feminist  Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held  about 10% of seats  in parliament as of 2024. Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality — the lowest of any Group of Seven nation — according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report . However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced,\" Hall says. \"But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show … young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too.\" Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically  advocating for the expansion  of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own  struggles with menopause  symptoms. Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids — and grandmother to four — from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member  Taku Yamamoto , who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.) Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to \" Nordic levels ,\" or  closer to 50% . But in the hours after taking office, she  appointed only two . Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party. While she and her role model Margaret Thatcher differ in their approaches to fiscal policy, he says both are conservative, hawkish and \"do not want to be seen as weak.\" \"She maybe, in a way, has modeled her rise on Margaret Thatcher by being this very strong figure, despite coming [up] in a party of very conservative men who generally do not promote women to the highest positions,\" he adds. 5. She appears friendly toward Trump Takaichi has indicated a friendliness toward President Trump, who called her \"a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength\" in a  social media post  earlier this month congratulating her on her rise to party leadership and her expected ascension to prime minister. She responded with a post of her own, writing in both English and Japanese that she is \"truly hoping to work together with President Trump to make our alliance even stronger & more prosperous, and to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hall says Trump likely has a good first impression of Takaichi already, because of her reputation as an \"anti-immigration, hard-line conservative who is a respecter of his late friend Shinzo Abe.\" Abe was one of the first foreign leaders to cultivate a relationship with Trump during his first term. The  two became friends  as they bonded over wagyu beef burgers, sumo wrestling and golf. Trump is expected to meet Takaichi on a visit to Japan later this month. Hall predicts she will follow the same playbook as her predecessors: \"You be as nice as possible to the president, you show him the maximum respect, you do not have public disagreements with him,\" he says. \"And when you do disagree over policy, you do it in a very subtle way that doesn't seem like you're telling the president he's wrong.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5563790","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:03:00-20:00","title":"New books this week dance between genres — and deserve your attention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This week’s new book releases challenge traditional genre boundaries, with works that blend memoir, fiction, history, and fantasy.

Colin Dwyer \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 1:03 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Don't even think about reading these new books — at least, not unless they shape up real quick and start respecting the venerable genre distinctions of our forebears. The last thing we want to do is encourage the kind of troublingly seductive world they represent, in which memoir can just be mixed willy-nilly with fiction, and history, and fantasy and philosophy and … well, you get the idea. We teeter on the cusp of utter madness. Won't somebody  please  think of the genres! OK, I'll admit: I'm being a bit facetious here. All six of the following notable releases do deserve your attention for one reason or another — many, precisely  for  their spry dance with the expectations established by the genres they invoke. But I do ask that, when you pull one of them down and crack it open, you at least spare a thought for the poor, polite label that has been left behind, flaunted and dejected, on the bookshelf where it had stood. Looking for Tank Man , by Ha Jin Jin Xuefei had been in the U.S. for what was to be a temporary stay, pursuing graduate studies after his time in the Chinese army, when tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in 1989. He never returned to China; he began writing in English as Ha Jin,  condemned Chinese censorship  and claimed several of America's highest regarded  literary prizes . But the violent suppression of student protests at Tiananmen —  his \"turning point,\"  he told NPR in 2014 — continues to haunt him in his effective exile. In his latest novel, a fictional Chinese graduate student, studying in the U.S. years later, turns her research toward comprehending and coming to terms with the massacre — and reckoning with the urgency of keeping its memory alive. Bad Bad Girl , by Gish Jen  Don't call Jen's new book a memoir, exactly. This gimlet-eyed account of a difficult mother-daughter relationship makes up too much stuff to qualify; but then, to call the book a novel feels misleading too. The book  is  a candid portrait of her relationship with her mother, Agnes, even if it steers more toward emotional truth than factual accuracy. We can leave these questions for the philosophers, or whoever decides the genre tags on Amazon. (Same difference?) The point is, Jen has applied her peculiar set of skills — a candid but big-hearted style once described by  Fresh Air's  Maureen Corrigan as  \"Frank Capra-esque\"  — to one of the central dramas of her own life. Big Kiss, Bye-Bye , by Claire Louise-Bennett Louise-Bennett's books don't tend to lend themselves to snappy back-cover summaries. Conflict and other traditional fiction-fuels  are  found in them, sure; it's just that those external stimuli often end up feeling secondary to the expansive inner life of her unnamed narrator. In her latest novel, as in  Pond  and  Checkout 19  before it, a snapshot of the action — in this case, a woman reflecting on her memories of a fading relationship and wondering at the nature of love — doesn't exactly scream \"page-turner.\" But when the pages are actually turning, the effect,  as a reviewer explained for NPR , can be \"unusual, and so unsettlingly pleasurable.\" Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy , by Julia Ioffe Now here's another book with no respect for the sanctity of bookshelf labels. The veteran journalist's first book is a mongrel mixed from memoir, history and reportage, in which Ioffe's own memories mingle with archival dives and on-the-ground conversations. What emerges is a portrait of Russia's past and present, viewed from the fluctuating social and legal positions of its women. For what it's worth, the trajectory of their social standing under today's oligarchy doesn't appear particularly positive.  Motherland  is one of just five books that  still stand a chance of winning  this year's National Book Award for nonfiction. This Is the Only Kingdom , by Jaquira Díaz The hardscrabble early years of Díaz's life in Puerto Rico and Miami, veined as they were with poverty, casual peril and a precarious mother-daughter relationship, boasted enough drama to fill a book in their own right — and indeed they did: her first book,  the 2019 memoir  Ordinary Girls . In her second book, Díaz plies her skills in fiction, with a debut novel that spans generations and centers some rather shaky mother-daughter bonds of its own, amid the tumult of the Puerto Rican barrio. The Rose Field: The Book of Dust, Volume 3,  by Philip Pullman It was in the mid-1990s Pullman published  The Golden Compass , his first novel in what became the His Dark Materials trilogy. An all but immediate international sensation, the original trilogy spawned dozens of translations and a veritable host of screen and radio adaptations — and now, just about three decades later, a completed  follow-up trilogy in print .  The Rose Field  answers the cliff-hangers of  its direct predecessor,  The Secret Commonwealth , and puts a bow on this heady, hefty return to Pullman's beguiling world of daemons, witches and armored ursines. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94264","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-04:00","title":"A theory why the internet is going down the toilet","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the theory of 'enshittification,' a concept introduced by internet activist and author Cory Doctorow, which describes how internet platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Uber degrade from user-friendly, innovative services into exploitative and harmful systems over time.

A theory why the internet is going down the toilet \n         By Greg Rosalsky \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 6:30 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This first appeared in the Planet Money newsletter.  Sign up here! A few years ago, Cory Doctorow coined a word that took the internet by storm. It appeared everywhere, including in our newsletter that analyzed  why dating apps are breaking the hearts of their users . The American Dialect Society named it its word of the year in 2023. Merriam-Webster even added it to its dictionary — despite it having a swear word in it. The word Doctorow coined is \"enshittification.\" And, naturally, that's also the title of  his new book . Enshittification is more than just a catchy word, describing when companies turn to crap. For Doctorow, a long-time internet activist and journalist, it describes a specific process he sees in the evolution — or, really, the devolution — of internet platforms, like Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon. (Disclosure: Google and Amazon are financial supporters of NPR and Amazon pays to distribute some of our programming.) The Stages Of Enshittification In his new book, Doctorow argues there's a pattern in how these platforms operate. The companies behind these platforms are basically middlemen, connecting their users with businesses that want to make money from these users. So, for example, Facebook and Google connect their users with advertisers. Amazon connects its users with third-party merchants on its marketplace. Stage 1 is when these platforms are new and want to entice users onto their platforms. They are flush with investor cash, face less pressure from shareholders to make immediate profits, and are in a race to convince people to sign up. This is when the platforms are really good to their users. For example, in its early days, Facebook told users that they wouldn't spy on them and harvest their data the way they said MySpace did. And they offered \"a feed of things that users wanted to see, rather than things that businesses would pay to show them,\" Doctorow writes. For a while at least, Facebook was \"fun and useful and valuable.\" Amazon and Uber offered consumers incredible deals during their stage 1. Like  others  before him, Doctorow alleges these deals were so good that they amounted to \"predatory pricing,\" or when companies charge below-cost, unsustainably low prices aimed at putting their competitors out of business. Stage 1 is all about achieving scale and locking in users. The platforms want to grow and benefit from what economists call \"network effects.\" That is, the more users they have, the more valuable their platform becomes. These platforms, Doctorow writes, also benefit from \"high switching costs,\" which mean that their users find it hard to leave and switch services. With Facebook, for example, leaving the platform and going to another social network means trying to convince your friends and family they should leave and go somewhere else too. With Prime, Amazon gets consumers to pay for free shipping up front, incentivizing them to keep using their platform. And, if you've ever bought e-books or movies on their platform, you can't take them with you when you leave. Stage 2: Being Good To Business Customers After these platforms achieve scale and lock in a large user base, they enter stage 2. That's when the companies start trying to entice business customers onto their platform by being really good to them — at the expense of their users. For Facebook, Doctorow writes, this meant changing the feeds that users saw. Facebook began using user data to target them with precise ads. Advertisers loved it. And they got publishers to publish short excerpts of their articles, and Facebook would \"nonconsensually cram those excerpts into the eyeballs of users who never asked to see them.\" This was a great deal for publishers, who became increasingly dependent on Facebook for traffic. Likewise, Amazon provided a great deal to its business customers. \"Amazon paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers,\" Doctorow writes. \"It subsidized returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers' queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.\" With users and businesses locked in to their platforms, that tees up Stage 3, when the companies start trying to recoup their investor cash and actually start trying to make a lot of money. Stage 3: When Everything Turns To Crap Stage 3 is when these platforms tighten their grips on business customers, squeezing money out of them. Facebook, Doctorow writes, began forcing advertisers to pay more for ad services and provided those advertisers with lower quality ad targeting. Wanting to keep internet traffic on their platform, they began forcing publishers to publish longer and longer excerpts of their articles in order to appear in user feeds. And they started charging them to \"boost\" their content in order for large numbers of users to see it, even when users had explicitly followed these publishers and signed up to see that content. \"Meanwhile, for users, things kept getting even worse,\" Doctorow writes. They were fed an algorithm not of stuff they had signed up to see, but rather one filled with \"content people paid to put there: ads and boosted content.\" We reached out to Facebook (Meta), and they didn't respond for comment. Amazon, Doctorow writes, began using its data on merchants' sales to \"clone\" their products. He asserts Amazon began gaming their search algorithm to benefit themselves. And Doctorow asserts Amazon began charging merchants junk fees. \"Add all the junk fees together, and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of  45 to 51 cents on every dollar  it earns on the platform,\" Doctorow claims. \"Even if a merchant  wanted  to absorb the 'Amazon tax' on your behalf, it couldn't. Merchants just don't make 51 percent margins.\" So the merchants have to increase their prices. (We reached out to Doctorow about where he got these numbers, and he cites  this 2023 study  from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit research and advocacy organization). Stage 3, he writes, is also worse for consumers in other ways, like search quality. \"On average, the first result in an Amazon search is  29 percent  more expensive than the best result for your search,\" Doctorow claims. \"Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen, and you'll pay an average of 25 percent more than you would for your best match. On average, the best match is located  seventeen  places down in an Amazon search result.\" (Doctorow cites  this study  and  this study ). From the perspective of these platforms and their shareholders, you might call Stage 3 enrichification. But, for users and business customers, Doctorow writes, this is \"the end-stage of enshittification, the stage at which a platform turns into a pile of shit.\" Naturally, we reached out to Amazon about Doctorow's arguments and claims. \"The book's entire theory about Amazon is incorrect,\" an Amazon spokesperson says. \"Even a cursory look would show that the value Amazon offers customers has only gotten better and better over time.\" In regards to Doctorow's assertion that Amazon \"clones\" products of smaller businesses, the spokesperson responded, \"We follow the same practices as countless other retailers to inform our private brands, and we prohibit employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private-label products to launch.\" About search, they said they do not favor their own products in results. And they say it's \"categorically false\" that Amazon introduced \"junk fees.\" The spokesperson says Docotrow's figures are \"false and misleading because they conflate required selling fees with the cost of optional services — such as logistics, customer service, and advertising — that some sellers choose to purchase from Amazon or other providers. Amazon selling fees are 15% or less in most product categories.\" And, the spokesperson stressed, the extra fees are optional. \"Sellers who choose to purchase optional services from Amazon do so because Amazon provides more value than they can get elsewhere.\" Why Doctorow believes platforms degrade over time Most of Doctorow's explanation for why internet platforms have gone down the toilet is hardly novel. While he offers some interesting technical nuances and solutions, his analysis largely comes down to two big factors: a lack of competition and an absence of the right, pro-consumer regulations. Doctorow argues that these internet platforms have been treating their users and business customers like crap because they  can  treat them like crap. They can act this way because they don't fear their users will flee to competitors or that they'll be sanctioned much by the government. Put another way, the castles of these companies' profit engines are protected by moats. Each moat is made of things like network effects and switching costs. Their customers either don't want to leave en masse or have a hard time escaping. And, at least until recently, the government has proven unwilling or unable to try and storm the castles. To increase competition, Doctorow advocates for more vigorous antitrust enforcement and abandoning an influential legal doctrine known as \"the consumer welfare standard.\" This standard was adopted by the courts in the late 20th century. It judges whether companies are monopolies or anti-competitive not based on how big or powerful they are, but on whether they are measurably harming consumers, typically through demonstrably higher prices (We tell the origin story of this standard, and explore the new movement to change it in  this  Planet Money  series  about antitrust. Give it a listen). When it comes to improving regulation, Doctorow offers a number of interesting ideas. One is, essentially, making it easier for users to leave platforms. For example, passing regulations that would allow Amazon Kindle users to take their e-books with them. He argues that this \"right-to-exit\" would be easy to administer. And it would create real incentives for platforms to be better to their users. Doctorow also spends a lot of time singing the praises of \"interoperability.\" It's a technical computer term that basically means allowing products or services to work with other products or services. One example is printer ink cartridges. In his ideal world, any competitor would be able to make ink cartridges that are compatible — or interoperable — with a given printer. However, in the existing system, makers of printers are able to make it so users must use only their special, very expensive ink cartridges in their printers. This exclusivity is obviously a money-making scheme. The tech companies have made it so many of their products and services are not interoperable with each other. iPhones won't run Android apps. Bluesky users can't DM their old Twitter contacts. Doctorow suggests these are artificial barriers created by companies to maintain their market power, and that regulations have helped them do it. And, yeah, lefty consumer advocates like Doctorow seem to be mostly losing in today's America. But he points out that the anti-tech monopoly movement has really gathered steam in recent years, including overseas. And he believes there are clear policy solutions that are popular, including with many conservatives, that can \"reverse the enshittification of the internet.\" Reminder for those of you following along with Planet Money's Board Game project :  We're going to have a live online chat you can join on 11/1 about the game, the process, and how it's going.

Humans, take note! \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 7:13 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Ants are many things. They're hard workers and intensely social. They're quite strong for their size. And now they may also be a source of architectural inspiration too — for designing spaces that reduce the spread of disease. This discovery comes from a new study focused on  Metarhizium brunneum , a common and lethal fungus for insects, including the black garden ant. For this fungus to propagate, it kills its host, taking over the host ant's dead body and transforming it into something called a sporulating cadaver. \"It's basically completely covered in spores and is highly infectious,\" says  Nathalie Stroeymeyt , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Bristol. In research in the journal  Science , she and her colleagues report that black garden ants manipulate the structure of their nests to respond to this fungal pathogen and slow down its transmission. Social distancing, ant-style In 2018, Stroeymeyt and her colleagues published a study that considered how small colonies of black garden ants  respond socially  to the introduction of the lethal fungus. The scientists glued tiny squares of paper with QR-like codes to the thoraxes of the ants and used an automated video tracking system to follow the movements of individuals over time. The infected workers quickly self-isolated. \"They spend more time out of the colony to prevent contamination of their nestmates,\" she says. In addition, some of the healthy ants — the nurses that take care of the queen, eggs and larvae — increased their distance from the foragers, \"which are the ones who go outside and are more at risk of contracting a disease,\" says Stroeymeyt. \"So it was a form of proactive social distancing, if you wish.\" This work revealed that the ants altered their social behavior to protect themselves from infection and safeguard high-value members of the colony. Stroeymeyt wondered if the ants were making bigger changes — by altering the spaces they shared — the \"hundreds of chambers connected by thousands of tunnels,\" as she puts it. So Stroeymeyt teamed up with Luke Leckie, now a systems biologist at Indiana University Bloomington, to investigate whether the ants could shift how they excavated and built their nests when threatened by a pathogen. Leckie says ants are industrious and dynamic builders. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       So that made him wonder: \"Maybe they can manipulate the structure of their nest to avoid these transmission hotspots where there can be loads of interactions and protect the colony from the spread of epidemics.\" Architectural immunity To determine the impact of infection on nest architecture, Leckie and his colleagues gave small colonies of black garden ants a day to start building their nests. Then, in half of the nests, they introduced individual ants infected with the fungus. Over the course of six days, he took noninvasive CT scans of the nests. \"They let us see the three-dimensional structure of the nests as it's developing over time,\" Leckie says. There were clear differences between the nests that were exposed to the pathogen and those that were not. According to computer simulations, these differences appeared to help lower disease transmission, reducing the risk of the fungal pathogen breaching the entire nest. First, the nests were more compartmentalized and less interconnected. Nest entrances were also spaced farther apart, reducing interactions between ants that were entering and exiting. Travel routes were longer, which made the nests less efficient but helped insulate healthy ants from infected ones. These structural changes had the overall effect of improving the ability of infected ants to isolate themselves, which Stroeymeyt had documented previously. The social and architectural changes \"work together to really provide a very effective protection,\" she says. \"It's a first demonstration of a social species outside of humans who actively modifies the spatial structure of the environment in face of a threat. That I find absolutely fascinating.\" Sarah Kocher , an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University who wasn't involved in the study, says the findings deepen our understanding of something called social immunity found among many types of ants and bees. \"Instead of relying on their individual immune systems,\" she says, \"they work together as a group to try to minimize disease spread and utilize ways that their collective behaviors can help to defend them against these diseases.\" In addition, Kocher believes these ants have something to teach us.   \"Some of the principles could easily be applied to the way that we are designing public spaces that could help us prevent disease spread as well,\" she says. For instance, the ants seem to be protecting more vulnerable members of their community by isolating sections of their enclosure. Stroeymeyt agrees that we can seek inspiration from these ants, developing human ways of using architecture to reduce the risk of infection. \"We can learn from social insects, which have evolved over millions of years,\" she says, \"to find strategies that balance this protection against epidemic without completely disrupting the functioning of the entire colony.\" But she believes these connections will emerge down the road since the results in this paper are \"too ant-like to have direct application today.\" So perhaps one day, humans will benefit from this notion of architectural immunity, inspired not by antibodies — but by ant bodies. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Ants are many things. Like, they're very strong for their size, and they're intensely social. And, as Ari Daniel reports, they might be sources of architectural inspiration, too, for designing spaces that reduce the spread of disease. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: The ant in question is Lasius niger, the black garden ant. NATHALIE STROEYMEYT: It lives everywhere in Europe, and you can just collect queens during the mating flight in July, which makes it very easy to work with. DANIEL: This is Nathalie Stroeymeyt, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Bristol who studies how these ants deal with a deadly fungus. STROEYMEYT: In order to successfully transfer, it needs to kill its host. DANIEL: Transforming that host ant into something called a sporulating cadaver. STROEYMEYT: It's basically completely covered in spores, and it's highly infectious. DANIEL: Which puts any ants nearby in grave danger. Stroeymeyt has studied how these ants respond socially to the lethal fungus by gluing tiny squares of paper with QR-like codes to their thoraxes to track the individual ants' movements over time. First, she saw that infected workers quickly self-isolate. STROEYMEYT: They spend more time out of the colony to prevent contamination of their nest mates. DANIEL: In addition, some of the healthy ants, the nurses that care for the queen, eggs and larvae, increase their distance from the foragers. STROEYMEYT: Which are the ones who go outside and are more at risk of contracting a disease - this was a form of proactive social distancing, if you wish. DANIEL: Combined, this work revealed the ants alter their social behavior to protect themselves from an epidemic and safeguard high-value members of the colony. STROEYMEYT: And that happens even when the nest is as simple as it can be with a single chamber. But in reality, they occupy these nests made of hundreds of chambers connected by thousands of tunnels. DANIEL: Stroeymeyt wondered whether the ants also shift how they build and excavate their nests when threatened by a pathogen. She teamed up with Luke Leckie, now a systems biologist at Indiana University, to investigate. He gave small colonies a day to start building their nests before introducing ants infected with the fungus. LUKE LECKIE: We were taking CT scans of the nests. They let us see the three-dimensional structure of the nest as it's developing over time. DANIEL: Within six days, there were clear differences between the nests exposed to the pathogen compared to those that were not - differences that, according to computer simulations, appeared to help slow down disease transmission. LECKIE: They were kind of more compartmentalized, and they were less interconnected. DANIEL: Nest entrances were also spaced farther apart. Travel routes were longer, making the nests less efficient. But these structural changes enhanced the previously documented social response of the ants to isolate. Here's Nathalie Stroeymeyt again. STROEYMEYT: It's the first demonstration of social species outside of humans who actively modifies the spatial structure of the environment in face of a threat. That, I find, is absolutely fascinating. DANIEL: The results are published in the journal Science. Sarah Kocher is an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University who wasn't involved in the study. She says the findings deepen our understanding of something called social immunity found among many types of ants and bees. SARAH KOCHER: Instead of relying on their individual immune systems, they work together as a group to try to minimize disease spread. DANIEL: In addition, Kocher believes these ants have something to teach us. KOCHER: Some of the principles could easily be applied to the way that we're designing public spaces that could help us prevent disease spread as well. DANIEL: Principles like protecting more vulnerable members of the community and isolating sections of an enclosure. Think of it as architectural immunity delivered not by antibodies, but by ant bodies. For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

       The White House starts demolishing part of the East Wing to build Trump's ballroom \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Updated Monday, October 20, 2025 • 9:12 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday started tearing down part of the East Wing, the traditional base of operations for the first lady, to build President Trump's $250 million ballroom despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing. Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening \"right behind us.\" \"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,\" he said, adding, \"It just started today.\" The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property. \"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,\" Scharf said last month. It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown. The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself. \"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" he said of the White House. The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Nothing will be torn down,\" Leavitt said when she announced the project in July. Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn. Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed \"with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.\" The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself. At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement. The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so. Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom. Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available. \"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" the company said in an emailed statement. The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581173","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"American chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies at 29","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Daniel Naroditsky, a celebrated American chess grandmaster born in San Mateo County, California, to Jewish immigrant parents from Ukraine and Azerbaijan, died at age 29.

The chess world is very grateful,\" Hikaru Nakamura, an American grandmaster, said on a livestream Monday. In a final video posted to his YouTube channel on Friday titled \"You Thought I Was Gone!?\" Naroditsky tells viewers he's \"back, better than ever\" after taking a creative break from streaming. He talks viewers through his moves as he plays live chess matches on the computer from a cozy home studio. Other elite chess players from around the globe took to social media to express their shock and sadness. Dutch chess grandmaster Benjamin Bok reflected on his lifelong friendship with Naroditsky, who he said he's known since the Under 12 world championship that Naroditsky won in 2007. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I still can't believe it and don't want to believe it,\" Bok said on X. \"It was always a privilege to play, train, and commentate with Danya, but above all, to call him my friend.\" Naroditsky was the son of Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Ukraine and Azerbaijan. He was born and raised in San Mateo County, California, and was described by his parents as a very serious kid with an impressive attention span and memory. He went on to study history at Stanford University, earning a bachelor's degree in 2019 after taking a year off to play in chess tournaments. After college, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he coached the area's top junior chess players. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580732","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:30:00-04:00","title":"Dodgers and Blue Jays Set for World Series Clash After ALCS and NLCS Victories","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Toronto Blue Jays have defeated the Seattle Mariners in seven games to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1993, while the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the largest payroll and a dominant postseason run, including a historic performance by Shohei Ohtani, are set to face them.

Series. The Toronto Blue Jays are in their way \n         By Becky Sullivan \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 11:30 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Toronto Blue Jays, with a 4-3 win in Monday night's American League Championship Series Game 7 over the Seattle Mariners, are headed back to the World Series for the first time in more than 30 years. Their opponent: the $340 million buzzsaw known as the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       With the biggest payroll in baseball, the Dodgers are baseball's most successful franchise in recent years, with two World Series titles and five National League pennants over the past nine seasons. Now, they are four wins away from becoming the sport's first repeat champions in a quarter century. The Blue Jays emerged in July as one of the best teams in baseball and ended the season 94-68 on top of the AL East, a remarkable turnaround from 2024's last-place finish in the division. In the ALDS, Toronto's bats overwhelmed their division rival New York Yankees, pouring on 34 runs over four games. Still, Toronto needed all seven games of the ALCS to return to the World Series. The Mariners took the Blue Jays to the brink with 14 home runs and some dominant pitching performances that helped them jump out to a 2-0 series lead. But the Mariners, the only MLB franchise to have never reached the World Series, cracked as the pressure mounted late in the series. With a 3-2 series lead, needing just one win for their first-ever pennant, the Mariners committed three errors in a Game 6 loss, then, after taking a 3-1 lead in Game 7, allowed a late three-run home run by Toronto's George Springer to dash their hopes again. \"It was never a doubt that one of these guys was going to come through. It was just a matter of when,\" said Toronto pitcher Jeff Hoffman in a TV interview with Fox after the game. \"We kept it close enough for long enough, and they did.\" It is Toronto's first trip to the World Series since 1993, when the Blue Jays won back-to-back titles. By contrast, the 93-69 Dodgers stumbled at times during the regular season, including several late-game collapses by a shaky bullpen and a humbling September sweep by the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates. But in the postseason, Los Angeles has looked unstoppable. In the NLDS, the 96-66 Philadelphia Phillies managed only a single win over the Dodgers. And in the NLCS, Los Angeles swept the 97-65 Milwaukee Brewers. The Dodgers' crown jewel, the two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani,  single-handedly powered  Los Angeles to their Game 4 NLCS-clinching victory with three home runs as a batter and, as starting pitcher, 6.1 shutout innings with 10 strikeouts — a performance so herculean that it was instantly in the conversation for the greatest individual game of all-time. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In other words, the Dodgers are firing on every cylinder — and they will be an even bigger challenge for Toronto than Seattle. The Blue Jays excel at putting balls into play, which worked to their advantage in the ALCS. But Los Angeles is a better defensive team than the Mariners, and their starting pitchers are a level above, too. But Los Angeles does have a weakness: their bullpen, which lost plenty of games for the Dodgers in the second half of the season. The Blue Jays could have an opportunity there if they can put more pressure on the Dodgers' starters than the Brewers did (just two earned runs over four games). Game 1 of the World Series is set for Friday, Oct. 24, in Toronto. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5576978","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"'Cancer doesn't care': Patients pushed past divisive politics to lobby Congress","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite deep political polarization in the United States, over 500 cancer survivors, including individuals from diverse political backgrounds such as Mary Catherine Johnson (a Trump voter) and Lexy Mealing (a Democrat), united to lobby Congress during a citizen advocacy day in Washington, D.C. on September 16, 2025.

        By Noam Levey \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Mary Catherine Johnson is a retired small-business owner from outside Rochester, New York. She voted for Donald Trump three times. Lexy Mealing, who used to work in a physician's office, is from Long Island, New York. She's a Democrat. But the two women share a common bond. They both survived breast cancer. And when the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network organized its annual citizen lobby day in Washington, D.C., last month, Johnson and Mealing were among the more than 500 volunteers pushing Congress to keep cancer research and support for cancer patients at the top of the U.S. health care agenda. An annual plea The day in Washington is something of a ritual for groups like the cancer organization. This year it came as Democrats and Republicans in Washington slid toward a budget impasse that has shut down the federal government indefinitely. But these volunteers transcended their own political differences and found common ground. \"Not one person here discussed if you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican,\" says Mealing, one of 27 volunteers in the New York delegation. \"Cancer doesn't care.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Every one of the volunteer lobbyists had been touched in some way by the deadly disease, which is expected to kill  more than 600,000  people in the U.S. this year. Johnson said each of her mother's 10 siblings died from cancer, as did a lifelong friend who died at age 57, leaving behind his wife and two young daughters. Like many of the New York volunteers, Johnson also says she's worried about the state of politics today. \"I think we're probably the most divided that we've ever been,\" she says. \"That scares me. Scares me for my grandchildren.\" Katie Martin, a volunteer from outside Buffalo, N.Y., also worries. She and her daughter recently drove past political protesters screaming at one another on the street.  \"My daughter is silent and then starts asking, 'What is this?' And I don't know how to explain it, because it doesn't even make sense to me,\" she says. \"It's very heartbreaking.\" Mealing says she can barely watch the news these days. \"A lot of Americans are very stressed out. There's a lot of things going on.\" Bipartisan support Americans are indeed split over many issues: immigration, guns, President Trump. But helping people with cancer and other serious illnesses retains broad bipartisan support, polls show. In  one recent survey , 7 in 10 voters said it's very important for the federal government to fund medical research. That included majorities of Democrats and Republicans. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's rare in today's environment to see numbers like that,\" says Jarrett Lewis, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey for patient groups. \"But almost everybody in this country knows somebody who's had cancer.\" Similarly, a recent  KFF poll  found that three-quarters of U.S. adults, including most Republicans who align with the MAGA movement, want Congress to extend subsidies that help Americans buy health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. (KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.) These subsidies, which are critical to people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, are one of the main sticking points in the current budget impasse in Congress. As the volunteers gathered in a conference hotel in Washington, they focused on their shared agenda: increasing funding for cancer research, retaining insurance subsidies and expanding access to cancer screening. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We may not see eye to eye politically. We might not even see eye to eye in social circumstances,\" said Martin, the Buffalo-area volunteer. \"But we can see beyond those differences because we're here for one cause.\" The state delegations practiced the pitches they would make to their members of Congress. They ran through the personal stories they would share. And they swapped tips for how to deal with resistant staff and how to ask for a photo with a lawmaker. On the morning of their lobby day, Sept. 16, they reconvened in a cavernous ballroom, all decked out in matching blue polo shirts and armed with red information folders to leave at each office they would visit. They got a pep talk from a pair of college basketball coaches. Then they headed across town to Capitol Hill. The army of volunteers — from every state in the country — hit 484 of the 535 Senate and House offices. Not every visit was an unqualified victory. Many Republican lawmakers object to extending the insurance subsidies, arguing they're too costly. But lawmakers from both parties have backed increased research funding and support for more cancer screening. And the New Yorkers felt good about the day. \"It was amazing,\" Mealing said as the day wrapped up. \"You could just feel the sense of, 'Everybody stronger together.'\" Memorials and lessons When evening came, the volunteers met on the National Mall for a candlelight vigil. It was raining. Bagpipes played. Around a pond near the Lincoln Memorial, some 10,000 tea lights glimmered in little paper bags. Each luminary had a name on it — a life touched by cancer. John Manna, another New Yorker, is a self-described Reagan Republican whose father died from lung cancer. He reflected on lessons that this day could offer a divided nation. \"Talk to people,\" he said. \"Get to know each other as people, and then you can understand somebody's positions.  We have little disagreements, but, you know, we don't attack each other. We talk and discuss it.\" Manna said he would be back next year. KFF Health News  is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Republicans and Democrats can't agree on how to reopen the U.S. government. But hundreds of volunteers with the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society put political differences aside when they came to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress. Noam Levey with our partners KFF Health News has the story. NOAM LEVEY: The professional lobbyists in expensive shoes are filing into the Cannon House Office Building as a group of New York citizens circle up on the sidewalk outside. They're about to visit their congressman's office, and there's just enough time for a final rehearsal. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #1: On this paper, it says the messaging, we appreciate the congressman. This is a first step. We are urging Congress to act now. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #2: So do you feel comfortable with this? UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #1: Yeah. So I'll just read the... UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #3: Just read it. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #1: ...Whole thing. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #3: Just read it. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #1: OK. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #3: Yeah. LEVEY: The cancer volunteers are a microcosm of America - old and young, Black and white, Democrat and Republican. But they share a common bond - cancer. Mary Catherine Johnson is a retiree from outside Rochester in Upstate New York. MARY CATHERINE JOHNSON: My mom lost all of her 10 siblings to cancer. My lifelong friend succumbed to lung cancer at the age of 57. LEVEY: Johnson herself survived breast cancer. She's worried about the state of our politics. JOHNSON: I think we're probably the most divided that we've ever been, and that scares me. It scares me for my grandchildren. LEVEY: Katie Martin, a cancer volunteer from Buffalo, also worries. She and her daughter recently drove past political protesters screaming at one another on the street. KATIE MARTIN: My daughter is silent and then starts asking, like, what is this? And I don't know how to explain it 'cause it doesn't even make sense to me sometimes. LEVEY: Lexy Mealing, who lives on Long Island and, like Johnson, had breast cancer, says she can barely watch the news these days. LEXY MEALING: A lot of Americans are very stressed out. There's a lot of things going on. LEVEY: Mealing is a Democrat. Johnson voted for Donald Trump three times. Martin didn't want to discuss her politics. MARTIN: I wish that there was a safer question. LEVEY: But political affiliation wasn't important as the volunteers gathered in Washington. Here's Mealing again. MEALING: Not one person here discussed if you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican, because cancer doesn't care. LEVEY: The volunteers spent hours together practicing the pitches they'd make to members of Congress. On the morning of their Hill visits, they packed into a hotel ballroom. UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER #4: I think it's so important that we do this because not one of us has not been touched by cancer. LEVEY: The volunteers donned matching blue polo shirts and grabbed red folders to leave at each congressional office they'd visit. They got a pep talk from Lisa Lacasse, the head of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. LISA LACASSE: I know that you're going to make such an impact today. Thank you all so much, and I'll see you on the Hill. (APPLAUSE) LEVEY: Then it was on to the Metro for the ride up to the Capitol. AUTOMATED VOICE: This is Capitol South. Doors opening on the left. LEVEY: The army of volunteers hit 484 Senate and House offices, telling their stories and ticking through their priorities - funding for research, support for more cancer screening, federal aid for people to buy health insurance. The last was a tough sell in many Republican offices, but lawmakers from both parties have backed the other two. Mealing and the other New Yorkers were feeling good. MEALING: It was amazing. Seven hundred of us going up to the Hill today - you could just feel the sense of everybody just stronger together. LEVEY: When evening came, the volunteers met on the National Mall for a candlelight vigil. It was raining. Bagpipes were playing. (SOUNDBITE OF BAGPIPES PLAYING) LEVEY: Around a pond by the Lincoln Memorial, some 10,000 tea lights glimmered in little paper bags. Each luminary had a name on it, a person impacted by cancer.

about race and gender to be returned to school libraries on some military bases \n         By Elizabeth Blair \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense Monday to return books about gender and race back to five school libraries on military bases. In April, 12 students at schools on military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan claimed their First Amendment rights had been violated when nearly 600 books were removed from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools they attend. The students are the children of active duty service members ranging from pre-K to 11th grade. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia filed a motion on behalf of the families requesting the return of \"all books and curriculum already quarantined or removed based on potential violation of the Executive Orders.\" Earlier this year, President Trump issued executive orders  demanding  federal agencies remove and prohibit any materials that promote \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\" In January, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the memoranda \" Restoring America's Fighting Force ,\" which prohibited \"instruction on Critical Race Theory (CRT), DEI, or gender ideology,\" and \" Identity Months Dead at DoD ,\" which barred using official resources for celebrations such as Black History Month, Women's History Month and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. According to the plaintiffs, DoDEA officials sent emails directing teachers to remove books and cancel lesson plans and events that would be in violation of Trump's executive orders and Hegseth's guidance. Books removed from school libraries at military bases covered such topics as sexual identity, racism and LGBTQ pride. You can see a list of the books  here . Two elementary schools cancelled Black History Month events, teachers at a middle school were told to remove posters of education activist Malala Yousafzai and painter Frida Kahlo and another school cancelled Holocaust Remembrance Day. According to the motion filed by the ACLU, the students claimed that when they protested the school's actions, they were punished and became \"increasingly afraid to discuss race and gender in their classrooms, because they fear being silenced by teachers fearful of violating the EOs and DoDEA guidance.\" In her  decision , U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles sided with the students and their families, writing that \"the removals were not rooted in pedagogical concerns\" but rather there was \"improper partisan motivation underlying [defendants'] actions.\" Giles wrote that DOD officials must \"immediately restore the books and curricular materials that have been removed.\" The Department of Defense and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have not yet responded to NPR's request for comment. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5575108","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Tyshawn Sorey's powerful sounds of silence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tyshawn Sorey, a composer and multi-instrumentalist, explores the power of silence and space in his music, particularly in the piece Monochromatic Light (Afterlife), which draws deep inspiration from the Rothko Chapel in Houston and Morton Feldman's 1971 score commemorating its opening.

We had a hard time fitting this conversation into his schedule, but as soon as we sat down together in the vast open space of the abandoned railroad depot that had become NPR's makeshift recording studio, all the rush and noise seemed to disappear, and our conversation turned instead to the power of space and silence. One of the pieces Tyshawn presented at Big Ears was  Monochromatic Light (Afterlife),  inspired by the   Rothko Chapel in Houston and by Morton Feldman's 1971 score that commemorated the chapel's opening. That launch event was shrouded in darkness: one year earlier, Mark Rothko had killed himself after completing the suite of 14 large paintings that cover the chapel's walls. The darkness of this origin story is preserved in Rothko's color-field paintings, so dark they appear black at first. But really, those paintings are opportunities for the revelation of light. As you stay with them in the space, as rays of sun shift through the chapel's skylight, the canvases pull you into an awareness of nearly undetectable changes of light and shade. Time loses its normal contours. Space takes on new meaning. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       To achieve a distillation of that intensity in music means letting go of conventions and structures. For Tyshawn, that is common practice. As a drummer, trombonist and pianist, as well as a composer, he moves fluidly through both improvisational and notated music, centering the exploration of texture and time in a prolific body of work that ranges from solo piano to symphony orchestra. Like Rothko's chapel paintings, Tyshawn's musical canvas leaves room for the listener's experience, evolving slowly through the subtlest shifts of color and light. The night before my conversation with Tyshawn, I had dinner with bass-baritone Davóne Tines, one of the lead artists in  Monochromatic Light (Afterlife).  He met me in between his afternoon and evening performances of the nearly hour-long piece, an immersive invocation that requires unbreaking focus from the musicians as they navigate its wandering trajectory. But Davóne didn't seem exhausted, just hungry. \"I feel really chill,\" he told me. \"It's the silences, the spaces — those are places of reflection and rest.\" Reflection and rest, and perhaps release and relief. Just as the extreme darkness of Rothko's canvases lets light find its way, Tyshawn Sorey's silences allow for space and time, and blessed respite from the speed and noise of this fast-moving world. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580619","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Blue New Jersey is expecting a very close race for governor this November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New Jersey is embroiling in a closely contested gubernatorial race between Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, despite being a historically blue state.

        One of the country's few odd-year gubernatorial elections is capturing national attention, as the polls show an increasingly close race between the top two contenders to be New Jersey's next governor. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot first elected to Congress in 2018, is facing off against pro-Trump Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a longtime New Jersey politician and small business owner. In the closing weeks, both candidates have hurled increasingly personal attacks against one another and received endorsements from some of the biggest names in their parties. President Trump,  who endorsed Ciattarelli  earlier this year, is planning to host tele-rallies for the Republican contender,  Axios reported . Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama  released an endorsement video  for Sherrill last week, calling the Democratic Congresswoman the \"right choice\" to be New Jersey's next governor. Most mainstream polls  show Sherrill leading  Ciattarelli, but in some cases the margin is smaller than might be expected in the historically blue state.  One poll from September  showed the candidates tied. Political experts say although Democrats have a three-to-two  voter registration advantage  over Republicans in New Jersey, the Garden State has a history of electing governors from both major political parties. \"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections,\" says Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship at Rowan University. Phil Murphy, the state's current Democratic governor is leaving office after serving a limit of two terms. If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. The campaign has gotten increasingly personal Tensions have grown in the race to be Murphy's successor, with the two candidates and their campaigns trading personal attacks in recent weeks. Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly from 2011-2018 and is running for New Jersey governor for the third time, has repeatedly slammed Sherrill for being prohibited from walking at her Naval Academy graduation in 1994 in the midst of a cheating scandal at the school. Sherrill has said she was punished by the academy for refusing to turn in her classmates, and she's  criticized the Trump administration for improperly releasing  her largely unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign. Meanwhile, Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, has blasted Ciattarelli's former medical publishing company for producing materials downplaying the dangers of opioids. In a televised debate earlier this month, Sherrill said Ciattarelli was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey. Ciattarelli's campaign has  threatened to sue Sherrill  for defamation over those comments, with campaign strategist Chris Russell accusing Sherrill of \"baselessly and recklessly accusing a political opponent of mass murder.\" Also looming large over the campaign is Trump, who frequents his golf course in Bedminster, in Central New Jersey. Ciattarelli's embrace of Trump earned him the president's endorsement, despite the fact that in 2016 he  called Trump  \"a charlatan and an embarrassment.\" Sherrill has continued to tie Ciattarelli to the president and is urging New Jersey voters to reject Trump's MAGA movement at the polls. Affordability is top of mind for voters Though the personal attacks have stepped up, Dworkin doubts they will overpower voters' concerns about skyrocketing prices. \"The people who are going to make a difference, who are truly trying to decide where they will vote, want to talk about the cost of living and affordability,\" he says. Because both Sherrill and Ciattarelli have talked about  New Jersey's high cost of living , it may come down to who has the more convincing message. Nicole Nance, a Republican from Cherry Hill, said at a recent campaign event for Ciattarelli that she thinks his background as an accountant will be useful as he tries to lower the state's notoriously high property taxes. \"I think I'd rather have a [certified public accountant] with some type of experience help with the budget, you know, help run the state, than a pilot,\" she said, referring to Sherrill's military background. But Victor Carstarphen, the Democratic mayor of Camden in South Jersey, says he supports Sherrill's plans to build more housing and freeze rising energy costs. \"Listen, she's talked about these utilities, and how these utilities is going up higher and higher, and that affects a community like Camden,\" he says. \"She hits it spot on with that.\" In June, New Jerseyans'  electricity bills surged  17% to 20% depending on their provider, according to the state Board of Public Utilities. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   New Jersey voters will soon pick their next governor, and it could be a close race. At least one recent poll showed that the Democratic candidate tied with her Republican contender in what's traditionally a blue state. NPR's Joe Hernandez has this story from the campaign trail. JOE HERNANDEZ, BYLINE: The race is pitting Democratic congresswoman and former Navy pilot Mikie Sherrill against pro-Trump Republican and longtime New Jersey politician Jack Ciattarelli. JACK CIATTARELLI: Guys, how are ya? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Doing well. Yourself? CIATTARELLI: Jack Ciattarelli for governor. Just wanted to say hello. HERNANDEZ: At a recent campaign event at the Camden cheesesteak shop, Donkey's Place, Ciattarelli said the historically blue state is facing the problems it is thanks to its Democratic leaders. CIATTARELLI: The Democratic Party has controlled our state legislature for 25 years. They've controlled the executive branch for the past eight years, and we've had nothing but failures across the board. HERNANDEZ: Sherrill says it's the policies of President Trump that are hurting New Jersey and notes that Ciattarelli has Trump's endorsement. She questioned in a recent debate whether Ciattarelli would be able to stand up to Trump as governor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKIE SHERRILL: In fact, the president himself called Jack 100% MAGA, and he's shown every sign of being that. HERNANDEZ: National politics is playing into the campaign, but in recent weeks, the race has gotten increasingly personal. Ciattarelli has slammed Sherrill for being blocked from walking at her naval academy graduation during a cheating scandal. She says that happened because she refused to turn in her classmates. Meanwhile, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli's former medical publishing company of producing materials downplaying the dangers of opioids and said he was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey. Now, his campaign has threatened to sue her for defamation, saying Sherrill was, quote, \"baselessly and recklessly accusing a political opponent of mass murder.\" The pair traded attacks in a heated exchange during their last debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHERRILL: As you got more people addicted, as you worked to develop - got paid to develop an app so that more people could get more opioids and die. CIATTARELLI: I got to walk at... SHERRILL: But here's the facts. CIATTARELLI: ...My college graduation. SHERRILL: Even during - even... CIATTARELLI: I got to walk at my college graduation. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: As she served... HERNANDEZ: Though the personal attacks have stepped up, whether they'll move the needle among voters is another question. Ben Dworkin directs the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship at Rowan University. BEN DWORKIN: The people who are going to make a difference, who are truly trying to decide where they will vote, want to talk about the cost of living and affordability. HERNANDEZ: Both candidates have talked about the Garden State's high cost of living. So it may come down to who has the more convincing message. Camden's Democratic mayor, Victor Carstarphen, says he supports Sherrill's plans to build more housing and freeze rising energy costs. VICTOR CARSTARPHEN: Listen, she's talked about these utilities, you know, and how these utilities is going up higher and higher, and that affects a community like Camden. And she hits her spot on with that. HERNANDEZ: Nicole Nance sees it differently. The Republican from Cherry Hill says she thinks Ciattarelli's background as an accountant will be more useful as he tries to lower the state's notoriously high property taxes. NICOLE NANCE: I think I'd rather have a CPA with some type of experience, help with the budget, you know, help run the state than a pilot. That's just me. That's just me (laughter). HERNANDEZ: Most public polls show Sherrill leading Ciattarelli, though one shows a dead heat. Dworkin, the Rowan University professor, says New Jersey has a history of electing governors from both parties. DWORKIN: As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races, too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections. HERNANDEZ: New Jersey Democrats have a 3-2 voter registration advantage over Republicans, but they may not have history on their side. New Jersey voters haven't elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row since the 1960s. Joe Hernandez, NPR News.

Some software engineers are skeptical \n         By Huo Jingnan \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 9:17 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities. In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei  said  \"we'll be there in three to six months — where AI is writing 90% of the code.\" Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg  predicted  in April that for one project \"in the next year probably … maybe half the development is going to be done by AI.\" Executives of  Amazon ,  Google  and  Microsoft  have also highlighted large language models' (LLMs') abilities to generate code. AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers and there are now  fewer  of the most junior software engineers. But despite the dramatic rhetoric, AI in software engineering might not mean a new age of automation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After months of sitting on the sidelines, software engineer Colton Voege finally tried out AI tools for his work. He remembered watching a podcast where leaders of tech startup incubator Y Combinator, which helped Voege launch a  company , touted AI's \"incredible productivity.\" \"It kind of confirmed what I already felt about it, in that it's really good at shortcutting certain things,\" Voege said. \"[AI] is great for writing little tools that you'll use once and then throw away.\" But he hasn't seen evidence of long-term boosts to his efficiency. Interviews show that many software engineers, though not all, share Voege's experience. Some tell stories of untangling AI-generated code their colleagues have handed them, others talk about the pressure to make up work that purports to use AI to make higher-ups happy. Yes, AI can write code ... but still needs people In an interview with NPR, Boris Cherny, head of Anthropic's Claude Code unit, said \"most code is written by Claude Code,\" but declined to provide a percentage. \"We're still working on the science to make sure we can give a really precise number.\" Cherny was also clear that no matter how much AI is actually used, \"Every line of code should be reviewed by an engineer.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said this includes code generated by what Anthropic called \"agents.\" Agents are a component of AI tools that have the ability to test and rewrite code without human intervention. The function, hailed as much more autonomous than previous tools, was first introduced by Claude Code and was celebrated   by many in the industry as a pathway to automation. But agents don't always work. \"When these tools are at their best, they'll auto resolve a lot of issues. ... When they're at their worst, they will go into like death spirals,\" said Voege, describing situations where the tools, far from resolving the issue at hand, get stuck in a testing loop. \"I'm like, oh no, you're way off.\" Cherny did not shy away from describing Claude like a somewhat high functioning person. \"I think a good mental model [is that] it's like an expert programmer that's sitting next to you,\" he said. While he said it can serve as a \"thought partner\" in some cases, \"in the end, it's a human that's doing the work.\" Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who was invited to preview OpenAI's latest model, said it's plausible that AI could write a high percentages of code. However, Willison said, \"I think they'll still need the same or even more humans involved in that process.\" That's because AI cannot think through higher-level problem solving like engineers do. \"Our job is not to type code into a computer. Our job is to deliver systems that solve problems.\" Willison said. For Willison, who is known in the software world for tinkering with new tools and developing open-source ones, the productivity bump from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. \"I am comfortable saying that for certain tasks, [for] programmers who are experienced programmers — those who can work without AI — with AI, they can get two to five times [the] productivity boost, sometimes more, depending on the specific task.\" Willison later wrote in his blog that the teams that benefit the most appear to adopt best practices in software development and collaboration. But that's not always what happens in real life. People are using AI regardless of whether it's needed, which sometimes results in more work for their colleagues. Researchers coined the term \" workslop \" to describe this. \"A very high level engineer at the company was kind of very gung ho about AI coding and thought he could kind of get this very complicated project done very, very quickly on his own and tried running some AI tools,\" said one engineer at Amazon who is not authorized to speak publicly. \"[It] produced this just kind of messy blob of code that didn't work and nobody understood it. And the thing I'm working on now is just trying to actually do it kind of the old way.\" All this might explain why studies show mixed results when it comes to AI's impact. According to  a study  by AI evaluation nonprofit  METR , experienced open-source software engineers who used LLMs ended up taking 19% longer to complete their tasks compared to peers who did not — contrary to the engineers' own expectations. In a national  survey  in Denmark, software engineers self-reported to have saved 6.5% of their time with AI. It was the highest of the 11 professions, which averaged out to 2.5%. \"I'd definitely take 3% any day. It's like annual productivity growth in a typical occupation,\" said Anders Humlum, co-author of the Denmark study. \"It's not nothing, but I would call it modest relative to the experiments.\" Engineers agree that AI shines more where accuracy matters less. \"Knocking out a quick illustrated prototype would take me an hour [before] and now it takes me five minutes because I could just tell Claude to bash something [together],\" said Willison. \"The fact that it's going to make mistakes and stuff doesn't really matter too much.\" AI has helped cut back on some repetitive coding tasks at work, said Thomas Ptacek, a software developer at the cloud infrastructure company, fly.io. \"Because I've written [a piece of code] many times before … I can also look at that code very quickly and get a sense of whether it's crazy or not.\" Little room for disagreement The Amazon software engineer said management encouraged staff to use AI in all parts of their work, even when there wasn't a case for using it. \"It is very much a solution in search of problems much of the time,\" the engineer said. The engineer said that all this is fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement. \"You have to use it more and it has to make you more efficient. If you're not, then you're doing something incorrectly.\" That said, the engineer also said the rhetoric's tangible effects on work and promotion vary across the organization. Amazon isn't the only tech company that appears to make assumptions about AI's effects on code. In a memo  first reported by 404 Media and Wired , a Meta executive called for his department to achieve \"5X productivity\" in software as well as a broad set of other functions using AI. \"The more we push ourselves, the more we'll unlock,\" he wrote in the memo. Two engineers  were fired  from an AI startup in San Francisco for not using an AI coding tool enough,  The Information  reported. Both the Amazon software engineer and Voege said they aren't the only engineers skeptical of AI in their workplace. A recent Google  survey  of software engineers across different countries and industries showed that while use of AI is near universal and improves aspects of software development, about half of respondents \"somewhat\" trusted AI's response, and 30% chose \"a little\" or \"not at all.\" Many are also worried about employers replacing junior coders with AI, effectively cutting off the long-term talent supply that's needed to supervise the machines in the years to come. Others raise concerns about the massive amount of electricity and content made by humans that the largest models consume, even as dramatic capability improvements have begun to seem elusive. In a statement to NPR, Amazon spokesperson Tom Parnell said its in-house AI tools \"help engineers move faster, ship more secure code, and spend less time on busywork\" and that through surveys \"engineers tell us these tools help them save time and feel more productive.\" He also said that the company does not mandate AI use, and cannot share what percentage of its software engineers regularly use large language model tools, but it believes \"these tools can help developers work more efficiently.\" Voege has since left his job and is now again thinking about starting his own business. He was floored by how much his old funder Y Combinator has gone from supporting different kinds of technologies to focusing solely on AI. He looked at the organization's latest request for startups. \"It's just AI, AI, AI, five out of five.\" \n         \n         Correction \n         Oct. 21st, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misstated the name of Anders Humlum as Anders Hulum.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558323","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-04:00","title":"Miami Beach puts the art in offshore artificial reef","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Miami Beach is launching the Reefline project, a 7-mile-long artificial reef designed to restore a historically lost coral ecosystem.

      \n           Updated Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:01 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         MIAMI — In a warehouse, Colin Foord is a doting father overseeing a coral nursery.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       His charges are a type of soft coral called gorgonians. \"They're a fundamentally important part of the Caribbean and Floridian coral reef habitat,\" he says. Foord tends to more than 2,000 tiny soft coral specimens growing in several large saltwater tanks. In each one, snails and hermit crabs help keep it free of algae. There are sea fans, sea whips and other species, some of which will eventually grow as big as 6 feet tall when they're transplanted onto a major new project that's beginning to take shape in the Atlantic Ocean near Miami Beach. When complete,  \"Reefline\"  will be a 7-mile-long artificial reef within swimming distance of the beach. It's an art installation, a restoration of the island's coral habitat and an underwater tourist attraction. Plans call for it to extend the entire length of Miami Beach. The reef will be made up of a series of art installations — sculptures that are being cast from marine-grade concrete. Foord's passion for raising corals, the colorful colonies of tiny animals that build massive underwater reefs, is rooted in both science and art. He's one of the founders of  \"Coral Morphologic,\"  an arts and science group devoted to researching and documenting coral reefs. At his lab here, he collects and grows the corals that will be transplanted onto the Reefline project. Within a few years, the underwater concrete sculpture garden will be transformed into a colorful, living coral reef. \"It's only going to be in about 15 to 20 feet of water, about 700 feet off of Miami Beach,\" he says. \"So, anybody with a mask and fins will be able to go right out there and see it with their own eyes without even a boat.\" Reefline's origins began several years ago when Foord was talking to arts curator Ximena Caminos. Caminos, originally from Argentina, calls herself a  cultural placemaker . She's overseen projects that have used the arts to revitalize neighborhoods in  Buenos Aires  and  Miami Beach . She's turning that vision offshore to develop an ecotourism attraction that, half-jokingly, she calls public housing for fish. \"We're giving them, for free, new homes, fabulous artistic penthouses underwater where they can thrive,\" she says. \"They're not so different from us at the end, you know. They also need a home.\" Reefline is funded in part by the city of Miami Beach through a $5 million bond approved by voters. Caminos, the project's artistic director, is spearheading a campaign to raise $6 million more to fund its first phase. That gets underway this month. It will be an installation of 22 cars, cast from concrete and arranged in an underwater traffic jam. \"The cars … have the perfect morphology to plant corals,\" she says. \"The cars are kind of like flowerpots for corals. They're perfect.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This part of Reefline is the work of Leandro Ehrlich, one of several internationally known artists who's contributing to the project. He says the corals, once they're transplanted, will transform the underwater sculptures. \"I think over time, the cars are going to disappear under the growth of coral,\" Ehrlich says. \"And I think this is really fantastic.\" The Reefline project will actually bring back to Miami Beach something it used to have. Until the 1970s, the island had an offshore coral reef. Over time, it was smothered by sand brought in to replenish the beach. Foord says, \"Reefline is going to be able to … renew and re-create what used to be there.\" On the new artificial reef, Foord is planning to use resilient corals collected locally that can withstand disease and warming ocean temperatures. Caminos anticipates that completing the 7-mile-long project will take at least a decade. Part of the project will be an onshore marine learning center to educate visitors about the planet's endangered coral reefs. She says the underwater sculptures, covered by coral, are intended to be visible from the air as people fly into Miami. She's hopeful that one part of the installation's next phase, a constellation of 57 giant sculpted starfish, may even one day become a symbol for the city. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/india-diwali-hindu-festival-lights-1d8ca69601b227f4ed8c6a0b3e46486b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:50:28+00:00","title":"Millions Light Diwali Lamps in Ayodhya Amid Air Pollution Concerns","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali in 2025, with a record-breaking lighting of over 2.6 million earthen lamps on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.

The video was published as an apparent reply to the widespread  No Kings protests  that took place across the U.S. on Saturday.

Loggins continued: \"I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic. There is no 'us and them' – that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.\" There is a long history of musicians  objecting to the current president  (among  other political leaders ) using their work to send political messages. However, such use is  generally legal , as long as rights holders are paid correctly; the only use that performers and songwriters can specifically prohibit is the use of songs in campaign advertisements.

first lady, to build President Donald  Trump’s $250 million ballroom  despite lacking approval for construction from the federal agency that oversees such projects.  Dramatic photos of the demolition work showed construction equipment tearing into the East Wing façade and windows and other building parts in tatters on the ground. Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing. Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening “right behind us.” “We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,” he said, adding, “It just started today.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n \n \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n\n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The  White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project  despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats look to long term as North Carolina GOP redistricting plan seeks another seat for Trump \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ex-Amazon driver sues civil rights agency for dropping her case following Trump’s executive order \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Man charged with stalking, accused of sending Wisconsin’s chief justice intimidating emails \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump’s top aides, said at the commission’s September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n “What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,” Scharf said last month. It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency’s review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission’s offices are closed because of the government shutdown. The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of,” he said of the White House.  The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated. “Nothing will be torn down,” Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.  Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he’s adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn.  Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed “with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself. At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement.  The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so.  Trump also said at last week’s event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom.  Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,” the company said in an emailed statement.

        As deadline for Trump's colleges compact looms, schools signal dissent \n         By Elissa Nadworny  \n        \n           Monday, October 20, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to  a list of commitments  that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds. The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things. Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing. MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document \"includes principles with which we disagree,\" MIT President Sally Kornbluth  wrote in a letter  to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. \"And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Following that rejection,  President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would  be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter. Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California followed, with statements \"respectfully\" declining the offer. On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges  that hadn't yet sent rejection  notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas,  according to  The Wall Street Journal . \"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead,\"  McMahon wrote on X after the meeting . She said attendees had a \"positive and wide-ranging conversation about the Compact.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But following that meeting, two schools, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College, announced they also would not be signing on to the agreement. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think \"a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence.\" UVA said it wanted \"no special treatment\" when it comes to federal funding. \"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education,\"  wrote Paul Mahoney , the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact. UVA's previous president  resigned this summer  under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An  automated emailed response  said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats. Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cards-against-humanity-spacex-lawsuit-settlement-texas-db2ef8b5e60f80ad5e6c6b617fa120fe","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"22:32:51Z","title":"SpaceX and Cards Against Humanity Reach Land Dispute Settlement in Texas","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"SpaceX and Cards Against Humanity resolved a legal dispute over alleged trespassing and property damage on a plot of land in Cameron County, Texas, which Cards Against Humanity purchased in 2017 as a protest against President Donald Trump’s border wall initiative. The company claimed SpaceX placed construction materials and debris on the land without permission, treating it as its own for months. During discovery, SpaceX reportedly admitted to trespassing, and Cards Against Humanity stated that a trial would have cost more than it would have recovered.

Texas court records show a settlement was reached in the case last month, just weeks before a jury trial was scheduled to begin on Nov. 3. The card maker said in a statement Monday that it could not disclose the terms, and SpaceX did not return email and telephone messages left with the company and its Texas lawyer seeking comment.  Cards Against Humanity, which is headquartered in Chicago, originally  purchased the plot of land in 2017  as part of what it said was a stunt to oppose President Donald Trump’s efforts to build a border wall. In its lawsuit, Cards Against Humanity alleges SpaceX essentially treated the game company’s property — located in Cameron County in far south Texas — as its own for at least six months.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The lawsuit said SpaceX, which had previously acquired other plots of land near the property, had placed construction materials, such as gravel, and other debris on the land without asking for permission to do so.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 SpaceX launches the 11th test flight of its mega Starship rocket with another win \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 OpenAI now worth $500 billion, possibly making it the world’s most valuable startup \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Engine trouble forces Northrop Grumman to delay supply delivery to International Space Station \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Cards Against Humanity said in an email Monday to The Associated Press that SpaceX admitted during the discovery phase of the case to trespassing on its property.

One of the rarest whales on the planet has continued an encouraging trend of population growth in the wake of new efforts to protect the giant animals, according to scientists who study them. The North Atlantic right whale now numbers an estimated 384 animals, up eight whales from the previous year, according to a report by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium released Tuesday. The whales have shown a trend of slow population growth over the past four years and have gained more than 7% of their 2020 population, the consortium said. It’s a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The whale’s trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.

time when the giant animals still face threats from accidental deaths, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said. The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries  or are underfed , scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whale because they aren’t  producing enough babies  to sustain their population, they’ve said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n However, this year four mother whales had calves for the first time, Hamilton said.

And any number of calves is helpful in a year of no mortalities, said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at Cabot Center and chairs the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. “The slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,” Pettis said. ”What we’ve seen before is this population can turn on a dime.” The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades. The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food. Environmental groups warned Tuesday that the whales are still on the brink of extinction and need more aggressive protection to fully recover. “Continued attacks on the  Marine Mammal Protection Act  and efforts to weaken NOAA’s science-based safeguards put this fragile population at even greater risk. We need Congress to uphold, not undermine, the laws, programs, and experts that give North Atlantic right whales a fighting chance for continued survival,” said Gib Brogan, senior campaign director with Oceana."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/shutdown-republicans-senate-trump-white-house-8cac539f2a553ced68bc9e0b32bc7b94","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"04:01:11+00:00","title":"Government Shutdown Deepens Amid Health Care Funding Deadlock and Economic Warnings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government is in a prolonged shutdown, entering its fourth week, with 2.4 million federal workers going unpaid and key programs like Head Start and WIC at risk of closure.

federal funds. The federal agency tasked with overseeing the  U.S. nuclear stockpile  has begun furloughing its 1,400 employees. Thousands more federal workers are  going without paychecks . But as  President Donald Trump  welcomed Republican senators for lunch in the newly renovated Rose Garden Club — with construction underway on the new  White House ballroom  — he portrayed a different vision of America as a unified GOP refuses to yield to Democratic demands for health care funds, and the  government shutdown  drags on. “We have the hottest country anywhere in the world, which tells you about leadership,” Trump said in opening remarks, extolling the renovations underway as senators took their seats in the newly-paved over garden-turned patio. It was a festive atmosphere under crisp, but sunny autumn skies as senators settled in for cheeseburgers, fries and chocolates, and Trump’s favored songs — “YMCA” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” — played over the new sound system. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n And while Trump said the shutdown must come to an end — and suggested maybe Smithsonian museums could reopen — he signaled no compromise with Democrats over the expiring health care funds. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats look to long term as North Carolina GOP redistricting plan seeks another seat for Trump \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ex-Amazon driver sues civil rights agency for dropping her case following Trump’s executive order \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Man charged with stalking, accused of sending Wisconsin’s chief justice intimidating emails \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “From the beginning, our message has been very simple, we will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs,” Trump said. \n    \n     Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government.  What questions do you have for them? \n    \n \n As  the government shutdown  enters its fourth week — on track to become among the longest in U.S. history — millions of Americans are bracing for health care sticker shock while others are feeling the financial hit. Economists have warned the federal closure, leaving most of the 2.4 million-strong federal workforce without pay, will shave economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n There are few signs of any end to the stalemate. Republicans say the Democrats are holding the government hostage, beholden to far-left demands to provide billions of dollars in health care subsidies.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “People keep saying ‘negotiate’ — negotiate what?” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said after the hour-long meeting. He said Republicans and the president are willing to consider discussions over health care, “but open up the government first.” But Senate Democrats, emboldened after last weekend’s mass “No Kings” rallies against Trump’s leadership, are confident in their strategy. They have voted more than 10 times  against a House-passed bill  that would temporarily reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending  health care subsidies that expire  at the end of the year.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said as GOP senators prepared to board buses to the White House, “Apparently, they’ve got plenty of time for a mini-pep rally with Donald Trump, In the meantime, the pain for Americans is getting more and more real.” Missed paychecks and programs running out of money  While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children , known as WIC, and  Head Start  preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is  furloughing its federal workers . The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air traffic controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n At the same time, economists including Goldman Sachs and the nonpartisan CBO have warned that the federal government’s closure will ripple through the economy. More recently, Oxford Economics said a shutdown reduces economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that the Small Business Administration supports loans totaling about $860 million a week for 1,600 small businesses. Those programs close to new loans during the shutdown. The shutdown also has halted the issuance and renewal of flood insurance policies, delaying mortgage closings and real estate transactions. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Rising health care costs And without action,  future health costs  are expected to skyrocket for millions of Americans as the enhanced federal subsidies that help people buy private insurance under the Affordable Care Act, come to an end.  Those subsidies, in the form of  tax credits  that were bolstered during the COVID-19 crisis, expire Dec. 31, and insurance companies are sending out information ahead of open enrollment periods about the new rates for the coming year. Most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new  Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  poll, as they make  decisions about next year’s health coverage . Members of both parties acknowledge that time is running out to fix the looming health insurance price hikes, even as talks are quietly underway over possible extensions or changes to the ACA funding.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year’s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage  without the expanded subsidy help . Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.  What about Trump?  Tuesday’s White House meeting will be a chance for Republican senators to engage with the president on the shutdown after he has been  more involved in foreign policy and other issues . Trump had previously indicated he may be willing to discuss the health care issue, and Democrats are counting on the president turning their way. But House Speaker Mike Johnson had swiftly intervened and the president later clarified that he would only do so once the government reopens. The president last week dismissed Democratic demands as “crazy,” adding, “We’re just not going to do it.” “He needs to get off the sidelines, get off the golf course,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. “We know that House and Senate Republicans don’t do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump.” ___ Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves and Matt Brown contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/infectious-diseases-cdc-atlanta-11c4f864368f8e5aa3782ed6d06bbf0b","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:42:42Z","title":"CDC Researchers Skip IDWeek Due to Government Shutdown Amid Rising Disease Threats","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, CDC researchers were unable to attend the IDWeek conference—the largest annual gathering of infectious disease experts in the U.S.—despite the event's critical importance for discussing rising threats like measles, whooping cough, bird flu, and superbugs.

The CDC typically sends scores of researchers and outbreak investigators. But of the hundreds of speakers listed in the printed program for the four-day conference, about 10 were identified as CDC scientists. And even that small number didn’t show up. The main reason is the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. Federal scientists aren’t being paid and conference appearances are postponed unless they are funded outside of annual government budgets. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats look to long term as North Carolina GOP redistricting plan seeks another seat for Trump \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ex-Amazon driver sues civil rights agency for dropping her case following Trump’s executive order \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Man charged with stalking, accused of sending Wisconsin’s chief justice intimidating emails \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Problems were apparent long before the shutdown The Infectious Disease Society of America and its conference partners selected Atlanta, where the CDC is based, as its host more than a year ago.  Organizers were excited to have the meeting in “the heart of public health,” and CDC officials agreed to be heavily involved in planning, said Dr. Yohei Doi, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who helped organize the meeting.  But soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, there was an immediate, if temporary, freeze on CDC communications and participation at medical meetings. That was followed by layoffs and research funding cuts. “As things started to evolve, they said they no longer would be able to attend,” Doi said of CDC speakers. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Disease threats are looming The CDC’s absence comes as infectious disease specialists should be in high demand, in part because the worst pandemic in a century hit only a few years ago. Measles and  whooping cough  have been surging. And new threats are constantly emerging.  U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he wants the CDC to primarily focus on infectious diseases, though he was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before Trump appointed him to lead the federal government’s health agencies.  The CDC has already lost a quarter of its workforce through layoffs, buyouts, resignations and other actions. And the Trump administration is trying to lay off hundreds more, an effort temporarily  blocked by a federal judge . “It’s the most painful irony of all” to see these actions by the administration amid serious threats, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher. Osterholm, who spoke at the conference Sunday, said he is working with others to take on work that  the CDC has curtailed .  He announced a new open-access publication called Public Health Alerts to put out the kind of reports that were the staple of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Separately, a collaboration involving dozens of foundations would pool resources to fund some of the disease research work that the government has stopped doing, Osterholm said. “This is not business as usual anymore, but it doesn’t mean that we have to sit back and take it,” Osterholm said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Conference sponsor has clashed with Kennedy  HHS  has discouraged federal collaborations  with some medical organizations, including IDSA, and that likely had a chilling effect, said Dr. Debra Houry, who was the CDC’s chief medical officer until  she resigned in August  to protest agency changes. A HHS spokeswoman, Emily Hilliard, said the administration believes federal scientists should share their research and expertise with peers and the public, and that conferences are vetted “to ensure compliance with ethics rules and the responsible use of taxpayer funds.” Dr. Anna Yousaf, a CDC infectious disease doctor, told The Associated Press she was invited to present findings about long-term outcomes of COVID-19-infected children who develop a rare inflammatory condition. She wasn’t allowed to attend this week’s conference, though a collaborator at another organization was planning to share the research, she said. Other CDC scientists were in similar predicaments, she said, and it’s not clear how many of them could find such a workaround. That potentially means some research findings won’t be shared with researchers and physicians who could put the information to use. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Yousaf is currently on furlough due to the government shutdown, and said she was not speaking in an official capacity. “It appears to me that HHS’s goal is to prevent the dissemination of scientific information,” she said. “It’s insane.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Most recently Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. \n\n Fellow grandmasters credited Naroditsky with introducing the sport to a wider audience by livestreaming many of his matches and sharing live commentary on others.

Dutch chess grandmaster Benjamin Bok reflected on his lifelong friendship with Naroditsky, who he said he’s known since the Under 12 world championship that Naroditsky won in 2007. “I still can’t believe it and don’t want to believe it,” Bok said on X. “It was always a privilege to play, train, and commentate with Danya, but above all, to call him my friend.” Naroditsky was the son of Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Ukraine and Azerbaijan. He was born and raised in San Mateo County, California, and was described by his parents as a very serious kid with an impressive attention span and memory. He went on to study history at Stanford University, earning a bachelor’s degree in 2019 after taking a year off to play in chess tournaments.  After college, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he coached the area’s top junior chess players. ___ This story has been corrected to show that it is the Charlotte Chess Center, not the Charlotte Chess Club."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/japan-first-female-prime-minister-vote-trump-24b4a5e2a2b777139de66e38665ced0d","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"00:43:45+00:00","title":"Japan Elected First Female Prime Minister in Historic Political Shift","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sanae Takaichi has been elected as Japan’s first female prime minister, following electoral defeats that weakened the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party.

country’s first female prime minister, and she underlined her commitment to boosting Japanese defense as she prepared to host visiting U.S. President Donald Trump next week.  Takaichi replaces outgoing Shigeru Ishiba after the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered disastrous losses in July elections for parliament’s upper house and lost its majority in the lower house last year. Her election comes a day after the LDP struck a deal in a fragile coalition with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.  “I’m determined to build a strong Japanese economy and protect Japan’s national interest with diplomacy and security,” said Takaichi, a security hawk who was elected head of the LDP on Oct. 4 after Ishiba resigned to take responsibility for the latest election defeat.  Takaichi cited the Japan-U.S. alliance as a “cornerstone” of Japanese diplomacy and stressed that Japan is an indispensable partner for America in its strategy to provide counterweights to China in the Indo-Pacific region. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next Monday to Wednesday. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A first, but not a feminist While Takaichi made history by becoming the first female leader of a country where men still largely hold sway, she has not promoted gender equality or diversity.  An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is among the Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women’s advancement. She supports the imperial family’s  male-only succession , and opposes allowing separate  surnames  for married couples.  And despite a pledge to drastically increase the number of women in the Cabinet, she appointed only two woman ministers — Satsuki Katayama as finance minister and Kimi Onoda as economic security minister. Takaichi also opposes  same-sex marriage.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The birth of Japan’s first female prime minister is epoch-making, but she casts a dark cloud over gender equality and sexual minority rights,” LGBTQ+ rights activist Soshi Matsuoka said, adding that Takaichi’s “extremely conservative” views could be a “serious setback” for the rights of sexual minorities. However, some Japanese feel that her breaking the glass ceiling in politics is an important marker of progress in itself. Takayuki Eguchi, a 62-year-old Tokyo resident, said he had doubted that a woman would even be able to get enough votes in parliament. He celebrated Takaichi’s achievement by collecting a free special newspaper edition distributed on Tuesday.  “I really hope she serves for a long time, and that the political stagnation we’ve been seeing finally starts to move, and that things improve in Japan and in the eyes of the world,” Eguchi said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A fragile governing alliance The LDP’s alliance with the Osaka-based right-wing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, is short of a majority in both houses, but Takaichi was still able to win the premiership because the opposition is not united.  Her alliance’s lack of a majority will mean that it will need to court opposition groups to pass any legislation — a risk that could make her government unstable and short-lived. Takaichi on Tuesday stressed the need to cooperate. “Without political stability, we cannot achieve strong economic policies, diplomacy, security or anything,” she said.  Her coalition’s two parties signed agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi’s hawkish and nationalistic views. Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost the party’s longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed  Komeito , which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Her challenges  Takaichi is preparing for a major policy speech later this week,  talks with Trump  and regional summits during which she also needs to ensure stable ties with China and South Korea. She needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economy-boosting measures by late December to address public frustration. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe , Takaichi is expected to emulate his policies, including a stronger military and economy. With her potentially weak grip on power, it’s not clear how much Takaichi will be able to achieve. Developing friendly ties with Trump might be a challenge, but her close ties and admiration of Abe, who apparently had won Trump’s trust, may help her. “At first, I hope to develop relations of trust between the two leaders through candid exchange of views about the challenges that Japan and the United States face,” Takaichi said. Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 and has served in senior posts including as minister of economic security and internal affairs, but her diplomatic background is thin. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Concerns about her nationalism When Komeito left the governing coalition, it raised concern about Takaichi’s view of Japan’s wartime past. She has taken part in regular prayers at the  Yasukuni Shrine  despite protests from Beijing and Seoul, which see the visits as a sign of lack of remorse for Japanese aggression. Some of Takaichi’s remarks have also been denounced as xenophobic. Takaichi, who is pro-Taiwan, has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament to Yasukuni instead of going there herself. On Tuesday, she said she wants stable ties with Seoul and hopes to meet with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. “There may be worries, but I love Korean seaweed, I use Korean cosmetics, and I watch Korean dramas too.” China, South Korea and EU react South Korea’s president congratulated Takaichi and said he hopes to hold a summit with her during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in South Korea this month. He said South Korea-Japan relations are more important than ever as global uncertainty deepens. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said that he hoped Japan would “honor its political commitments on major issues including on history and Taiwan, maintain the political foundation of bilateral relations and advance the China-Japan strategic relations of mutual benefit.” China considers Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, its own breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Takaichi and pledged to work with her on behalf of the 27-nation European Union. “As Japan’s first female PM, you’re making history,” von der Leyen wrote. “I look forward to working closely together to take the unique-EU Japan partnership to the next level.” ___ AP journalists Mayuko Ono and Reeno Hashimoto in Tokyo, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Simina Mistreanu in Taipei, Taiwan and Sam McNeil in Brussels contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peanut-allergy-children-infants-anaphylaxis-9a6df6377a622d05e47c340c5a9cffc8","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"04:01:17+00:00","title":"New Research Shows Early Peanut Introduction Has Reduced Allergy Rates in U.S. Children","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A decade after a landmark study by Gideon Lack at King’s College London demonstrated that early introduction of peanuts to infants could prevent life-threatening food allergies, new research shows that this public health intervention has made a measurable impact.

landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could  prevent development  of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world. Peanut allergies began to decline in the U.S. after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. The rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. “That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study  published Monday  in the medical journal Pediatrics.

For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking  Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,  or LEAP, trial. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. “This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education, or FARE. The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. “It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietitian and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her two young sons. At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. “As a dietitian, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.” ___ This story has been corrected to report that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies after doctors began recommending introducing the peanuts to babies, not 60,000.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

getting a tip from his family that he was planning to shoot up the place, and found an assault rifle and ammunition in his truck outside, the city’s police chief said. Billy Joe Cagle, of Cartersville, Georgia, had described his plan to shoot up the world’s  busiest airport  on a social media livestream, Chief Darin Schierbaum said during a news conference. “The Cartersville Police Department was alerted by the family of Mr. Cagle that he was streaming on social media that he was headed to the Atlanta airport, in their words, to ‘shoot it up,’ and the family stated that he was in possession of an assault rifle,” Schierbaum said, describing Cagle as a “convicted felon.” Cagle, 49, arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in a Chevrolet pickup truck that was parked right outside the doors to the airport terminal. When police went to the vehicle, they found an AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition, Schierbaum said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “We’re here today briefing you on a success and not a tragedy because a family saw something and said something,” the chief said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Democrats look to long term as North Carolina GOP redistricting plan seeks another seat for Trump \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The Louvre’s crown jewel heist is now a race against time for authorities — and the brazen thieves \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Ex-Amazon driver sues civil rights agency for dropping her case following Trump’s executive order \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Cartersville police Capt.

Cagle was booked into the Clayton County Detention Facility on Monday evening, according to online jail records. Attempts to reach his family and co-workers through multiple phone numbers and emails were unsuccessful. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had a lawyer who could comment on the charges. Nick Roberts, who has known Cagle since high school, texted his friend Sunday night after being concerned by Facebook posts he had made. He said Cagle was struggling with mental health issues. Cagle had posted on Facebook earlier Sunday that he is schizophrenic and was taking medication. Roberts said Cagle called him at about 9 p.m. Sunday night and assured him he was OK. Roberts said Cagle loved his two daughters and worked hard hauling hay and doing fencing work. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I want folks to know that he wasn’t some monster,” Roberts said. “This was a very big surprise for a lot of us that went to high school with him and know him in the community.” Atlanta police will work with federal authorities to determine how he obtained the gun, “which he was not able to legally possess,” Schierbaum said.

2025-10-20T12:59:15+00:00\n\nLONDON (AP) — Amazon says a massive outage of its  cloud computing service  has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms. The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it  suddenly breaks down . About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was  starting to recover , but it wasn’t until 6 p.m. Eastern that “services returned to normal operations,” Amazon said on its  AWS health  website, where it tracks outages.  AWS provides behind-the-scenes cloud computing infrastructure to some of the world’s biggest organizations. Its customers include government departments, universities and businesses, including The Associated Press. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said “a slow and bumpy recovery process” is “entirely normal.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about the Amazon cloud outage that exposed the internet’s vulnerable backbone \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Texas camp owners want more flexibility in meeting safety, licensing requirements after drownings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Silicon Valley leader who navigated the internet’s boom and bust sees another wild ride with AI \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n As engineers roll out fixes across the cloud computing infrastructure, the process could trigger smaller disruptions, he said. “It’s similar to what happens after a large-scale power outage: While a city’s power is coming back online, neighborhoods may see intermittent glitches as crews finish the repairs,” said Chapple, an information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Amazon blames domain name system Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices. DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. Users reported trouble with the social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games, the online broker Robinhood and the McDonald’s app, as well as Netflix, Disney+ and many other services. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Signal chat app both said on X that they were experiencing trouble related to the outage. Amazon’s own services were also affected. Users of the company’s Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers reported that they were not working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle. Many college and K-12 students were unable to submit or access their homework or course materials Monday because the AWS outage knocked out Canvas, a widely used educational platform. “I currently can’t grade any online assignments, and my students can’t access their online materials” because of the outage’s effect on learning-management systems, said Damien P. Williams, a professor of philosophy and data science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The exact number of schools impacted was not immediately known, but Canvas says on its website it is used by 50% of college and university students in North America, including all Ivy League schools in the U.S. At the University of California, Riverside, students couldn’t submit assignments, take quizzes or access course materials, and online instruction was limited, the campus said. Ohio State University informed its 70,000 students at all six campuses by email Monday morning that online course materials might be inaccessible due to the outage and that “students should connect with their instructors for any alternative plans.” As of 7:10 p.m. Eastern, access was restored, the university told students. Record of past outages This is not the first time issues with Amazon cloud services have caused widespread disruptions. Many popular internet services were affected by a brief  outage in 2023 . AWS’s longest outage in recent history occurred in late 2021, when a wide range of companies — from airlines and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services — were affected for  more than five hours . Outages also happened in 2020 and  2017 . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The first signs of trouble emerged at around 3:11 a.m. Eastern time, when AWS reported on its “health dashboard” that it was “investigating increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.” Later, the company reported that there were “significant error rates” and that engineers were “actively working” on the problem. Around 6 a.m. Eastern time, the company reported seeing recovery across most of the affected services and said it was seeking a “full resolution.” As of midday, AWS was still working to resolve the trouble. Sixty-four internal AWS services were affected, the company said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Just a few companies provide most internet infrastructure Because much of the world now relies on three or four companies to provide the underlying infrastructure of the internet, “when there’s an issue like this, it can be really impactful” across many online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. “The world now runs on the cloud,” Burgess said. And because so much of the online world’s plumbing is underpinned by so few companies, when something goes wrong, “it’s very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don’t see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,” Burgess said. “The good news is that this kind of issue is usually relatively fast” to resolve, and there’s no indication that it was caused by a cyberattack, Burgess said. “This looks like a good old-fashioned technology issue. Something’s gone wrong, and it will be fixed by Amazon,” he said. There are “well-established processes” to deal with outages at AWS, as well as rivals Google and Microsoft, Burgess said, adding that such outages are usually over in “hours rather than days.” ___ Ortutay reported from San Francisco.

The NBA season opens Tuesday,  and the league’s opening night rosters show a record 135 players who were born outside the U.S. They come from 43 countries — tying a record — and 71 are from Europe, the most ever from that continent. That development comes with the NBA in talks, along with FIBA — the sport’s global governing body — to develop a new league in Europe, something that  could happen as early as 2027. “The state of the game of basketball in Europe I think is fantastic,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month. “They have their own traditions, which we of course want to maintain, but we think there’s an opportunity to bring an NBA-style league to the continent and to take the game to another level.” Canada has the most non-U.S. players with 23, followed by 19 from France and 13 from Australia. And the Atlanta Hawks are opening the season with 10 international players on their roster, tying an NBA record. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n All 30 teams have at least one international player on their opening night rosters.

At this point, every time Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James plays he updates league records. He’s the NBA’s all-time leader in points and minutes and has a few more milestones in his sights this season. — His first game of the year will officially make this his 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the most in NBA history by a player. — If he plays in 50 games, he’ll break the record of 1,611 (regular season only) held by Robert Parish. — If he makes 350 field goals, he’ll break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s mark of 15,837. Milestones on the way — James Harden of the Los Angeles Clippers has 27,687 points in his career and needs 603 more points to pass Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony for 10th on the NBA’s all-time list. — Sacramento’s Russell Westbrook needs 75 assists to become the eighth player in NBA history with 10,000. — Indiana coach Rick Carlisle is seven wins shy of 1,000 in his career. He’ll be the 11th coach to get it and probably the last for at least a few more years; Miami’s Erik Spoelstra enters this season with 787 wins. — Spoelstra is nine wins shy of passing Red Auerbach for the most wins coaching one team. Auerbach won 795 with the Celtics; only Gregg Popovich (1,390 with San Antonio) and Jerry Sloan (1,127 with Utah) had more wins with one franchise. — Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers has been on the sideline for 1,978 games, which is eighth-most — for now — in league history. If he coaches the full season, he’ll climb to No. 4 on the all-time games coached list, passing Bill Fitch (2,050), Jerry Sloan (2,024), Larry Brown (2,002) and George Karl (1,999). No. 1 on that list is Lenny Wilkens (2,487), No. 2 is Don Nelson (2,318) and No. 3 is Gregg Popovich (2,214). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n — Denver, Brooklyn, Indiana and San Antonio will all play their 4,000th all-time NBA game this season.

Based on last year’s average of about 228 points per game being scored, it’ll take somewhere around 200 games this season for someone to reach the milestone.  That means it’ll happen somewhere around Nov. 17, give or take a day or two either way. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Name game Among the name highlights in the NBA this season, based on the opening night rosters: — There are seven Jordans (Boston’s Jordan Walsh, the Los Angeles Clippers’ Jordan Miller, New Orleans’ Jordan Hawkins and Jordan Poole, New York’s Jordan Clarkson, Phoenix’s Jordan Goodwin and San Antonio’s Jordan McLaughlin). Combined, they’re about 10,000 points behind Michael Jordan’s career total. — There are five players named Nikola (Denver’s Nikola Jokic, Miami’s Nikola Jovic, Oklahoma City’s Nikola Topic, Atlanta’s Nikola Durisic and Chicago’s Nikola Vucevic). — There are five James (the Lakers’ LeBron and Bronny James, the Clippers’ James Harden, Indiana’s James Wiseman and Charlotte’s Sion James). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n — Orlando Robinson might be the only player in the league who’ll wear his first name on the front of his jersey and his last name on the back. He has a two-way deal with the Magic. — The Bucks have three Antetokounmpo brothers: Giannis, Thanasis and two-way player Alex. The Nets are young. Really young The Brooklyn Nets are young. So young, in fact, that they don’t have anyone on their roster who ranks among the league’s top 100 active scorers headed into this season. The numbers are wild when put into perspective. Players on the Nets’ opening night roster have combined for 21,708 points and 1,018 starts at this point in their careers. There are eight active players — LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard — with more points than the Nets’ roster starts this season with. James, Paul, DeRozan, Mike Conley, Durant, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook, Brook Lopez and Stephen Curry all have more starts. James, Andre Drummond and Nikola Vucevic have more rebounds than everyone on the Nets roster. Curry — the NBA’s all-time 3-point king — leads a group of six players with more 3s than the Nets, while there are 10 players with more steals and 26 players with more assists. The leading scorer on the Nets’ roster right now is Michael Porter Jr., with 5,597 points in his career to this point. ___ AP NBA:  https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-campus-assault-facebook-ian-cleary-079f3654d9244ab988929b98462b77e4","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"15:56:52+00:00","title":"Man Sentenced to 2-4 Years in Prison for 2013 Campus Sexual Assault After Decades-Long Legal Fight","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man, Ian Cleary, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman, Shannon Keeler, at Gettysburg College in 2013.

(AP) — A man who sent a Facebook message that said,  “So I raped you,”  to a woman he had sexually assaulted in college in 2013 was sentenced to two to four years in prison on Monday. The sentence came more than a year after Ian Cleary was extradited back to Pennsylvania from France over the assault at Gettysburg College and nearly 12 years after the victim first went to police. The judge took into account Cleary’s  guilty plea , his remorse and his long history of mental illness in giving a sentence below state guidelines. Cleary, 32, said he sent the messages as part of a 12-step program, in hopes of seeking atonement. Victim Shannon Keeler told the court on Monday that the messages only reopened wounds she had long carried over the assault, which went years without being prosecuted. “The system meant to protect me protected you instead,” said Keeler, detailing in a powerful 10-minute impact statement the years she spent pursuing charges, which prosecutors are often reluctant to file in campus sexual assault cases. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “This isn’t just my story, this is the story of countless women,” she said. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The Louvre’s crown jewel heist is now a race against time for authorities — and the brazen thieves \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Appeals court overturns conviction of Colombian ex-President Uribe for bribery and witness tampering \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Paris prosecutor says stolen Louvre jewels worth an estimated $102 million \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Cleary faced a maximum of 10 years in prison for the attack, and the two sides had initially proposed a four- to eight-year sentence.  \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n Andrea Levy, Keeler’s lawyer, said the sentence was “less than what we expected and certainly less than he deserves,” but she said there was relief that the case was over. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Keeler told police that Cleary sneaked into her dorm on the eve of winter break, when few people were left on campus, then pushed his way into her room and assaulted her. She was an 18-year-old in her first semester on campus at the time. Senior Judge Kevin Hess said that anyone with daughters or, like him, granddaughters in college would find the crime “horrifying.”  Nevertheless, he said, “the defendant has admitted his guilt, he’s come forward and even though 10 to 11 alarming years have passed in the meantime, we wouldn’t be here today but for his hope for some kind of forgiveness and contrition.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Cleary left Gettysburg after the attack and ultimately finished college in Silicon Valley, California, where he’d grown up. He then got a master’s degree and worked for Tesla before moving overseas. In 2019, he sent the Facebook message to Keeler, and she renewed her efforts with police and prosecutors after noticing them a few months later. In 2021,  she shared her experience  in an Associated Press story on the reluctance of prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes. Cleary was indicted weeks after the AP story was published, and following a three-year search, he was extradited from Metz, France, where he had been detained on a vagrancy-related charge in April 2024. In court Monday, Cleary, standing just a few feet away, apologized to Keeler and his father. “I’m committed to getting treatment for mental health and stuff like that as I go forward,” he said. Cleary’s family members have declined to comment on the case and did not attend most of his court hearings.  Keeler, in interviews with the AP, described her repeated efforts to persuade authorities to press charges, starting hours after the assault.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I had been thinking about this moment for 12 years,” Keeler said after seeing Cleary in court in July, when he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault. She called it a surreal moment. Authorities in the U.S. and Europe tried to  track Cleary down  after the indictment but seemed unable to follow his trail, online or otherwise, until his arrest in the unrelated case. Defense lawyer John Abom maintained that Cleary was homeless at times and unaware of the charges. Adams County District Attorney Brian Sinnett said he had his doubts but could not prove that Cleary was on the run. The AP typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Keeler has done. “The system that failed me a decade ago finally delivered accountability, but at a cost. Evidence was lost. Time passed,” she told the court Monday, noting that results of the rape kit she was given that night had been destroyed by the time of the indictment.  “My life moved on, but the impact never went away, not for me, not for my family, not for anyone who had to watch this unfold again and again,” she said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-21-2025-29925b9671834bba6e24adb5f2e35b51","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"New Cabinet Formation and Policy Initiatives in 2023: A Political Overview","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2023, a new cabinet was formed following the announcement of the government's reorganization on March 20.

Vance noted  flareups of violence in recent days  but said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that began on Oct. 10 is going “better than I expected.” The Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, added that “we are exceeding where we thought we would be at this time.” They visited a new center in Israel for civilian and military cooperation as questions remain over the long-term plan for peace, including when and how an international security force will deploy to Gaza and who will govern the territory after the war.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Vance tried to downplay any idea that his visit — his first as vice president — was urgently arranged to keep the ceasefire in place.

decision. Israeli media said Hanegbi had opposed the renewal of Israel’s Gaza offensive in March, and Israel’s failed attempt to assassinate Hamas’ leadership in an airstrike in Qatar in September. In a statement, Hanegbi noted “times of disagreement” with Netanyahu.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hamas hands over remains of 2 more hostages Late Tuesday, Israel’s military said it had received the remains of two more hostages in Gaza, and that they were being transferred back to Israel for identification. Since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the remains of 13 hostages have been returned to Israel. After these latest remains arrive in Israel, another 13 still need to be recovered in Gaza and handed over. On his visit to Israel Tuesday, Vance urged a “little bit of patience” amid Israeli frustration with Hamas’ pace of returning the hostages. “Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are,” Vance said. Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It said Tuesday that Israel had so far transferred 165 bodies since earlier this month. As he faced journalists’ questions over the ceasefire’s next steps, he said “a lot of this work is very hard” and urged flexibility. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Once we’ve got to a point where both the Gazans and our Israeli friends can have some measure of security, then we’ll worry about what the long-term governance of Gaza is,” he said. “Let’s focus on security, rebuilding, giving people some food and medicine.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Vice President J.D.

Residents said prices for essential goods soared on Sunday after militants killed two Israeli soldiers and Israel responded with strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel also threatened to halt humanitarian aid. At a market in the central city of Deir al-Balah, a 25-kilogram (55-pound) package of flour was selling for more than $70 on Sunday, up from about $12 shortly after the ceasefire. By Tuesday, the price was around $30. Mohamed al-Faqawi, a Khan Younis resident, accused merchants of taking advantage of the perilous security situation. “They are exploiting us,” he said. On Monday, Hamas said its security forces raided shops across Gaza, closing some and forcing merchants to lower prices. Hamas also has allowed aid trucks to move safely and halted  looting of  deliveries. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Nahed Sheheiber, head of Gaza’s private truckers’ union, said there was no stealing aid since the ceasefire started. But other significant challenges remain as Gaza’s  financial system is in tatters . With nearly every bank branch and ATM inoperable, people pay exorbitant commissions to a network of cash brokers to get money for daily expenses. On Tuesday, dozens of people in Deir al-Balah spent hours in line at the Bank of Palestine hoping to access their money but were turned away. “Without having the bank open and without money, it does not matter that the prices (in the market) have dropped,” said Kamilia Al-Ajez. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Israeli soldiers move on top of a tank along the Israeli-Gaza border as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

Dr. Muneer al-Boursh, the health ministry’s general director, said on social media late Monday that some had evidence of being bound with ropes and metal shackles, and had deep wounds and crushed limbs. It was not immediately clear if any of the bodies had been prisoners; they are returned without identification or details on how they died. The bodies could include Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken out of Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. The Israel Prisons Service denied that prisoners had been mistreated, saying it had followed legal procedures and provided medical care and “adequate living conditions.” Israeli hostages released from Gaza have also reported metal shackles and harsh conditions, including frequent beatings and starvation. In the 2023 attack on Israel that started the war, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people as hostages. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lidman from Tel Aviv.

Sarkozy  will become the first former French president in living memory to be imprisoned when he is expected to begin  a five-year sentence  Tuesday in Paris’ La Santé prison. Convicted of criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya, Sarkozy maintains his innocence. Regardless, he will be admitted to  serve his time in a prison  that has held some of the most high-profile inmates since the 19th century. They include Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, wrongly convicted of treason because he was Jewish, and the Venezuelan militant known as Carlos the Jackal, who carried out several attacks on French soil.  Sarkozy told Le Figaro newspaper that he expects to be held in solitary confinement, where he would be kept away from all other prisoners for security reasons. Another possibility is that he is held in the prison’s section for “vulnerable″ inmates, colloquially known as the VIP section. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Former La Santé inmates described their experiences and what the former president might expect to face.

I’ll hold my head high, including in front of the doors of La Santé,” Sarkozy told La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. “I’ll fight till the end.” La Tribune Dimanche reports Sarkozy has his prison bag ready with clothes and 10 family photos he is allowed to bring. Sarkozy also told Le Figaro newspaper he would bring three books — the maximum allowed — including “The Count of Monte Cristo” in two volumes and a biography of Jesus Christ. The hero of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” by French author Alexandre Dumas, escapes from an island prison where he spent 14 years before seeking revenge.  One of Sarkozy’s sons, Louis, called for a rally Tuesday morning in support of his father in the high-end Paris neighborhood where Sarkozy lives with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. The supermodel-turned-singer has shared photos of Sarkozy’s children and songs in his honor on her social media feeds since his conviction. Under the ruling, the 70-year-old Sarkozy will only be able to file a request for release to the appeals court once he is behind bars, and judges will then have up to two months to process the request. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n 9-square-meter cells The National Financial Prosecutor’s office told Sarkozy the specifics of his detention last Monday, but details have not been made public. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin confirmed that Sarkozy will enter La Santé on Tuesday and that he’ll personally visit him to make sure security conditions are met.  In the so-called VIP section, Sarkozy could have his own room in one of 18 identical 9-square-meter cells (96.8 square feet) in a wing separated from other general prison inmates.  Botton, who says he has known Sarkozy for decades, expressed doubt that the former president will be accorded many special privileges in prison. “Even if you are president of the Republic, even if you are a very rich man, you decide nothing.” Based on his own experience inside La Santé, about which he wrote the book “QB4,″ Botton described what Sarkozy might expect. After being processed, convicts are handed personal kit by the guards and then led to their cells. “They will open the cell, and (Sarkozy) will discover where he will go,” he said. Botton described the cell he’d lived in La Santé: “A small 70-centimeter (2 feet 4 inches) bed fixed to the floor, a hot plate, a pay refrigerator, a pay TV.” He said that inmates’ rooms in the VIP section were equipped with fixed landline phones they can use to make calls, which are recorded by prison authorities, but they cannot receive calls on the same line. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The shock of incarceration Patrick Balkany, a longtime friend of Sarkozy who spent five months in La Santé for tax evasion in 2019-2020, described the first hours of newly admitted inmates. “They’re going to take his photo, to make him a card because over there we’re a number, we’re no longer a person with a name,” he told RTL radio. Then, “if he’s considered like any other inmate, he undresses and his clothes are searched to make sure he doesn’t have any prohibited items on him,” Balkany said. “The hardest part is when you arrive in your cell, it’s a shock,” he added.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Botton, also, recalled the shock he experienced when his affluent life crumbled when he was sent to prison the first time. “I went for my first time from my 1,200 square meter (around 13,000 square feet) mansion to 9 square meters,’' he said.  From having a private staff of 11 people outside prison, he found himself cleaning a filthy cell when he arrived, he said. “That’s what we call the shock of incarceration.’' “When you are at 7 p.m., you are in jail, alone, and you heard that everything is locked, you are alone,” Botton says. “Everything is finished. The game is finished.” ___ AP writer Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-rodrigo-paz-election-quiroga-530aee50c6d63281941079460891da4f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"07:17:18+00:00","title":"Rodrigo Paz wins presidential runoff, becoming Bolivia’s first conservative leader in decades","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rodrigo Paz, Bolivia’s first conservative president in 20 years, won a decisive 54.5% of the vote in a runoff election, ending decades of leftist rule under the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party.

However, Paz faces challenges including a deepening fuel subsidy crisis, soaring inflation (23% in September), and public skepticism over the election results, especially after past fraud allegations during Evo Morales’ 2019 re-election. The new administration is committed to reforming Bolivia’s judiciary and restoring institutional integrity, particularly to address concerns from the Indigenous majority that have been politically empowered under Morales.

a sharp note of realism into his plans to tackle an economic crisis Monday, a  day after his surprise electoral victory  signaled the  end of decades of leftist rule in the South American nation. After years of government antipathy  toward the U.S. under the Movement Toward Socialism party, Paz pledged to rebuild relations with Washington — and attract foreign investment to a country long locked out of international markets. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Paz’s victory Sunday “marks a transformative opportunity for both nations” to work on investment, immigration, security and other matters.  “The message from Mr. Trump’s administration itself is a very clear and open signal,” Paz said at a news conference. “We will have a fluid relationship and commitments to cooperation and joint work between both nations.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In another sign of the dramatic regional shift, Paz held a video call with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won  the Nobel Peace Prize this month . After years of Bolivia aligning itself with Venezuela’s  increasingly repressive  President Nicolás Maduro, Paz told Machado that his country was “here to join in the fight for Venezuela and for Latin American democracies.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 What to know about Rodrigo Paz, the centrist who shot from obscurity to Bolivia’s presidency \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Rodrigo Paz wins presidential runoff, becoming Bolivia’s first conservative leader in decades \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 After years of socialist rule, Bolivia’s presidential runoff tests how far and fast it veers right \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n “These are very difficult times; here we have achieved a great step,” he said of Bolivia’s break with socialism.

Quiroga pitched having the International Monetary Fund  impose a fiscal shock package to right the economy, an unpopular move with many voters. Sensitive to the country’s deep-seated resentment of such international organizations under leftist rule, Paz rejected an IMF bailout. He did reveal Monday that he was talking to the Trump administration — among “other friendly countries” — to ensure Bolivia would have fuel imports after he takes office. “The process is underway. We are coordinating in the best way possible so that the much-needed fuel — gasoline and diesel — can arrive, and from that, we can bring calm to the population,” Paz said, without elaborating.  The commodities boom of the early 2000s sent money flowing into Bolivia under then-  President Evo Morales  as natural gas exports surged. But production slumped and, amid profligate spending on subsidies,  the central bank has practically run out of U.S. dollars .  Without the cash to pay for imports, fuel lines stretch along the streets of major cities. Year-on-year  inflation soared  to 23% in September, the highest rate since 1991.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n An underdog lures former leftists to the right Paz — the son of former leftist President Jaime Paz Zamora — was a political unknown in the early stages of the campaign despite his two decades in politics, first as a mayor, then as a senator. But his pick as a running mate of Edman Lara,  a social media-savvy former police captain, transformed his campaign, solidifying his appeal to working-class and rural voters who saw themselves in Lara’s own humble origin story and in his public struggles against what they see as a corrupt establishment.  Lara gained fame on TikTok in 2023 after being fired from the police force for denouncing corruption in viral videos.  Lara made populist promises like pension increases and cash handouts for the poor that flew in the face of Paz’s grim economic arithmetic, but he helped differentiate Paz from Quiroga and whipped up excitement among many Bolivians who once belonged to the MAS party. Morales, who governed for 14 years and was barred from this race due to a  contentious court ruling on term limits , warned Paz and Lara on Monday that winning the votes of his former followers comes at a price. “It does not give you a blank check,” Morales said. “It is a vote with a mandate ... not to apply neoliberal measures, not to submit to imperialism, not to be repressive, not to criminalize protest.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Saving finances from the brink of disaster On Monday, Paz spoke soberly about the importance of cleaning house and restoring faith in Bolivia’s corruption-riddled institutions before making any splashy promises. The leader of Paz’s economic team, José Gabriel Espinoza, told the AP that cash handouts for the poor were still financially feasible to help cushion the blow of lifting the country’s expensive fuel subsidies.  Espinoza said that Congress had already approved a $3.5 billion loan to be disbursed over the coming months and that Paz is working on another $600 million to balance the books within the first 60 days of his presidency.  “Today we have a blind subsidy, we subsidize fuel for everyone. So what we’ll do is target the subsidy to poorer families through direct cash transfers, while keeping gasoline prices stable for transport workers,” said Espinoza.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Putting the house in order When asked how he would draw foreign investment and take on foreign debt, Paz repeated: “First you put the house in order quickly.” That involves changing Bolivia’s Constitution, he said, a prospect that has stirred fears among the country’s Indigenous majority who finally found political representation in the 2005 election of MAS party founder Morales as  the country’s first Indigenous president . Under Morales, a 2009 constitution gave Indigenous and other grassroots groups a bigger role in electoral politics and decision-making after years of being treated as second-class citizens by Bolivia’s largely white and mestizo, or mixed-race, minority. The constitution also overhauled the judicial system, making it more vulnerable to political influence.  Paz promised that his government would respect its commitment to the Indigenous majority but prioritize  changes in a judiciary  that for years has been seen as a political prize to be won rather than a check on government power. He pledged to convene a summit to produce concrete proposals the day after his inauguration.  To contain any frustration at his inability to fulfill his promises in the short term while pushing through difficult reforms, experts say that Paz will need to show the negotiating powers that he boasted of in his campaign. He appeared aware of that in Monday’s news conference, saying that he and Lara “have extended our hand to all political forces in Parliament.” The street may be another matter.  Late Monday, scattered protests against the election result erupted outside the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in Bolivia’s capital of La Paz. Scores of Quiroga supporters wrapped themselves in national flags and chanted “Fraud, fraud, fraud!” Local media aired footage of other protests igniting in the prosperous eastern region of Santa Cruz. “I don’t trust it at all,” said Shelly Sánchez, 48, one of the protesters in La Paz, explaining that she lost faith in Bolivia’s electoral politics after  Morales’ disputed 2019 reelection  that  sparked suspicions of fraud  and prompted mass protests that  led to his ouster  under pressure from the military.  “They’re all the same.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/maccabi-tel-aviv-aston-villa-fan-ban-00616ea0fbcef57c80fcecb100bbdbd6","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"07:24:31+00:00","title":"Maccabi Tel Aviv Declines Tickets for Europa League Match Against Aston Villa Amid Fan Ban Controversy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Maccabi Tel Aviv has declined to offer tickets to its fans for a scheduled Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham, citing the safety and wellbeing of its fans after past violent incidents involving antisemitic behavior during previous matches, especially against Ajax in Amsterdam.

game against Aston Villa next month regardless of growing calls for the English city of Birmingham to reverse a  ban  imposed on the Israeli club’s fans. West Midlands Police last week deemed the Nov. 6 match at Villa Park to be high risk and cited violence and hate crimes that took place when Maccabi Tel Aviv played at Ajax  in Amsterdam last season . The subsequent ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans for the Villa game attracted widespread criticism, including from British Prime Minister  Keir Starmer,  who said it was the  wrong decision . In a  statement posted on social media  late Monday, Maccabi Tel Aviv acknowledged the efforts to overturn the ban but added: “The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ?

There is no history of violence between Aston Villa and Maccabi fans. However, Maccabi fans have been increasingly in the spotlight over the past year or so, partly linked to the war in Gaza. Most notably, Maccabi fans clashed violently with city residents in Amsterdam last season when the team visited for a Europa League game against Ajax.  Dozens were arrested and five people were treated in a hospital following the  night of violence  which was condemned as antisemitic by authorities and which also saw some supporters of the Israeli team chanting anti-Arab slogans. In Italy last week there was a heavy police presence,  including snipers on the roof  of the stadium, for a World Cup qualifier between Italian and Israeli national teams after authorities placed the game in the highest risk category.  And last Sunday, dozens of people were injured after rioting soccer fans at a domestic league derby game in Tel Aviv threw flares and smoke grenades. The game at the Bloomfield Stadium between city rivals Hapoel and Maccabi was eventually  abandoned  out of concern for public safety, police said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Nov. 6 encounter at Villa Park is set to be Maccabi’s first away match in the Europa League, European soccer’s second-tier competition, since pro-Palestinian protests took place at the stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece,  when the club played PAOK  on Sept. 24. About 120 Maccabi fans traveled to Greece for that game and were held behind a police cordon before entering the venue. European soccer’s governing body UEFA was  weighing a vote  to suspend Israeli teams from its competitions before  that was overtaken this month  by the  ceasefire in Gaza .  Maccabi reaction In the club statement, Maccabi Tel Aviv said soccer should bring people together, not divide them. “We have been instrumental in bringing forward footballing talent from around the world irrespective of race or creed. Our first team squad consists of Muslims, Christian and Jewish players and our fan base also crosses the ethnic and religious divide,” the statement said, adding that the club had been “working tirelessly to stamp out racism within the more extreme elements of our fan base.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The statement said there were critics who sought to “malign” Maccabi fans. “We hope that circumstances will change and look forward to being able to play in Birmingham in a sporting environment in the near future,” the club said. Basketball decision Europe’s top basketball clubs met in Barcelona on Tuesday and agreed to a proposal that will see games resuming in Israel on Dec. 1 “following the recently announced ceasefire and peace initiatives.” Matches in the EuroLeague and EuroCup that would typically be played in Israel have been relocated to neutral venues since October 2023. “Until then,” read a  Euroleague Basketball statement , “Euroleague Basketball will continue to carefully monitor developments, stay in close contact with local and foreign authorities, visiting teams, and all relevant organizations … and ensure that the safety and well-being of everyone involved remain the top priority.” ___ AP soccer:  https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/kevin-federline-book-britney-spears-accb5a36b62b3e746b094a1ee6d2911f","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-17","timeOfPublication":"14:07:35+00:00","title":"Kevin Federline’s Memoir Details Controversial Relationship With Britney Spears, Son’s Trauma, and Public Backlash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Federline has released a memoir titled 'You Thought You Knew' in 2025, detailing his complex relationship with Britney Spears, their marriage, divorce, and co-parenting of their two sons, Preston and Jayden.

two sons with  Britney Spears  long kept him from telling his story, and those same concerns are the reason he’s telling it now that they’re men. In a memoir to be released Tuesday, “You Thought You Knew,” Federline documents his difficult years as husband, ex-husband, and co-parent with  Spears, who wrote her own memoir  in 2023. Federline’s includes some salacious stories and some potentially disturbing details about her behavior that have already made headlines. “I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there,” Federline, 47, told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview, backed by palm trees in Hawaii, where he now lives with wife Victoria Prince and their two daughters. “That’s a very, very big part of this for me. And it’s really important that I share my story, so they don’t have to.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n He and Spears’ son Preston is now 20 and his brother Jayden is 19.

She said Federline has engaged in “constant gaslighting.”  “Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I’m the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.” She said, adding that “if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking.” She also addressed her relationship with her sons:  “I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys.

The strikes have  set off tensions in the region , particularly between Trump, Venezuela and Colombia, once one of the American government’s tightest allies in the Western Hemisphere. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Colombian government said its survivor “will be prosecuted according to the law” for alleged drug trafficking.

Buckingham Palace and the British government were under pressure Monday to formally strip  Prince Andrew  of his princely title and sumptuous home after new revelations about his relationship with convicted sex offender   Jeffrey Epstein . After discussions with his elder brother  King Charles III ,  Andrew agreed on Friday to stop using  titles including Duke of York. It was the latest effort to insulate the monarchy from years of  tawdry headlines  about Andrew’s  suspicious business deals,  inappropriate behavior and controversial friendships. But he still technically holds the title of duke, bestowed by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. And as the son of a monarch, he remains a prince. Andrew’s statement relinquishing some of his royal titles came after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted, and days before publication of a posthumous memoir by Epstein accuser  Virginia Roberts Giuffre , who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, urged the king to go further and “remove the title of prince, too. “He shouldn’t be able to call himself one,” Roberts told The Times of London newspaper. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Civil suit Andrew, 65, has long  denied Giuffre’s claims , but  stepped down from royal duties  after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations.  Many viewers saw an entitled prince who failed to show empathy for Epstein’s victims and offered unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the late sex offender. Andrew paid millions in  an out-of-court settlement  in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York.  While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n ‘Angry and aghast’ Some opposition politicians said Andrew should formally be stripped of his dukedom through an act of Parliament. Scottish National Party lawmaker Stephen Flynn said the government should use legislation to remove titles from both Andrew and  Peter Mandelson , a member of the House of Lords who was fired as British ambassador to Washington in September over his past friendship with Epstein. “The family of Virginia Giuffre, whose life was destroyed, are angry and aghast,” Flynn said. “The public across these isles are angry and aghast and they both deserve to know that some (members of Parliament) share their outrage.” The government said it supported the palace’s decision over Andrew’s titles but should not act unilaterally. Under the U.K.’s constitutional monarchy, the crown does not interfere in politics and politicians stay clear of issues related to the royal family. “Our thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, those who suffered and continue to suffer because of the abuse that they experienced at his hands, but these are matters for the royal family,” Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the BBC. Some also want Andrew evicted from Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he lives alongside his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who will no longer be known as the Duchess of York. Questions have been raised about how Andrew pays for the house, which he rents on a long lease from the Crown Estate, a portfolio of properties that is nominally owned, but not controlled, by the monarch. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Royals brace for more revelations The palace is bracing for more embarrassing revelations, just as the king prepares for  a state visit to the Vatican  this week where he is due to pray beside Pope Leo XIV.

In an extract published in advance, Giuffre says the prince acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright.” Giuffre also claims in the book that Andrew’s team tried “to hire internet trolls to hassle me.” She said that Andrew insisted the lawsuit settlement include a one-year gag order to prevent allegations from tarnishing the late queen’s Platinum Jubilee in 2022. Meanwhile, London’s Metropolitan Police force says it is “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking one of his police bodyguards to find out whether she had a criminal record."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/how-indigenous-knowledge-is-aiding-pakistans-fight-against-climate-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"05:27:09+00:00","title":"How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan, Indigenous knowledge—such as observing changes in weather, animal behavior, and using traditional signals like gunfire—is being used by shepherds to predict and warn of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), especially in the absence of reliable and trusted early warning systems.

2025-10-13T05:27:09+00:00\n\nTitle: How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia, a company owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology, under the highly exceptional Goods Availability Act.

intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"07:32:37Z","title":"Trump torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework (NZF) by at least 12 months after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on countries supporting a global carbon tax on shipping emissions.

of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos

study finds overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year\n\nA new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has tightened export controls on 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals—adding five new ones (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium) and expanding restrictions on seven previously listed metals—effective December 1, 2025.

2025-10-10T11:47:27+00:00\n\nTitle: China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/mexico-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-64-with-dozens-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"21:47:55+00:00","title":"Mexico flooding death toll rises to 64, with dozens still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Mexico, heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond caused severe flooding across five states, resulting in at least 64 deaths and 65 people still missing.

near future, officials say\n\nOfficials from Russia and the US have dashed expectations that the leaders of their respective countries, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, are slated to meet soon to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nTuesday’s announcement comes after President Trump  announced  he would meet with his Russian counterpart in Hungary “within two weeks or so”.\n\n“There are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” a senior White House official told Al Jazeera.\n\nMoscow also denied that a meeting was imminent, saying that preparations “could take time”.\n\n“No precise timeframe was initially set here,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “Preparation is needed, serious preparation.”\n\nHopes for a near-term summit have dimmed in recent days. Reports have suggested that the delay is the result of differing views on the conditions necessary for ending the conflict.\n\nOver the weekend, Russia sent a private communique to the US demanding control of all of Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to officials who spoke to the news agency Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nThat demand conflicts with the desire Trump articulated on Sunday to see the battle lines frozen where they currently stand.\n\nThen, on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, held a phone call ahead of a planned in-person preparatory meeting.\n\nBut the White House confirmed on Tuesday that meeting would also not take place.\n\n“Secretary Rubio and Minister Lavrov had a productive call. Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary,” a White House official told Al Jazeera in a statement.\n\nCNN cited a government source as saying that the US is concerned that Moscow is sticking to a “maximalist stance” regarding its conditions for a ceasefire.\n\nLavrov dismissed the report as “unscrupulous” but insisted that Moscow’s position has not changed since Trump and Putin held a  summit in Alaska two months ago .\n\n“Russia has not changed its position compared to the understandings that were reached during the Alaska summit,” Lavrov told reporters. He added that he had conveyed this directly to Rubio when the two spoke by phone.\n\nLavrov said that the location and timing of the next Trump-Putin summit — which Trump announced after a phone call with Putin on October 16 — mattered less than implementing what the two sides agreed to in Alaska.\n\nAt the  August summit , Putin said his country is committed to ending the war but argued that the conflict’s “primary causes” must be eliminated for a ceasefire to be long-lasting.\n\nMoscow’s list of “primary causes” has included demands for Ukraine to remain “neutral” and its military capabilities to be dismantled. It has also sought to retain occupied Ukrainian territory.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and numerous European leaders responded by accusing Moscow of dragging its feet in peace efforts while continuing to wage “violence and destruction” on its neighbour.\n\n“Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” said a joint statement by Zelenskyy and eight European leaders. “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”\n\nThe apparent summit delay poses another setback for Trump, who has promised to end the war quickly but failed to extract concrete concessions from Moscow.\n\nAfter months of wavering messages, Trump has most recently called for  freezing the current battle lines  as a starting point for negotiations.\n\nThat  position has been embraced  by both Zelenskyy and European leaders.\n\nHowever, Putin has rejected multiple calls for a ceasefire and stuck to a list of hardline demands, including major territorial concessions, that Kyiv sees as unacceptable.\n\nUkraine says a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is needed to make progress, but the Kremlin has ruled out talks with the Ukrainian leader until a peace deal is practically agreed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused significant damage across the Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and two missing persons due to flooding and landslides.

Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/dutch-privacy-watchdog-warns-voters-against-asking-ai-how-to-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:14:51+00:00","title":"Dutch privacy watchdog warns voters against asking AI how to vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch Data Protection Authority has issued a public warning against using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok to decide how to vote, stating that these models provide a highly distorted and polarized view of politics.

warns voters against asking AI how to vote\n\nThe Netherlands’s data protection watchdog has cautioned citizens against consulting with artificial intelligence on how to vote, warning that popular chatbots provide a “highly distorted and polarised view” of politics.\n\nThe Dutch Data Protection Authority said on Tuesday that an increasing number of voters were using AI to help decide who to vote for, despite the models offering “unreliable and clearly biased” advice.\n\nThe watchdog issued the warning as it released the results of tests conducted on four popular chatbots – ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Grok – in the run-up to parliamentary elections on October 29.\n\nThe research found that the chatbots more often recommended parties on the fringes of the political spectrum when asked to identify the three choices that best matched the policy preferences of 1,500 fictitious voter profiles.\n\nIn more than half of cases, the AI models identified the hard-right Party for Freedom (PVV) or left-wing Green Left-Labour Party as the top choice, the watchdog said.\n\nParties closer to the political middle ground – such as the right-leaning People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the centre-left Democrats 66 – were recommended much less often, according to the watchdog.\n\nMeanwhile, some groupings, including the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal and left-leaning Denk, were “almost never suggested”.\n\nMonique Verdier, deputy chair of the authority, said that voters who turned to AI risked being encouraged to vote for parties that do not align with their preferences.\n\n“This directly impacts a cornerstone of democracy: the integrity of free and fair elections. We therefore urge voters not to use AI chatbots for voting advice because their operation is neither transparent nor verifiable,” Verdier said in a statement.\n\n“Additionally, we call on chatbot providers to prevent their systems from being used as voting guides.”\n\nThe October 29 election comes after the PVV, led by anti-immigration firebrand Geert Wilders, pulled its support for the government after its coalition partners refused to back a 10-point plan to radically curtail immigration.\n\nWilders’s PPV, which scored one of the biggest upsets in Dutch political history by winning the most seats in the 2023 election, has consistently led opinion polls before next week’s vote.\n\nWhile the PPV is on track to win the most seats for a second straight election, it is all but certain to fall far short of a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe other major parties in the Netherlands, which has been governed by coalition governments without interruption since the 1940s, have all ruled out supporting the PPV in power."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/drone-attack-in-sudan-threatens-khartoum-airports-reopening-reports","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:29:03+00:00","title":"Drone attack in Sudan threatens Khartoum airport’s reopening: Reports","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A series of drone attacks, including suicide drones, targeted Khartoum international airport and surrounding areas in Sudan just one day before its long-awaited reopening.

However, experts say his claims are not based on rigorous and robust research.\n\n“There’s two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism, and it’s highly likely because they’re given  Tylenol ,” said Kennedy, who, like President Donald Trump, cited shaky research about the drug and autism when warning  pregnant  women against taking the acetaminophen.\n\nCircumcision is the removal of penis foreskin, a typically elective procedure performed on infants largely for religious and cultural reasons.\n\nWe looked at the studies, one from 2013 and another from 2015.\n\nNeither showed that circumcision causes autism. Neither had data on whether acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, was given to the patients in the studies.\n\nThe two papers found some association between circumcision and autism, but both had significant limitations, including small sample sizes.\n\nAuthors of both papers advised further research to confirm a relationship.\n\nDecades of research show that acetaminophen is safe for infants and children when used as recommended and under a paediatrician’s guidance. No research shows that taking the drug as a child causes increased autism risk.\n\nAcetaminophen is not universally recommended for circumcisions. Infant circumcision is typically performed with a local anaesthetic. Some hospital guidelines advise parents to give infants acetaminophen as needed for pain in the days following the procedure.\n\nAsked about Kennedy’s statements on circumcision, a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson pointed us to the secretary’s October 10 post on X in which he pointed to the 2015 study and an unpublished research paper from 2025.\n\nAs usual, the mainstream media attacks me for something I didn’t say in order to distract from the truth of what I did say.\n\nAt yesterday’s Cabinet meeting, I said: “There are two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism, and it’s highly…\n\n— Secretary Kennedy (@SecKennedy)  October 10, 2025\n\nThe 2025 paper Kennedy referenced in his X post has not been peer-reviewed. It is considered a preprint, which means it has not been vetted by other scientific experts in the field, a standard process for scholarly research that aims to ensure its quality and rigour prior to publication.\n\nThe paper was authored by researchers at WPLab, a North Carolina company that promotes a link between  acetaminophen  and autism. In September, The Atlantic reported that WPLab CEO William Parker, a retired Duke University associate professor, has been in frequent contact with Kennedy.\n\nThe WPLab paper starts by saying in its abstract that “overwhelming evidence” shows acetaminophen exposure in babies “triggers many if not most cases of autism spectrum disorder”. The company makes similar statements about causation in several other papers, but that view does not reflect scientific consensus.\n\nThe premise of the article posted this summer is that “evidence that acetaminophen triggers autism” has been “ignored and mishandled” in existing published research. It is a critique and analysis; it does not represent any new scientific research. It points to the 2013 and 2015 studies about circumcision and autism, but misrepresents the scope of the 2015 study’s findings. It does not explain that the 2013 study was a basic population-level look at circumcision rates and autism rates.\n\nAuthored by UMass-Lowell epidemiologists, the 2013 peer-reviewed study aimed to see if there was an association (not causation) between giving young infants acetaminophen and developing autism. The study was described by the authors as a “hypothesis generating exploratory analysis”, meaning it was not intended to reach a conclusion about a link.\n\nCircumcision was not the focus. Data about the procedure was analysed as if it were a proxy for giving Tylenol to a baby. But the study did not confirm whether the drug was given in the cases it cited.\n\nThe study looked at nine countries. For each country, it collected two pieces of data: the percentage of the population that was circumcised and its prevalence of autism in men. In some cases, the circumcision rate was estimated based on the number of Jewish and Muslim men in a country.\n\nIt used those few pieces of data to calculate a correlation.\n\n“You can’t really do a correlation with any level of legitimacy from a statistical point of view on such a small sample size,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, professor emerita at Boston University and founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists.\n\nThe study said there was a positive association between a population’s circumcision rates and its autism rates, but cautioned there were “significant limitations” to the study and that “correlation is not causation and as such no causal inference is intended”. The authors called for more research to “confirm or disprove this association”.\n\nDespite having no data on whether kids represented in the data were given acetaminophen, the study linked the finding to the drug’s use by looking at data from before 1995, around the time when acetaminophen became a tested treatment for circumcision-related pain. The study found a slightly weaker correlation pre-1995.\n\nThe 2015 Danish study explored whether being circumcised meant a boy was more likely to be diagnosed with autism before age 10. The study did not examine acetaminophen use.\n\nThe study found that the risk of autism was 46 to 62 percent increased in boys who were circumcised, but this finding needs a lot of context.\n\nFirst, circumcision in Denmark is rare and happens mostly among Jewish and Muslim families. But the study had only circumcision data from hospitals and doctors’ offices, meaning it did not count procedures that happened in home religious ceremonies.\n\nAdditionally, because circumcision and autism diagnoses are both uncommon, those groups’ sample sizes were small. In a study of 342,877 boys born between 1994 and 2003, fewer than 1 percent (3,347 boys) were circumcised, and about 1.5 percent (5,033 boys) had autism. Just 57 boys had both.\n\n“We’re talking about a relatively small number of children out of this very large Danish population,” Tager-Flusberg said. When the study broke the samples down by faith groups or eliminated incomplete data from the analysis, its findings were more dramatic but based on even smaller numbers. The finding of a 62 percent increased risk of autism was based on just 24 boys. Other researchers in the field publicly criticised the study for issues with its methods.\n\nIn 2019, one of the study’s authors, Morten Frisch, proposed that the Danish Parliament should prohibit circumcision until the age of 18.\n\nAlthough the 2015 study did not look at acetaminophen use, the WPLab paper cited it as “some of the most compelling ‘standalone’ evidence that acetaminophen triggers autism in susceptible babies and children” – a statement Kennedy quoted from in his X post.\n\n“Neither of these studies take into consideration a whole range of potential cultural demographic or other confounding variables that one must always be aware of when looking at associations between some sort of risk factor and autism,” Tager-Flusberg said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/general-strike-shuts-down-tunisias-gabes-over-pollution-crisis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:41:26+00:00","title":"General strike shuts down Tunisia’s Gabes over pollution crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, a general strike and mass protests erupted in Gabes, Tunisia, as residents demand the shutdown of the state-run CGT phosphate plant, which they blame for decades of environmental and health crises, including respiratory illness, cancer, and the collapse of marine life.

territory.\n\n“Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East, have explicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and ‘straighten our Hamas’ if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.\n\nTrump did not specify which countries offered to go into Gaza, but he did single out Indonesia for its assistance in the region.\n\n“I would like to thank the great and powerful country of Indonesia, and its wonderful leader, for all of the help they have shown and given to the Middle East, and to the USA,” Trump said.\n\nJakarta and other governments have offered to send peacekeeping troops to restore security and  stability in Gaza , but no country has said that it would be willing to clash directly with Hamas.\n\n“The love and spirit for the Middle East has not been seen like this in a thousand years! It is a beautiful thing to behold! I told these countries, and Israel, ‘NOT YET!’ There is still hope that Hamas will do what is right,” the US president said.\n\n“If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL!”\n\nIsrael has killed nearly 100 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect on October 10.\n\nTrump often issues similar threats to Hamas. But it is not clear what the US or any other force can do to strong-arm the Palestinian group that Israel has not.\n\nOver the past two years, Israel has killed most of Hamas’s political and military leaders, while also killing more than 68,000 other Palestinians, levelling Gaza to the ground, and imposing famine on the territory in a campaign that leading rights groups and  United Nations investigators  say is a genocide.\n\nTrump had been hailing the ceasefire, which his administration helped broker, as a historic turning point to bring peace to the region.\n\nBut from the outset of the truce, Israel has been killing Palestinians it claims were approaching areas under control of the Israeli military, which are not clearly marked.\n\nMoreover, Israel has continued to restrict aid to Gaza despite commitments in the deal to allow a surge in humanitarian assistance to the territory.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel has only allowed the entry of 986 aid trucks into the enclave since the start of the ceasefire, a fraction of the expected 6,600 trucks, at a rate of 600 daily.\n\nOn Sunday, the agreement was pushed to the brink when Israel  launched a wave  of air strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians and fully suspended the entry of aid to Gaza after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah.\n\nIsrael blamed Hamas for killing the troops, but the Palestinian group denied any involvement, underscoring that the incident took place in an area under Israeli control.\n\nSome US media outlets  reported  that the Israeli soldiers were killed after they drove over an unexploded ordnance.\n\nBesides the day-to-day issues threatening the truce, question marks continue to hang over the long-term future of Gaza, including how the territory will be governed.\n\nTrump has stressed that Hamas  must disarm , but the Palestinian group has linked giving up its weapons to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump told Fox News that there is no hard timeline for Hamas disarmament.\n\nLater that day, his vice president, JD Vance, who is currently visiting Israel, suggested that an international force needs to deploy to Gaza and establish “security infrastructure” before Hamas disarms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Israel later on Tuesday, Vance expressed optimism about the future of the ceasefire, saying that the bursts of violence were not unexpected.\n\n“We are doing very well. We’re in a very good place. We’re going to have to keep working on it, but I think we have the team to do exactly that,” he said.\n\nVance reiterated that Hamas must disarm, but he acknowledged that the process will take time.\n\nAsked about efforts to return the bodies of slain Israeli captives, an issue that Israel has cited to justify blocking aid to Gaza, the US vice president highlighted the difficulty in reaching the remains amid the widespread destruction.\n\n“This is not going to happen overnight,” he said. “Some of the hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages no one even knows where they are.”\n\nWhile the bodies of around 15 Israelis remain in Gaza, thousands of Palestinians have gone missing throughout the war, many presumed dead and buried under the rubble.\n\nIsrael has returned the bodies of at least 135 Palestinian captives to Gaza, with many showing  signs of torture  and execution, according to health officials in the territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance announced the opening of the Civilian Military Co-operation Centre (CMCC), a US-led base in Israel that will facilitate reconstruction and aid delivery to Gaza.\n\nBrad Cooper, the commander of the Middle East-based Central Command of the US military, said there are 200 American troops serving at the centre.\n\n“This facility will be the hub for the delivery of everything that goes into Gaza as we look to the future,” he told reporters.\n\nThe US military had said that American soldiers would not be on the ground inside Gaza."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/lawyers-urge-us-appeals-court-to-uphold-mahmoud-khalids-release-order","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:22:08+00:00","title":"Lawyers urge US appeals court to uphold Mahmoud Khalil’s release order","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian solidarity activist and legal permanent resident, was detained in March 2025 at Columbia University over his advocacy, leading to a habeas corpus petition that resulted in his release in June 2025.

2025-10-21T19:22:08+00:00\n\nTitle: Lawyers urge US appeals court to uphold Mahmoud Khalil’s release order\n\nLawyers for Mahmoud Khalil have asked appeals judges in the United States to keep in place a  lower court’s order  that freed the Palestine solidarity activist from immigration detention.\n\nKhalil – whom the US government is trying to deport over his activism at  Columbia University  last year – told supporters outside the courtroom in Philadelphia after the hearing on Tuesday that his case is proving to be a “test for everyone’s rights”.\n\nHe suggested that there “is no immediate risk” of his being re-detained.\n\n“Nothing should deter anyone from speaking out for the liberation of Palestine, for the rights of immigrants everywhere,” Khalil  said .\n\nGovernment lawyers are trying to get a three-judge panel on the court of appeals to reverse the decision to free him, arguing that the federal district court in New Jersey that granted his release lacked jurisdiction in the case.\n\nKhalil, who is a legal permanent resident, was the first prominent Palestinian rights advocate to be detained and have his immigration status challenged over campus activism.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has said that it targeted hundreds of students for deportation, accusing them of supporting “terrorism” and spreading anti-Semitism – accusations that the activists deny.\n\nTo legally justify the crackdown, the Trump administration has been invoking an immigration law provision that grants the secretary of state the power to deport non-citizens whose presence in the country has “adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US.\n\nBobby Hodgson, assistant legal director at the New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told reporters at a virtual briefing on Tuesday that the government’s assertion of broad deportation powers on foreign policy grounds is “wrong” and “unconstitutional”.\n\n“What our arguments really boil down to is that, in the United States, ideas are not illegal, and the government cannot weaponise a vague immigration law to incarcerate or remove people for expressing opinions with which they disagree,” said Hodgson.\n\nKhalil was arrested by immigration authorities in March and  missed the birth  of his first child while in a detention centre in Louisiana.\n\nThe court decision to release Khalil in June did not conclude his immigration case. It was related to a legal petition challenging his detention, known as habeas corpus.\n\nThe deportation case is proceeding through a separate process in the immigration system.\n\nThe US government has also accused Khalil of concealing his work for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) on his visa and Green Card applications to bolster the deportation case.\n\nLast month, an immigration judge sided with the government in  ordering the removal  of Khalil from the country.\n\nImmigration judges work within the executive branch and do not represent independent courts like the constitutional judicial system.\n\nKhalil’s immigration case is now being appealed to an administrative body called the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\nIf the board affirms the immigration judge’s ruling, the decision is likely to be appealed to a circuit court – part of the normal judicial system – on constitutional grounds.\n\nWith both the habeas corpus petition and the immigration case facing appeals from both sides, the legal saga is not likely to conclude any time soon.\n\nBut for now, Khalil and many others in  the same situation  remain free due to decisions by district courts.\n\nIn a separate, broader case, a US judge found last month that the Trump administration’s crackdown on Palestine solidarity activists was unlawful, as it aimed to silence criticism of Israel, violating constitutionally protected free speech rights.\n\n“We are not, and we must not become, a nation that imprisons and deports people because we are afraid of what they have to tell us,” Judge William Young wrote  in his ruling ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/how-russias-new-tactics-pose-new-winter-threat-to-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:20:23+00:00","title":"How Russia’s new tactics pose fresh winter threat to Ukraine","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia has launched a new, more sophisticated phase of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, targeting power stations like Kyiv’s Thermal Station 5 and natural gas delivery facilities with hundreds of modified drones and missiles.

destroyed a giant transformer at a key power station in the Ukrainian capital.\n\n“There’s nothing left to repair,” Mykola Svyrydenko, who lives close to Thermal Station 5, a sprawling, Soviet-era structure with two giant steam pipes that provides electricity and heat to hundreds of thousands of Kyiv’s residents, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe saw the predawn attack on October 10 that caused several blasts and a giant fire at the power station. The attack involved 465 drones and 32 missiles that targeted several Ukrainian cities, authorities said.\n\n“This isn’t the first time the station has been hit,” another local, Artyom Gavrilenko, told Al Jazeera outside his five-storey apartment building.\n\nSince the winter of 2022, Russia has tried to hit Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leaving the country scrambling to provide power to its homes and industries in subzero temperatures.\n\nAlthough it has survived those assaults, the recent attack on the Kyiv station represents a new phase in Russia’s campaign to ruin Ukrainian power, transmission and heating stations, as well as natural gas mines, pipelines and underground reservoirs. It is a shift in Russian tactics that could test Ukraine like never before, say analysts.\n\nOn October 10, Gavrilenko’s building – and most of the city of almost four million people – were left without power and running water for most of the day. Stinky petrol or diesel generators – some chained to walls or trees to prevent theft – buzzed next to shops, restaurants and private houses, while people exhausted their power banks.\n\nFor the first time since Russia began its full-scale invasion, one of Kyiv’s subway lines stopped operating for several hours, paralysing traffic on the bridges between the left and right banks of the Dnipro River that bisects the city. Russia began to attack natural gas delivery facilities deliberately, Energy Minister Mykola Kolesnik told a news conference on Monday.\n\n“The enemy won’t stop, he confirmed it – only in early October, we’ve seen more than six strikes [on natural gas delivery facilities], and they will go on,” he said, announcing plans to boost the import of natural gas from Europe.\n\n“What we see is the change of enemy’s strategy that results in the regional deficits of power generation and transmission,” he said.\n\nThe strikes aim to leave millions of civilians defenceless against the upcoming winter chill as weather reports forecast an unusually cold winter with plenty of snow.\n\nMoscow uses hundreds of drones for each attack, and most of them have been modified to fly faster, at higher altitudes, and dive on their targets at sharp angles to avoid being downed or intercepted.\n\nRussia also modified its missiles through software updates to veer off predictable courses and confuse advanced Western-supplied air defence systems, including US-made Patriots.\n\nThe modifications changed the rate of missile interception dramatically from 37 percent in August to 6 percent in September, according to an analysis by the Centre for Information Resilience, a London-based group.\n\nThe results have been devastating.\n\nOn August 28, Russian missiles damaged a nearly completed factory in eastern Kyiv meant to produce Turkish-designed Bayraktar drones. Two more missiles hit a nearby apartment building, slicing off two of its five floors, killing 22 civilians, including four children, and wounding dozens.\n\n“I woke up and automatically pulled the blanket over my head,” Anatoly, a 63-year-old retiree, told Al Jazeera hours later, explaining how the blanket he was under saved his face from dagger-like glass shards.\n\nHe was speaking while puffing on cigarette after cigarette, standing next to a crew of rescue workers and what remained of his possessions – a dishwasher, a couple of shelves and a bundle of clothes.\n\nThe problem has been exacerbated by corruption.\n\nIn early August, Ukraine’s anticorruption agencies unveiled a giant corruption scheme to inflate the costs of anti-drone installations by up to 30 percent.\n\nA lawmaker, city officials and National Guard servicemen were involved in the scheme, and four unidentified suspects were arrested, the agencies said.\n\n“There must be full and fair accountability for this,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address.\n\nThe corruption case underscored Ukraine’s failures to protect energy infrastructure that has been pummelled since October 2022, said analysts.\n\n“Instead of putting [the infrastructure] underground within the three years, they placed sandbags around it and stole funds on meaningless, but imposing ‘drone interceptors’,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University who penned hundreds of detailed reports on the hostilities, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs a result, the energy infrastructure is now close to collapsing.\n\n“We’ll have a very harsh winter ahead of us,” an engineer at a state-run company that oversees the restoration of power stations and transmission lines told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe spoke on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to talk to the media.\n\n“Judging by the degree of destruction, we’ll hardly be able to repair what is being destroyed,” the engineer added.\n\nResidents of Kyiv, meanwhile, are preparing for power and heat shortages, buying canisters of petrol, power banks, battery-powered electric blankets, rechargeable lamps of all kinds, or unfolding Christmas garlands — which shine, offering some light during blackouts — well before the holiday season.\n\nMany are even snubbing fire prevention regulations by installing wood stoves in their apartments.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin “will not catch us by surprise the way he did three years ago”, Olena Korotych, a mother of two, told Al Jazeera outside a supermarket, where she was buying torches.\n\nAt filling stations, employees nod understandingly when helping fill canisters – something that is banned in many countries.\n\nA bus stop away from Thermal Power Station 5, Arslan Atamuradov, a migrant from Tajikistan, now uses such natural gas canisters to power the glistening grill at his shawarma kiosk, instead of the electricity he once relied on.\n\n“We run everything on [natural] gas,” Atamuradov said. “Otherwise, our expenses double.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/us-and-belize-sign-safe-third-country-agreement-for-asylum-seekers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:35:34+00:00","title":"US and Belize sign ‘safe third country’ agreement for asylum seekers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and Belize have signed a 'safe third country' agreement allowing asylum seekers to be transferred to Belize, a move aligned with the Trump administration’s broader policy of limiting asylum applications and increasing deportations.

third country’ agreement for asylum seekers\n\nThe United States and Belize have signed a “safe third country” immigration agreement, which will allow the administration of President Donald Trump to transfer asylum seekers to the Central American country.\n\nThe deal marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to limit asylum applications in the US and carry out a campaign of mass deportation.\n\nThe two countries signed the agreement on Monday, with Belize calling it an act “ grounded in the commitment  of states to cooperate under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees”.\n\nIn a  statement  posted on Facebook, its government press office wrote, “The Agreement reinforces Belize’s commitment to international law and humanitarian principles while ensuring strong national safeguards.”\n\nThe US State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, meanwhile, thanked Belize in a post on X.\n\nThe deal, it said, was “ an important milestone  in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation’s asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together.”\n\n“Safe third country” agreements are a controversial tactic used to restrict asylum applications: They identify countries asylum seekers can be safely removed to, regardless of whether that is their intended destination.\n\nThe details of Monday’s agreement are as yet unclear. But the Central American country indicated it would receive US asylum seekers in exchange for “financial and technical assistance to enhance Belize’s asylum and border management policies”.\n\nSince Trump returned to office for a second term in January, his administration has repeatedly lobbied third-party countries to accept deportations, though few such deals have been termed “safe third country” accords.\n\nNearly a dozen countries — including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Mexico, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda — have since agreed to receive US deportees with no existing ties to their nations.\n\nJust this month,  Guatemala received its first deportation flight  from the US carrying third-country immigrants.\n\nHow safe some of those countries are has been a point of contention. Critics have pointed out that deportees could face abusive prison conditions or a lack of due process in countries like South Sudan, where the US State Department advises its citizens not to travel for fear of armed conflict.\n\nAlready, lawyers for five men deported to Eswatini have claimed they have been incarcerated and denied legal hearings.\n\n“Safe third country” agreements, by contrast, are specifically for asylum seekers, and they are meant to assure the rights and wellbeing of those involved.\n\nBut critics have long argued that they fail to fully guarantee the safety of asylum seekers, some of whom are removed to countries near the ones they fled, where they could still be vulnerable to persecution.\n\nSome human rights experts also believe “safe third country” agreements could be used to erode adherence to international humanitarian law, allowing wealthy countries like the US to shirk their legal responsibilities to asylum seekers.\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Belize sought to dispel any accusation that the Trump administration might be using the Central American nation as a “ dumping ground ” for migrants, as advocates in other third-party countries have alleged.\n\nBelize claimed it retained “an absolute veto over transfers, with restrictions on nationalities, a cap on transferees, and comprehensive security screenings”.\n\n“No person who is deemed to be a threat to the public safety or national security will be allowed to enter or stay in Belize,” it added.\n\nThe deal still needs approval from the Belize Senate.\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration has argued that deals with third-party countries are necessary in cases where migrants and asylum seekers are unable to return to their home countries.\n\nIn the case of asylum seekers, however, it would be a violation of US and international law to return them to countries where they might face persecution.\n\nStill, in other cases, the US has argued that the deportees’ home countries have refused to accept them.\n\nBut recent events have cast doubt on that rationale. In September, for instance, one man deported from the US to Eswatini was sent back to his home country of Jamaica.\n\nThis month’s deportation flight to Guatemala also saw Honduran passengers returned to their home country.\n\nSome countries, however, do have policies refusing to accept deportations from the US, even if those transfers involve their own citizens.\n\nVenezuela, for instance, has intermittently refused deportation flights from the US, though in March it reversed course and began accepting them.\n\nThe South American had protested the deportation of its citizens from the US to El Salvador, where more than  200 people  were sent to a maximum-security prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) that month.\n\nIn July , the Trump administration struck a deal that allowed the Venezuelans imprisoned in El Salvador to be returned to their home country, in exchange for the release of US citizens and political prisoners held in Venezuela.\n\nBut Venezuela-US relations have since soured once more, leaving the future of deportation flights to Caracas unclear.\n\nAs Belize faces the prospect of accepting asylum seekers who are unable to return to their home country, some politicians have already voiced strong opposition.\n\nTracy Taegar Panton, an opposition leader in Belize, questioned whether her country should even qualify as a “safe third country”.\n\n“To be designated a ‘Safe Third Country,’ Belize must demonstrate that it can guarantee human rights protections and provide a high standard of care including access to housing, healthcare, legal representation, and social services for asylum seekers,” she  wrote  on social media.\n\n“The reality, however, is stark. Our immigration and asylum systems are understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added that the agreement was beyond the country’s capacity to fulfil.\n\n“Belize cannot and must not be used as a dumping ground for individuals other countries refuse to accept,” she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/mona-lisa-to-the-nazis-robbed-often-why-latest-louvre-theft-is-different","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:14:05+00:00","title":"Mona Lisa to the Nazis: Robbed often, why latest Louvre theft is different","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris has faced repeated art thefts throughout history, beginning with the 1911 Mona Lisa heist by Vincenzo Peruggia, which significantly elevated the painting’s global fame.

different\n\nThe band of robbers who broke into the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning and stole  eight Napoleonic pieces  of priceless jewellery in a four-minute  heist  were just the latest in a long line of daring thieves who have targeted the iconic museum.\n\nThe robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to reach the gilded Galerie d’Apollon (Apollo’s Gallery) on the second floor before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place at 9:30am (07:30 GMT), half an hour after the museum opened to visitors for the day. The robbers are still at large and the Louvre is currently closed.\n\nA ninth item they stole – the crown belonging to Empress Eugenie, Napoleon III’s wife – was recovered nearby after it was dropped by the group, the French Ministry of the Interior said.\n\nThe Louvre was a royal palace for more than two centuries. It opened as a public museum in 1793 during the French Revolution. The revolution had made totems of monarchical history especially vulnerable to looters, and the Louvre, besides giving everyday French people a glimpse of these precious items, sought to protect the legacy they represented, for future generations.\n\nThat did not completely stop thieves, however. Over time, there have been several attempts to steal valuable items from the Louvre – often successful.\n\nOn August 21, 1911, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen in what was deemed the “heist of the century”.\n\nAt the time, the Mona Lisa was one of Italian painter da Vinci’s lesser-known works and had been on display since 1797. Many now say it was the theft itself that propelled the painting to its modern fame. At the time, the painting was hanging on a wall in a room called the “Salon Carre”.\n\nThe heist was carried out by Vincenzo Peruggia, a 29-year-old Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre. He entered the museum completely unchallenged on the evening of August 20, clad in his old museum uniform.\n\nPeruggia hid in a storage closet overnight and, in the morning, when the museum was closed and almost empty, emerged from the closet. He simply removed the painting from the wall and wrapped it in a white sheet. As he made to leave the museum, he found the stairwell door to the courtyard locked. But instead of being suspicious, a Louvre plumber helped Peruggia to unlock the door, mistaking him for a colleague.\n\nMuseum security was rather less robust back then, and paintings would often be removed for maintenance or to be photographed. Hence, no one batted an eye at the absence of the da Vinci painting for more than a day.\n\nConcern over its absence was eventually raised by a visiting artist, who came to the Salon Carre to paint. When the Louvre guards could not find the painting, police were alerted. What followed was an extensive manhunt and media frenzy.\n\nThe police did not initially find many leads. Avant garde poet Guillaume Apollinaire was arrested and questioned due to his links to earlier thefts from the Louvre. Apollinaire, who was cleared of suspicion, pointed to his friend, a young Pablo Picasso, who was also questioned by the police.\n\nPicasso was cleared of suspicion in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but in a grand twist, it was revealed he had previously acquired Iberian statue heads which had been stolen from the Louvre. He returned these to the Louvre to avoid any further trouble.\n\nRumours and speculation mounted about the painting’s possible whereabouts, with many believing it was smuggled abroad. But, the whole time, the Mona Lisa was actually in Peruggia’s one-bedroom apartment in Paris.\n\nIt was finally recovered in 1913 when Peruggia attempted to sell it to a gallery in Italy. He believed the sale had been successful when an art dealer he was in touch with invited him to Italy for a potential sale to a gallery, and he took the painting with him. Instead of buying the painting, however, the gallery turned Peruggia in. He was arrested in his hotel room in Florence.\n\nThe Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre in 1914, and Peruggia was charged with the theft. He said he had been motivated by national pride to steal the painting, claiming the painting had been looted from Italy. The painting was actually completed in France by Da Vinci and sold to the French royal family.\n\nIn 1940, the Nazis invaded France amid World War II and appeared poised to loot a section of the Louvre.\n\nHowever, as a preemptive move, Jacques Jaujard, the director of France’s national museums, ordered more than 1,800 cases containing Louvre masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa, to be moved to the French countryside.\n\nThis prevented a large-scale cultural loss when the Nazis marched into a largely empty museum.\n\nHowever, the Nazis did steal many pieces of Jewish artwork while occupying France. Many of these have been returned to France, and the Louvre began displaying them in 2018 in an attempt to reunite the stolen pieces with their original owners.\n\nIn 1966, five pieces of antique, handmade jewellery were stolen from John F Kennedy International Airport in New York. The jewellery was en route back to Paris from the United States, having been loaned by the Louvre for a museum display in Richmond, Virginia. Detectives later recovered the jewellery in a grocery bag, and three men were arrested for receiving stolen property.\n\nIn 1990, Pierre Auguste Renoir’s Portrait of a Seated Woman was cut from its frame and stolen from the third floor of the Louvre. At the same time, the museum discovered that some small jewellery items were also missing – and may have been for some time. “The disappearance of these objects, which are not of great value and are often seen on the market, is certainly quite old,” the then-director of museums in France said, according to The New York Times. It is unclear whether these items were ever recovered.\n\nThis week’s jewellery heist is distinctive because previous high-profile robberies in the Louvre have largely been of paintings.\n\n“A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,” American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera. Paintings have a non-intrinsic value, which is value assigned to them due to their cultural significance, he explained.\n\n“A painting doesn’t have a high intrinsic value because it’s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant.\n\n“With jewels, the cultural heritage value, which provides the majority of its value, is not something that the thieves are likely to take into consideration,” Charney added.\n\nYes. Collections of jewels can be broken down, recut and sold in a way that does not link them to the intact stolen items, making them almost impossible to trace — yet very valuable.\n\nThey do not even need to be on the black market if the jewels are recut significantly enough that they are not identifiable.\n\n“The only hope that police have, and we understand this from how past cases have played out, is if they offer a reward for the recovery of all the jewels intact that is higher than the value of the component parts of the jewellery,” Charney said.\n\nSuch a move might buy the police a bit more time to track down the items and catch those responsible as the thieves ponder their next move.\n\n“Otherwise, I’m afraid there’s not much hope that these will be recovered and they would likely have been cut down within hours of the theft,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/wfp-says-food-supplies-to-gaza-below-targets-urges-more-crossings-to-open","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"14:31:10+00:00","title":"WFP says food supplies to Gaza below targets, urges more crossings to open","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UN World Food Programme reports that daily food deliveries to Gaza are critically insufficient, with only 750 tonnes reaching the territory—far below the target of 2,000 tonnes—due to only two of the Israeli-controlled crossings being open.

Programme says that supplies to Gaza have ramped up after the US-brokered ceasefire, but are  still far short of its daily target  of 2,000 tonnes because only two crossings into the Palestinian territory are open.\n\nApproximately 750 metric tonens of food are now entering the Gaza Strip daily, according to the WFP, but this was still well below the scale of needs after two years of Israel’s devastating war that has reduced much of Gaza to ruins.\n\n“To be able to get to this scale-up, we have to use every border crossing point right now,” WFP spokesperson Abeer Etefa told a Geneva news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nShe said  only two of the Israeli-controlled crossings  into Gaza were operational – the Karem Abu Salem in the south and al-Karara in the centre (called Kerem Shalom and Kissufim in Israel, respectively).\n\nEtefa said that sustaining the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump was “vital; really it’s the only way we can save lives and push back on the famine in the north of Gaza.”\n\nThe US president’s 20-point plan for ending the war envisages “full aid” being sent into Gaza. An Israeli security official told Reuters that humanitarian aid continues to enter through the Karem Abu Salem crossing and additional crossings in accordance with the plan, without naming them.\n\nThe spokesperson said the UN agency now had 26 food distribution points open in Gaza – up from five on Friday, but still far short of the 145 it hopes to run throughout the territory. Most are in the south and centre of the Strip.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would remain closed until further notice, with its reopening dependent on Hamas handing over the bodies of deceased captives.\n\nHamas on Tuesday said it would hand over the remains of two more Israeli captives. The Qassam Brigades said it “will hand over the bodies of two Israeli prisoners that were exhumed today in the Gaza Strip at 9pm Gaza time (18:00 GMT).”\n\nThe group has so far handed over 13 of the 28 captives’ bodies it had pledged to return under the deal.\n\nSome nutrition supplies for children and pregnant women have reached northern Gaza via the south, Etefa said, but far short of the level required.\n\n“We haven’t had large-scale convoys into Gaza City or to the north of Gaza,” she said, adding that the WFP had not been granted permission to use the main north-south Salah al-Din Street.\n\nFood supplies delivered so far are enough to feed about half a million people for two weeks, she said. Many Palestinians in Gaza were storing the food they are receiving because they are afraid that supplies might again dry up.\n\n“They eat part of it, and they ration and keep some of the supplies for an emergency, because they are not very confident how long the ceasefire will last and what will happen next,” she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2101-10-21","timeOfPublication":"21:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of critical developments in science and technology, including a massive AWS cloud outage, rising AI risks like deepfake audio fraud, geopolitical tensions over semiconductor access between the US and China, and significant scientific milestones such as the Nobel Prize awarded to chemist Omar M.

Jazeera, in partnership with the Hind Rajab Foundation, has revealed new evidence in the killing of five-year-old Hind Rajab, her family, and the rescue team that tried to reach them in Gaza City.\n\nThe documentary,  Ma Khafiya Aatham  (Tip of the Iceberg), which aired on Monday, discloses previously unknown details about the killing of the Rajab family and others in the final days of January 2024.\n\nHind Rajab’s final hours – as  she pleaded for help  following the initial shelling that killed her uncle, aunt and three cousins in their car – were widely circulated on social media after the attack.\n\nDefending its actions that day, the Israeli government initially claimed that none of its forces was present when the Rajab family was killed, later asserting that the 335 bullet holes found in the family’s car were the result of an exchange of fire between Israeli troops and armed Palestinian fighters.\n\nHowever, a subsequent investigation of satellite imagery and audio from that day by the multidisciplinary research group  Forensic Architecture , based at Goldsmiths, the University of London, identified only the presence of several Israeli Merkava tanks in the vicinity of the Rajab family’s car and no evidence of any exchange of fire.\n\nThe overall commander of the tanks present during the family’s killing was Colonel Beni Aharon of Israel’s 401 Armoured Brigade. Colonel Aharon is already the subject of a criminal complaint at the International Criminal Court (ICC) filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation, which uses social media footage captured by Israeli soldiers during operations in Gaza as the basis for war crimes prosecutions.\n\nInvestigations by the foundation have identified that, within the 401st Brigade, the company known as “Vampire Empire”, under the command of Major Sean Glass, was directly responsible for killing the Rajab family and subsequently tampering with the crime scene.\n\nThe Vampire Empire company – its English name suggesting a multinational composition – is part of the 52nd Armoured Battalion under the command of Colonel Daniel Ella, who the foundation alleges bears direct responsibility for the killings at the field level.\n\nOne of the company’s soldiers, dual Israeli-Argentine national Itay Choukirkov, is currently being sued under Argentinian law for his alleged role in the family’s murder.\n\nAccording to the documentary, the 52nd Armoured Battalion, nicknamed Ha-Bok’im (The Breachers), was among the first Israeli units to enter Gaza in October 2023 and has since been involved in some of the Israeli army’s most lethal operations, including the destruction of several hospitals.\n\n“The government of Israel does not like these campaigns financed by organisations supporting the Palestinians,” Israeli security expert Yossi Melman told Al Jazeera in the documentary.\n\n“Of course it worries them and gives Israel a bad name when some Israelis – especially military personnel – are prosecuted for war crimes in some parts of the world,” he said.\n\nMelman added that such prosecutions are of concern not only to the Israeli army but also to its intelligence agencies – the internal Shin Bet and the external Mossad.\n\nThe Hind Rajab Foundation is pursuing several legal actions against individual Israeli soldiers, including Shimon Zuckerman, a self-styled “war influencer” who filmed himself and other members of the 8129 Engineering Corps razing the village of Khuza’a near Khan Younis.\n\nThe foundation says Zuckerman’s social media posts provide clear evidence of the genocidal intent that led to the killing of the Rajab family."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has urged global action to strengthen early-warning systems for extreme weather, noting that nearly half of all countries lack adequate monitoring and forecasting capabilities.

millions – especially those in developing nations – vulnerable.\n\nAs it released a new report on Monday, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-to-know-about-trumps-plan-to-build-250m-white-house-ballroom","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:12:12+00:00","title":"What to know about Trump’s plan to build $250m White House ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has initiated the construction of a new $250 million ballroom in the White House’s East Wing, marking the first major structural change to the building since 1948.

East Wing as part of United States  President Donald Trump’ s plans to build a new ballroom in a space traditionally reserved for the first lady.\n\nThe construction, which started on Monday, is the first structural change to the complex since 1948, and the first under Trump, who has already redecorated the Oval Office in lavish gold furnishings.\n\nAccording to reporting by The Associated Press news agency, the project went ahead despite not being formally approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees such operations, which is currently closed due to a nationwide  government shutdown.\n\nTrump first announced the new addition to the White House in July and again confirmed it in a post on Monday on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nHere’s what to know about the ballroom plans:\n\nTrump, in his announcement on Monday, said the East Wing is being reconstructed to add a ballroom. The president had, in the past, complained about the White House lacking a space large enough to host fellow national leaders and other important guests, according to the AP. Such state dinners have typically been held on the White House lawns.\n\n“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump wrote on Monday, adding that the project was being funded entirely privately, and that it would not affect the main White House building itself – a point that some have viewed with scepticism due to the huge scale of the renovations.\n\n“For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!” the president added.\n\nThe two-storey structure of the East Wing was added first in 1902. It has, since 1977, under Rosalynn Carter, housed the offices of the first lady and her staff, as well as a visitor’s entrance for foreign dignitaries. It also includes a large theatre and the Graphics and Calligraphy Office, responsible for producing invitations for non-political events held at the mansion. The wing is built directly on top of the underground emergency bunker reserved for the president.\n\nTrump’s ballroom is estimated to cost $250m, according to the AP and other US media reports. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in an earlier statement in August, said it would cost approximately $200m.\n\nTrump has said the costs would be footed by himself and private donors, although those entities have not been disclosed.\n\nThe new ballroom will be approximately 90,000 square feet (8,360 square metres), and will have a seating capacity of about 650 guests, according to Leavitt. Reuters news agency reports the new room will be able to hold up to 999 people.\n\nCurrently, most White House events are held in the East Room, which seats approximately 200 people.\n\nLeavitt said in August that construction will be completed “long before” the end of Trump’s term in January 2029. Offices there will be temporarily relocated during what she called the “modernisation” process. Leavitt added that “nothing will be torn down”.\n\n“It will be beautiful,” Trump said earlier in July. “It won’t interfere with the current building. It won’t be – it will be near it, but not touching it. And pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favorite.”\n\nWashington-based McCrery Architects will lead the project, along with construction teams from Virginia-based Clark Construction. Engineering will be provided by AECOM, headquartered in Dallas.\n\nThe mansion has gone through  numerous structural changes  since it was first completed in 1800, as different presidents aimed to redesign it to their taste.\n\nSome of the more notable changes in the past century include:\n\nThe White House, including the East and West Wings, is about 55,000 square feet across six floors. Its 18-acre grounds include 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 28 fireplaces.\n\nIts construction started on October 13, 1792, under President George Washington, and lasted until November 1, 1800, under President John Adams. It was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban, who modelled it after Ireland’s parliament building, Leinster House.\n\nThe mansion was severely damaged by fire lit by British forces in 1814, during the War of 1812 between the US and Britain, but it was immediately renovated. Every US president since Adams has lived in the White House."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/slovak-court-sentences-pm-ficos-attacker-to-21-years-for-terror","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:30:46+00:00","title":"Slovak court sentences poet that shot PM to 21 years for ‘terror attack’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Slovak court has convicted 72-year-old poet Juraj Cintula of a 'terror attack' for shooting Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, 2024, during a government meeting.

of a “terror attack” and sentenced him to 21 years in prison.\n\nThe Specialised Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica convicted and sentenced 72-year-old Juraj Cintula on Tuesday, saying he had acted “with a motivation to stop a proper functioning of the government” in a “particularly serious” crime.\n\nCintula, a poet from Levice in western Slovakia,  shot Fico four times at close range  on May 15, 2024 as the premier left a government meeting in central Slovakia.\n\nHe later claimed he was driven by “moral despair”. Fico was left seriously wounded but returned to work two months later.\n\nThe shooting and subsequent trial have shaken the small NATO-member country.\n\nNow serving his fourth term as prime minister, Fico has  repeatedly accused  the liberal opposition and media of fuelling the assassination attempt, without presenting evidence.\n\nProsecutors originally charged Cintula with premeditated murder, but they later reclassified the shooting as a “terror attack”, citing his political motivation.\n\nCritics have said that since the shooting, the populist Fico has become increasingly divisive, accelerating his alignment of Slovakia’s foreign policy with Russia, increasing criticism of the European Union, and implementing authoritarian and hardline conservative policy.\n\n“It was worth it,” local media quoted Cintula as shouting as he left court earlier this month after giving his closing trial statement.\n\nAfter the shooting, Cintula had told police he wanted to protest against steps taken by Fico’s government, including the halting of military aid to war-ravaged Ukraine, according to a leaked video.\n\nHe claimed he had sought to hurt, but not kill, the prime minister.\n\nIn his final trial statement, a visibly emotional Cintula told the court he had been overcome with “moral despair”, accusing the prime minister of being “drunk with power” and making “irrational decisions that damage this country”.\n\nHe called his defence “a manifesto … for all those who feel that the arrogance of power, corruption and lies has no place in the country where our children will grow up”.\n\n“The premier … embodied years of accumulated frustration and despair,” Cintula said.\n\nCintula’s lawyer, Namir Alyasry, told reporters after the hearing that he would “most likely appeal” the verdict.\n\nThe prime minister was not present at the trial and did not immediately comment on the verdict.\n\nHe previously said he forgave the attacker, whom he described as merely a “messenger of evil and political hatred” developed by the “politically unsuccessful and frustrated opposition”.\n\nSince his return to office in 2023, Fico’s government has launched a crackdown on nonprofit organisations, cultural institutions and some media outlets it deems “hostile”,  prompting mass protests .\n\nFico has also angered the opposition by calling for an end to Slovakia’s support for Ukraine, criticising EU sanctions targeting Russia and saying he would not allow Ukraine to join NATO.\n\nLast month, the Slovak parliament  approved a constitutional amendment  to limit the rights of same-sex couples as part of a sweeping change that also states that national law takes precedence over EU law."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/ai-now-sounds-more-like-us-should-we-be-concerned","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"14:46:58+00:00","title":"AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, a sophisticated AI voice scam targeted Italian businessmen, with fraudsters using artificial intelligence to create deepfake calls that sounded like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, requesting $1 million to rescue kidnapped journalists.

2025-10-06T14:46:58+00:00\n\nTitle: AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?\n\nSeveral wealthy Italian businessmen received a surprising phone call earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major AWS outage began at 07:11 GMT due to a flawed technical update to DynamoDB’s API in AWS’s Virginia data center, which triggered a DNS failure and caused widespread disruption across 113 services.

caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/12/death-toll-from-mexico-flooding-rises-to-44-dozens-more-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-12","timeOfPublication":"19:18:26+00:00","title":"Death toll from Mexico flooding rises to 44, dozens more missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Severe flooding in central and southeastern Mexico, caused by heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, has resulted in at least 44 confirmed deaths and dozens missing.

saboteurs amid fears of Russian ‘hybrid warfare’\n\nAuthorities have arrested eight individuals across Poland on suspicion of espionage and sabotage.\n\nIn a brief statement on social media, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk  said  on Tuesday that the case is developing and that “further operational activities are ongoing” without providing further details.\n\nThe arrests come amid accusations that Russia is operating a network of spies and saboteurs across Europe.\n\nReferring to the prime minister’s post, the coordinator of Poland’s special services, Tomasz Siemoniak,  said  the arrested people are suspected of engaging in espionage and planning attacks.\n\nThey were arrested due to “conducting reconnaissance of military facilities and critical infrastructure, preparing resources for sabotage, and directly carrying out attacks”, he said.\n\nLater, the Polish National Prosecutor’s Office said they were arrested for planning to send packages containing explosives to intimidate the population and destabilise European Union countries supporting Ukraine.\n\nJacek Dobrzynski, spokesman for Poland’s Special Services, told reporters that three Ukrainian nationals were among the eight arrested and that they had allegedly “created a sort of network to transport explosives across Poland and Romania to Ukraine”.\n\n“A 21-year-old Ukrainian was arrested here in Poland near Warsaw. His two accomplices who went to Romania were arrested by the Romanian secret service in Bucharest,” he added.\n\nRomania’s intelligence agency SRI said authorities “have prevented new sabotage acts … by two Ukrainian citizens under direct coordination of some representatives of Russian secret services”.\n\nThe Romanian prosecution unit against organised crime, DIICOT, said the pair had left packages containing explosives at an international delivery company.\n\nPolish officials have previously said the country has been targeted for espionage and sabotage in a “hybrid war” waged by Russia to destabilise nations supporting Ukraine.\n\nDobrzynski said Poland has arrested 55 people over suspected sabotage and espionage over the past three years or so.\n\n“These people who acted to the detriment of Poland have all been charged under Article 130 of the penal code, which pertains to espionage and sabotage,” he told reporters.\n\nSeveral other European countries have accused Moscow of organising numerous such attacks since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMoscow denies the accusations, branding them the result of “Russophobia”.\n\nIn May last year, Polish authorities arrested three men for an arson attack. In September, Lithuanian prosecutors broke up a network that they said planned arson and explosive attacks in several EU states.\n\nThe same month, Latvia’s security service announced the detention of a man suspected of passing military intelligence to Russia, and  British police arrested three people  suspected of running sabotage and espionage operations for Russia.\n\nThe United Kingdom has also repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating sabotage and spy operations on its soil and beyond. The Kremlin has accused London of blaming Moscow for “anything bad that happens”.\n\nThis autumn,  drone incursions  have added to the European security concerns, with Belgium, Denmark and Germany among several countries reporting sightings.\n\nThe incursions provoked airport closures in  Germany  and  Denmark .\n\n“We are at the beginning of a hybrid war against Europe,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we are going to see more of it … We see the pattern, and it does not look good,” she added.\n\nTusk pledged to urgently  upgrade Poland’s air defences  after NATO forces shot down several drones over his country last month.\n\nThe EU, recognising the inefficiency of using multimillion-euro weapons to battle cheap drones, has reacted to the incursions with proposals to develop a “drone wall” on its eastern borders."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

Amazon deforestation? A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdgp6n45po","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:14:08.520+00:00","title":"AWS outage: Are we relying too much on US big tech?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The AWS outage in 2025 disrupted critical UK services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC, reigniting global concerns over over-reliance on US tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft.

outage on Monday made global headlines after  knocking some of the world's largest sites offline for hours.\n\nFor users, the impacts ranged from the serious -  such as not being able to access vital banking, government or work services - to the not-so-serious, such as fears of losing long built-up streaks on Duolingo.\n\nBut the outage has also reignited the debate around whether countries, including the UK, are over-dependent on a handful of US tech firms.\n\nShould we worry that an issue occurring at the heart of Amazon's cloud computing operations in Virginia badly affected UK firms and services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC - and what, if anything, can we do about it?\n\nAmazon has embedded itself within the very fabric of cloud-based computing, the infrastructure that underpins the delivery of the IT systems which are so much a part of all our lives.\n\nThe company and Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, have each cornered somewhere between 30 and 40% of the market in the UK and Europe, according to the UK markets regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nBut even that figure doesn't fully capture how significant they are.\n\nBecause even if a service itself is not hosted by one of these two giants - or the UK's third largest provider, Google - critical things it relies upon still might be.\n\n\"A cloud deployment is a complicated piece of infrastructure with many components, some invisible,\" said Prof James Davenport, Hebron and Medlock Professor of Information Technology at the University of Bath.\n\nBrent Ellis, principal analyst at market researcher Forrester, said the outage exposed what he called the \"nested dependency\" between popular digital platforms and the array of services providing the web's technical underpinnings.\n\nHe also said it underscored the risks inherent in that dependency.\n\n\"There's great appeal to using tech giants, but assuming they are too big to fail or inherently resilient is a mistake, with the evidence being the current outage and past ones,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a feature of a highly concentrated risk where even small service outages can ripple through the global economy.\"\n\nThose ripples are what millions of users felt on Monday.\n\nSo, if relying on a small number of US firms has its risks, why do so many companies do it?\n\nThe answer, experts say, is that inking contracts with household names such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google also has its upsides.\n\nIt means a company doesn't have to pay hefty costs to run its own servers, and can leverage the power of so-called hyperscalers to handle fluctuations in site traffic - as well as benefit from heightened cyber-security.\n\nVili Lehdonvirta, professor of technology policy at Aalto University in Finland, told the BBC that the sector, at its core, is \"driven by economies of scale.\"\n\nOr, put another way, reducing the current dependence on US tech giants and creating a more \"sovereign\" infrastructure would come with a high price tag.\n\nWith the likes of Amazon and Microsoft already embedded in many different aspects of digital operations, companies looking to migrate elsewhere or diversify may face challenges, said Stephen Kelly of Circata.\n\n\"The explosion of enterprise data now stored with a single provider like AWS makes the eventual cost of migrating to different vendors prohibitively high,\" he said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Thomas Hyslip, who currently teaches at University of South Florida,  said that there was another benefit to the dominance of US firms.\n\n\"Of all the places for it to be, I think it's best it's in the US because you don't have a lot of government interference,\" he said.\n\nStill, that concentration could invite government intervention, he added.\n\n\"If god forbid there was ever another war involving the US and some other countries, there could be the opportunity for the government to interject themselves and cause problems for whoever the enemy was at that point,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless there is unease about the status quo.\n\nThe dominance of a few small companies has come to define much of the tech industry at large - from social media to streaming\n\nAnd in the cloud sector, some believe this may mean smaller providers can be overlooked or ignored.\n\nNicky Stewart, senior advisor to the Open Cloud Coalition, has joined lots of other experts in saying Monday's outage showed \"the risks of over-reliance on two dominant cloud providers, an outage most of us will have felt in some way\".\n\nThe CMA  said in July  its investigation into competition in the UK cloud services market had found it was \"not working well\".\n\nThe regulator recommended it use its own recently-acquired powers to investigate whether to designate Amazon and Microsoft as having \"strategic market status\" - which would allow it to demand changes to boost competition.\n\nMs Stewart said events like the AWS outage demonstrate the need for \"a more open, competitive and interoperable cloud market; one where no single provider can bring so much of our digital world to a standstill\".\n\n\"Fair and open competition will enable the UK to diversify its cloud workloads, strengthen our national resilience and allow UK challenger cloud providers to bring their talent and innovation to this over-concentrated and unhealthy market,\" she said.\n\nMr Kelly, meanwhile, said the potential \"difficulty\" of diversifying cloud providers should not overshadow the urgent need for IT resilience.\n\nUltimately, he said, the solution was political.\n\n\"The UK government should also take the lead in mandating data resilience standards across key industries, including policy frameworks that require the use of two or more distinct cloud providers and promote continuous data replication,\" he said.\n\nLord Leong, speaking on behalf of the government in the House of Lords on Tuesday, said it was in contact with AWS about how it would mitigate outages in future.\n\n\"We are working to diversify the UK's cloud ecosystem and encourage greater participation by UK-based and European providers,\" he told peers.\n\nSign up for our Tech

Trump to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin \"in the immediate future\", a White House official has stated.\n\nLast Thursday Trump said he and the Russian president would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks to discuss the war in Ukraine.\n\nA preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a \"productive\" call and that a meeting was no longer \"necessary\".\n\nThe White House did not share any more details on why the talks had been put on hold.\n\nBut key differences between US proposals and Russia's preconditions for peace became increasingly clear this week, and appear to have dashed chances of a summit between the two presidents.\n\nTrump had discussed a Budapest summit over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House.\n\nSome reports suggested his talks with Zelensky had been a \"shouting match\", with sources suggesting Trump had pushed him to give up large areas of territory in eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.\n\nHowever, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.\n\nOn Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.\n\n\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"\n\nRussia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.\n\nMoscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.\n\nThe \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, European leaders put out a statement with Zelensky saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being \"serious\" about peace.\n\nTrump and Putin last met in Alaska in August during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.\n\nThe White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may have been an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.\n\n\"I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,\" a senior European diplomat told Reuters.\n\nZelensky said discussions about the front line were the \"beginning of diplomacy\"  which Russia was doing everything to avoid.\n\nThe only topic that could make Moscow \"pay attention\" was the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine, he added.\n\nPutin's unscheduled call with Trump last Thursday came following speculation that the US was preparing to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv that could potentially strike deep into Russia.\n\nZelensky said it was the Tomahawks issue that had forced Russia to engage in discussion. The talk about the missiles had turned out to be a \"strong investment in diplomacy\", he added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9k2dj37wqo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:09:21.991+00:00","title":"Gaza ceasefire deal going better than expected, Vance says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US Vice President JD Vance reports that the Gaza ceasefire agreement is progressing better than expected, despite recent violence and tensions.

Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"\n\nThe Israeli military blamed Hamas for an anti-tank missile attack on Sunday that killed two Israeli soldiers in southern Gaza and then carried out dozens of strikes across the territory which hospitals said killed at least 45 Palestinians.\n\nAfterwards, the Israeli military said it was resuming enforcement of the ceasefire, while Hamas said it remained committed to the agreement.\n\nHowever, four Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire east of Gaza City on Monday. The Israeli military said its troops fired towards \" terrorists\" who crossed the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates the area still occupied by Israeli forces.\n\nHamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, who is in Cairo, meanwhile insisted that his group and other Palestinian factions were committed to the ceasefire deal and \"determined to fully implement it until the end\".\n\n\"What we heard from the mediators and the US president reassures us that the war in Gaza is over,\" he told Egypt's Al-Qahera News TV .\n\nHayya also said Hamas was serious about handing over the bodies of all the deceased hostages still in Gaza despite facing what he described as \"extreme difficulty\" in its efforts to recover them under rubble because of a lack of specialist equipment.\n\nOvernight, Israeli authorities confirmed that Hamas had handed over the body of another deceased Israeli hostage to the Red Cross in Gaza.\n\nThe remains were identified as those of Tal Haimi, 41, who the Israeli military said was killed in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, which triggered the war.\n\nThat means 13 of the 28 hostages' bodies held in Gaza when the ceasefire took effect on 10 October have so far been returned.\n\nTwenty living Israeli hostages were also released last week in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.\n\nThere has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the dead hostages, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying that the group \"was required to uphold its commitments\".\n\nMeanwhile, the UN's World Food Programme stressed that sustaining the ceasefire was \"vital\" to delivering life-saving humanitarian aid to the territory.\n\nSince the ceasefire took effect, 530 WFP lorries have crossed into Gaza with more than 6,700 tonnes of food. This was enough to feed almost 500,000 people for two weeks, spokeswoman Abeer Atefa told a briefing in Geneva.\n\nHowever, she said the agency could not reach its daily target of 2,000 tonnes of supplies because not all the crossings into the territory were open.\n\nOnly two crossings - Kerem Shalom and Kissufim - were functional with neither of them located in the north, where the food situation remained \"extremely dire\", she added.\n\nSome specialised nutritional supplements for children and pregnant women have been distributed in the north via the south, but no large-scale deliveries have been possible.\n\nMs Atefa said that in the south of the territory, where people were now able to access food safely and with dignity, there had been no looting of WFP supplies.\n\nBut she added that many people were often eating just a small portion of their supplies and rationing the rest because they were highly anxious about the future and feared that deliveries could be blocked again.\n\nIsrael, which controls the entry of aid into Gaza, temporarily halted deliveries in response to Sunday's violence. Deliveries resumed on Monday following heavy international pressure.\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.\n\nAt least 68,216 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891yxgj44ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:39:18.637+00:00","title":"Who is paying for Donald Trump's new White House ballroom?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The construction of President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom has sparked ethical controversy, with questions over whether corporate donors—such as Blackstone, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others—are funding the project in exchange for access to the administration.

Donald Trump's new White House ballroom? \n\nAs construction begins on President Donald Trump's new, $250m (£187m) White House ballroom, mystery continues to swirl around the identities of the wealthy donors and corporations paying for it.\n\nGroundbreaking for the ornate 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) project began on Monday, with excavators and construction workers tearing out portions of the East Wing.\n\nThe US president has said that he personally will pay for significant portions of its construction, and suggested that some still anonymous donors would be willing to spend more than $20m to complete the project.\n\nThe funding model has sparked concern among some legal experts, who say it may amount to paying for access to the administration.\n\n\"I view this enormous ballroom as an ethics nightmare,\" Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House between 2005 and 2007, told the BBC.\n\n\"It's using access to the White House to raise money. I don't like it,\" he added. \"These corporations all want something from the government.\"\n\nA dinner for potential donors held at the White House on 15 October included senior executives from prominent American companies including Blackstone, OpenAI, Microsoft, Coinbase, Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\n\nAlso present was Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets NFL team, and Shari and Edward Glazer, who, together with their siblings, own both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United.\n\nA pledge form reviewed by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, suggested that donors could be eligible for \"recognition\" for their contributions. While plans are still being finalised, that recognition could potentially take the form of names etched into the structure.\n\nThe White House had originally said that the gigantic structure would have a seated capacity of 650 people. This week, Trump said that it will be able to hold 999.\n\nOnly one contributor has so far been revealed.\n\nCourt documents show that YouTube will pay $22m towards the project as part of a settlement with Trump regarding a lawsuit over the suspension of his account following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how many of the rest of those in attendance have pledged to donate, or how much. An official list has yet to be published, although White House officials say they plan to reveal the one.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS indicate that the donations will be handled by the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit that works with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.\n\nAt the event for potential donors, Trump said many of the attendees had been \"really, really generous\" and said some had asked whether $25m was an appropriate donation.\n\n\"I said: I will take it,\" Trump remarked.\n\nThe White House has insisted there is nothing inappropriate in soliciting donations and that the ballroom will be used by future administrations. The renovation will not cost US taxpayers a cent, according to the administration.\n\nBut Mr Painter suggested it could be considered a \"pay-to-play scheme\", which has dogged previous White House administrations of both political parties.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, then-President Bill Clinton came under scrutiny for allegedly selling overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for campaign contributions.\n\nMore recently, Trump sought corporate sponsors for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll in April, which some said could amount to companies vying for the president's attention.\n\nTrump and administration officials have said that the new ballroom is a necessary renovation given the lack of large existing facilities to hold state dinners and other events. The White House often uses a tent on the South Lawn to fete foreign leaders and a larger guest list for a state dinner.\n\nBut the scale of the new ballroom, Mr Painter added, poses an \"enormous temptation\" to use the facility for political fundraising that was not the case before, even if presidents from both parties have invited supporters to events.\n\n\"The limited space [now] means that not everyone gets a White House invitation,\" he said. \"In my view, that's a good thing....the [current] size limits the 'pay to play' game, at least on White House premises.\"\n\nProving any wrongdoing, however, is unlikely.\n\n\"You can't prove a quid pro quo,\" Mr Painter said. \"But I think the Trump administration is pushing the envelope here.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly275d3dvdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:56:08.243+00:00","title":"Australia: Almond-sized crab and tiny lantern shark discovered in deep seas","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australian scientists from CSIRO and the Western Australian Museum discovered two new species in the deep sea off Western Australia during a 2022 research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park: a tiny, semi-transparent porcelain crab (1.5cm long) feeding with hairs and a glowing West Australian Lantern Shark (up to 40cm) found at depths over 600m.

breathed a sigh of relief when, three weeks ago, he bought the last big items - couches - for his newly-built home in Hopatcong, New Jersey.\n\nMr Cabrera, who started working with a contractor in March to construct the three-bedroom house, was eager to get ahead of a fresh round of tariffs on key building materials and home items that  took effect earlier this week .\n\nMr Cabrera had already seen his initial budget of roughly $300,000 balloon to $450,000 as prices for a range of products, like cabinets from Asia, started going up since the spring.\n\nEarlier this week  new US tariffs  came in on items needed to renovate your home including imported kitchen cabinets, timber and wooden furniture.\n\n\"Tariffs were definitely on my mind throughout the whole process,\" said Mr Cabrera, who succeeded in finishing his build before the new tariffs, but still noticed rising prices in the run up.\n\n\"It was a concern every morning looking at prices, trying to figure out how to control the budget that kept increasing,\" he said.\n\nMr Cabrera's experience is one many home buyers, builders and renovators are grappling with.\n\nWhile the White House says the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing and protect national security, economists say they could intensify the US housing market's woes by adding to President Donald Trump's previous tariffs and slowing construction.\n\n\"We're in a fairly weak position in the housing market to begin with,\" said Peter Harrell, a visiting scholar at Georgetown Law School. \"The last thing an already not great new construction market needs is higher input costs.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is adding onto an industry that has already seen its share of tariff increases.\"\n\nOther levies Trump has imposed this year have included a 50% tariff on steel and a 50% tariff on copper imports, which have raised costs for building materials such as copper piping.\n\nThe levies are the latest in a slew of measures that economists warn could keep pushing up prices for people across the US.\n\nA recent report from Goldman Sachs found that US consumers will shoulder as much as 55% of the cost of Trump's tariffs this year. It takes time to raise prices on consumers, the economists noted, and US firms will increasingly pass on costs in the coming months.\n\nEven before the new tariffs took effect this week, furniture companies had been warning about a hit from tariffs. In April, the chief executive of RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, reacted with an expletive as he watched his company's stock tumble, in response to a major tariff announcement from the White House.\n\nRH in September said it will face $30 million in new tariffs costs in the second half of this year. The company also delayed the release of a design catalogue, citing uncertainty about pricing due to tariffs.\n\nAnd executives at the furniture retailer IKEA, which is known for being budget-friendly, warned this week that tariffs might force the company to raise prices. It imports most of the products it sells in the US.\n\nJean Lin, the founder of a design gallery for furniture and home decor, said she is less exposed to tariffs than some other businesses in her industry. Most of the furniture she sells, in partnership with independent designers, is made in the US.\n\nBut her Manhattan-based cooperative, called Colony, has still been feeling a pinch from tariffs since this spring. Homeowners and interior designers have scaled back purchases and projects because of tariff-related uncertainty, which has taken a toll on her sales.\n\n\"It's really hard to invest in anything when there's unknowns, especially works of great value or works that are going to go in your home for a long time,\" Ms Lin said.\n\nMaterial costs had also been rising, even before the latest round of tariffs. Ms Lin said one US-based mill worker, with whom she is collaborating for an interior design project, imports his materials - and those keep getting more expensive.\n\nThat could mean higher prices for consumers down the line.\n\n\"The next project he does, whether it's ours or somebody else's, he's going to quote accordingly,\" she said. \"If the construction fees are going up, if the material costs are going up, your architect and your interior designer fees are going to go up as well.\"\n\nAt Stillfried Design in lower Manhattan, prices for furniture made in Germany and Austria rose by nearly 15% this summer to account for broad-based tariffs on European imports and tariffs on steel.\n\nMichael Trubrig, who co-owns the business with his wife, said: \"We had to raise prices because we couldn't lower the margin\". He does not expect the new furniture tariffs to affect him, because of a trade agreement capping tariffs on the European Union at 15%.\n\nBut the broader tariff landscape continues to present a hurdle.\n\n\"It's not business-ending, but it's not healthy, either,\" Mr Trubrig said.\n\nHigh mortgage rates have weighed on new home sales in recent years.\n\nThe new tariffs on imported timber, lumber, kitchen cabinets and furniture \"will create additional headwinds for an already challenged housing market by further raising construction and renovation costs,\" Buddy Hughes, chairman for the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.\n\nAffordable housing construction could be hit particularly hard, said Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. She said that as material costs rise, the cost of new housing development will increase, too, which could in turn prompt developers to rethink low-margin affordable housing projects.\n\nMatthew Walsh, a housing economist at Moody's Analytics, said that cost uncertainty will be the most immediate effect of this week's home building tariffs, especially since the levies are poised to ramp up again in January.\n\nSome economists say the furniture and lumber tariffs, on their own, are unlikely to spell disaster for builders and single-handedly tank the home building market.\n\n\"It's not a catastrophe for home builders ,\" said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com. \"It's yet another unwelcome thing that they have to deal with now.\"\n\nBut, he noted, \"these things do add up.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/nobel-prize-2025-what-they-are-when-will-the-awards-be-announced","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"09:07:20+00:00","title":"What are Nobel Prizes, when are the awards announced?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Nobel Prizes have officially begun with the announcement of the medicine prize to Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance, a breakthrough that has enabled new treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykzv3y9pko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"14:14:50.668+00:00","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs says he plans to appeal sentence and conviction","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, a globally recognized music mogul, has been convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution and sentenced to 50 months in prison, a $500,000 fine, and five years of probation.

how Prince Andrew can afford his sprawling 30-room Windsor mansion, in a lease agreement which has been revealed.\n\nThe arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a document seen by BBC News confirms.\n\nThe deal meant that  instead of paying annual rent , Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments up-front, including for renovations.\n\nIn effect, those payments - which totalled around £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.\n\nDetails about Prince Andrew's living arrangements have been scrutinised as controversy continues over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a scandal which has been reignited by  new sexual abuse allegations contained in Virginia Giuffre's posthumously-published memoir .\n\nWhile Prince Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Giuffre, fresh questions have been asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.\n\nPrince Andrew, who gave up titles including the Duke of York last week, signed the lease agreement on his home in 2003 with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.\n\nThe Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.\n\nPrince Andrew's rent is described as a \"peppercorn\", which means a small sum such as £1, which can be paid every year on a long lease, as part of a legal arrangement between a tenant and the landlord. Or in his case there was no payment at all.\n\nIt's not about making a profit but is a symbolic payment, in this case from Prince Andrew to the Crown Estate.\n\nThis ongoing arrangement poses a problem for the Royal Family: with Prince Andrew mired in scandal, it is a terrible look to have him living among them in Windsor in apparent splendour.\n\nThe lease document also show Prince Andrew has to keep paying for the upkeep of Royal Lodge, ensuring the exterior stonework is in good condition every five years and painting the interior every seven years.\n\nHe has to \"paint, paper, polish, decorate\" to keep the house in good condition and to keep the landscaped grounds and gardens in good order. Prince Andrew, as the tenant, also has to allow his landlords to inspect and make sure he is keeping to the terms of the lease.\n\nOther details revealed in the lease include clauses specifying that no helicopters are able to land there, and no gambling is allowed on the premises.\n\nInformation separately published by the National Audit Office shows Prince Andrew had to pay for £5 million worth of repairs, £2.5 million for the option of buying out future rent and a further £1 million premium to the Crown Estate.\n\nThere might now be questions about where Andrew got the funds in 2003 to effectively pay more than £8 million for a lease for life.\n\nThat up-front payment arrangement helps to explain how he can currently afford to live there, given he does not have to make a monthly payment.\n\nThe deal was based on a notional rent of £260,000 per year, although with the recognition that it would have been hard to rent out the property commercially because of the security restrictions.\n\nAnd the NAO said the refurbishments went on to cost Andrew more than £7.5m, rather than the initial £5m anticipated by the deal.\n\nThere were other precedents for this kind of arrangement with the Crown Estate. In 1998, Prince Edward took a 50-year lease for Bagshot Park, putting in about £580,000 to pay for renovations which later rose to about £1.4m.\n\nIt was a smaller up-front payment than Prince Andrew paid, with Edward then having to pay rent of about £90,000 per year, which will have risen since in line with inflation.\n\nIt's been no secret that Buckingham Palace has wanted to see him move out of such a grand setting, but it's also recognised that he has a cast-iron lease, independently held, on Royal Lodge.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, when Prince Andrew was a less controversial figure, the deal on Royal Lodge was seen as financially better for the taxpayer than using the house as a \"grace and favour\" residence, where someone might live without any commercial payment.\n\nThe property at the time, once occupied by the Queen Mother, had been rundown and in need of modernisation, and getting Prince Andrew to pay for the building work was seen as a way of avoiding any public expense.\n\nAnd because of security requirements about the house's location on the Windsor estate, the Crown Estate was keener to keep a cash-paying royal there, when it could have been difficult to put on the open market.\n\nAn NAO report said the arrangement met the Crown Estate's obligation to provide \"value for money\" and that it had been \"money's worth\".\n\nThe King last year ended any financial support for his brother - and it still remains unclear how Andrew pays for costs such as security and the requirement to pay for the upkeep.\n\nThe arrangement by which he paid cash up-front rather than monthly rent, and his agreement to carry out substantial repairs, also explains why he will be reluctant to give up his place in Royal Lodge, which he shares with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.\n\nPart of the deal was that if he left early in the lease he could reclaim some of the money that he had paid up-front, with that amount tapering down over time, until that guarantee ended entirely after 25 years. The longer he stayed there, the less he would get back if he gave up the lease.\n\nIt's now more than 22 years since he signed the lease and so the amount he would get back has kept falling. At the current rate, it's about £186,000 for each remaining year until 2028.\n\nThe lease is due to end in June 2078, beyond his expected lifetime, and the arrangement also includes the clause that his ex-wife and daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie could continue with it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Number 10 said it was up to the NAO whether to re-examine Prince Andrew's lease arrangements for the building.\n\nDame Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons treasury committee, said \"we need to have answers\" to ensure taxpayers' money was not being misspent.\n\nAsked about Prince Andrew's living arrangements, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"I haven't seen the details of this... but I do think people should pay their way and pay their fair share.\"\n\nShadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick had earlier said: \"It's about time Prince Andrew took himself off to live in private and make his own way in life.\"\n\nWhile Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokeswoman Lisa Smart said Andrew \"should show some contrition by returning every penny of rent that he's not paid while disgracing his office\".\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

media trial\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been ordered to testify in a landmark trial in the US over the impact of social media on young people.\n\nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl this week rejected the argument his company, Meta Platforms, had made that an in-person appearance was not necessary.\n\nHer order also applies to Snap boss Evan Spiegel, as well as Adam Mosseri, who leads Meta-owned Instagram.\n\nThe trial, expected in January, is among the first to advance from a wave of litigation accusing social media companies of making their apps addictive and enticing to young people despite being aware of mental health and other risks.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLaw firm Kirkland & Ellis, which is representing Snap, said the decision did not \"bear at all\" on the truth of the claims and that they \"look forward to the opportunity\" of why they believe the \"allegations against Snapchat are wrong factually and as a matter of law\".\n\nHundreds of claims brought by parents and school districts were consolidated into one case before the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2022.\n\nThey accuse the companies of having ineffective parental controls and weak safety features, and also say that alerts for \"likes\" and other responses keep young people tied to the platforms.\n\nMeta and Snap have contested the claims, which are similar to those in a separate, but similarly sprawling federal case. TikTok and YouTube, owned by Alphabet, are also named in the suits.\n\nIn seeking to have both cases dismissed, the tech companies have argued that federal law protected them from responsibility for content on their platforms. Under a law passed in the 1990s, they are not liable for what people say or post on their services.\n\nBut the Los Angeles judge said the companies must still face claims of negligence and personal injury stemming from the apps' designs.\n\nLawyers representing young people and their parents argue that the companies decided not to make changes because they were concerned about the hit to the business.\n\nMeta had said Zuckerberg and Mosseri had already submitted to questioning as part of the case and that appearing in person represented \"a substantial burden\" and would \"interfere with business\".\n\nBut Judge Kuhn wrote that hearing directly from the heads of the company was key to evaluating those claims.\n\n\"The testimony of a CEO is uniquely relevant,\" Judge Kushn said, as their \"knowledge of harms, and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms\" could help prove negligence.\n\nBeasley Allen, one of the firms law firms leading the litigation against the social media companies, was pleased with the ruling.\n\n\"We are eager for trial to force these companies and their executives to answer for the harms they've caused to countless children,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSocial media companies have been facing growing legal and political pressure arising from concerns about the impact of the apps on young people's mental health.\n\nTestifying before Congress on the issues last year, Zuckerberg said his company took the issues seriously and defended the protections it had in place, while distancing it from responsibility.\n\n\"The existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health,\" he said.\n\nInstagram last year started rolling out special \"teen accounts\" in response to concerns.\n\nIt updated that system earlier this month, adding a  default setting that screens out content guided by a system similar to movie ratings. It also said parents could opt for stricter controls.\n\nReporting contributed by Lily Jamali"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp9lqzkpzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"14:58:08.287+00:00","title":"Warner Bros Discovery explores sale citing interest from buyers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warner Bros Discovery, the media conglomerate owning HBO, CNN, and other networks, is exploring a potential sale amid unsolicited offers from buyers, including Paramount Skydance.

earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.\n\nOne Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.\n\nIt's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.\n\nHow long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.\n\nThe boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.\n\nWashington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.\n\nIsraeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.\n\nWhen Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".\n\nInstead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.\n\nNetanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.\n\nBut Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.\n\nThe yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.\n\nThe dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.\n\nBut Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.\n\nAgreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.\n\nFrom here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\n\n\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"\n\nDonald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ej7ly369o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:20:41.679+00:00","title":"Pardoned Capitol rioter arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Hakeem Jeffries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Christopher Moynihan, a man pardoned by former President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been arrested in New York for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries during a speech.

Capitol riot has been charged with threatening to kill the top Democrat in the House of Representatives.\n\nChristopher Moynihan, 34, was arrested in the town of Clinton, New York, for making a terroristic threat to kill a member of Congress, New York State Police said. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMoynihan allegedly planned to target House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries during a speech to the Economic Club of New York scheduled for this week, according to court filings obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\n\"I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" Moynihan allegedly wrote in text messages.\n\nAccording to court filings, Moynihan also wrote: \"Even if I am hated, [Jeffries] must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future.\"\n\nJeffries, a lead contender to become Speaker should Democrats take control of the House, said he was grateful to police and federal agents for apprehending \"a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out\".\n\n\"Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned,\" he added.\n\nMoynihan was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2023 for breaching the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as part of the mob seeking to stop Congress from certifying that Joe Biden had won the 2020 election and to keep Trump in power.\n\nProsecutors said he was one of the first rioters to break through police barricades.\n\nAfter he entered the Senate chamber, they said, he flipped through a notebook on a desk and took pictures with his phone, saying there had to be information in them they could \"use against\" lawmakers.\n\nOn Trump's first day back in office, he pardoned Moynihan and more than 1,000 other riot defendants, calling them \"hostages\" whose lives had been \"detroyed\". Several other pardoned rioters have also since been arrested for a variety of charges.\n\nLast month, he posted a doctored video of Jeffries wearing a sombrero when talks on avoiding a government shutdown failed and accused him of favoring people in the country illegally over US citizens.\n\nPolitical violence has turned deadly in the US this year. A man in June allegedly  targeted Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota , killing one and her husband and wounding another. Then, in September, a Utah man allegedly shot and killed  conservative activist Charlie Kirk .\n\nMoynihan is being held in a facility in Poughkeepsie and is next scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. He has been read his charges and pleaded not guilty, according to the local prosecutor."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxknd9l474o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:20:28.396+00:00","title":"Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk's board shaken up as directors quit","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is experiencing a major boardroom shake-up, with seven members — including chairman Helge Lund and vice chair Henrik Poulsen — stepping down in November.

Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been.\"\n\n\"With unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning - it is an innocent man,\" he wrote. \"Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side... but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge.\"\n\nMoments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: \"He'll be inside for at least three weeks or a month.\"\n\nSarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Santé prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.\n\nSarkozy's cell in the prison's isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in the another wing for \"vulnerable people\", where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.\n\nHe will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly €14 (£12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.\n\nThe former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact.\n\nBut he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.\n\n\"Conditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard,\" La Santé ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. \"You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and there's a type of social isolation which makes life difficult\".\n\nAt the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the Élysée Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday \"it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context\".\n\nMacron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role \"to comment on or criticise judicial decisions\", but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of \"a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment\".\n\nIn a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozy's safety and the proper functioning of the jail.\n\n\"I cannot be insensitive to a man's distress,\" he added.\n\nEver since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.\n\nLate next month, France's highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozy's appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.\n\nAhead of his arrival at La Santé prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: \"I'm not afraid of prison. I'll keep my head held high, including at the prison gates.\"\n\nSarkozy has always denied doing anything wrong in a case involving allegations that his 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of euros in Libyan cash.\n\nThe former centre-right leader was cleared of personally receiving the money but convicted of criminal association with two close aides, Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, for their role in secret campaign financing from the Libyans.\n\nThe two men both had talks with Gaddafi's intelligence chief and brother-in-law in 2005, a meeting arranged by a Franco-Lebanese intermediary called Ziad Tiakeddine, who died in Lebanon shortly before Sarkozy's conviction.\n\nAs he lodged an appeal, Sarkozy is still considered innocent but he has been told he must go to jail in view of the \"exceptional seriousness of the facts\".\n\nSarkozy said he would take two books with him into prison, a life of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils and the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas's classic story of a man wrongly imprisoned who escapes to wreak vengeance on his prosecutors."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l7z53pe4go","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:26:47.271+00:00","title":"South Korea: Woman trying to kill cockroach sets apartment block on fire","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A woman in her 20s in Osan, South Korea, attempted to kill a cockroach using an improvised flamethrower made from a lighter and flammable spray, which ignited a fire in her apartment building.

And kept on going.\n\nEileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a Nasa spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name.\n\nNow a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that.\n\nWe meet Collins at London's Science Museum. She's softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel.\n\n\"I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do,\" she says.\n\n\"Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I'll be a lady astronaut.\"\n\nBut that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft.\n\nAnd the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot.\n\nIn the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa's reusable \"space planes\".\n\nShe knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995.\n\n\"As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,\" she says.\n\n\"And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: 'Hey, they're really good'.\"\n\nShe was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another first.\n\nCollins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both.\n\nBut Collins says being a mum and a commander were \"the two best jobs in the world\".\n\n\"But I'm going to tell you it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander,\" she laughs.\n\n\"The best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent - because you have to learn how to say no to people.\"\n\nNasa's Space Shuttles, which flew for three decades, reached breathtaking highs, but also some terrible lows.\n\nIn 1986, the Challenger spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure seconds after launching, killing all seven crew members on board.\n\nAnd in 2003, the Columbia shuttle broke up in the skies over Texas at the end of its mission, killing its crew of seven as well.\n\nA piece of insulating foam on Columbia's fuel tank broke loose during launch, damaging the heat shield with devastating results.\n\nColumbia was unable to withstand the fiery re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating as the world watched on in horror.\n\nCollins shakes her head at the memory of the disaster, and of the friends whose lives were lost.\n\nBut with her job as commander, she had to pick up the mantle - she was to be in charge of the shuttle's following flight.\n\nDid she think about quitting at that point?\n\n\"People throughout the shuttle programme were counting on the commander to stick with it,\" she says quietly.\n\n\"I think quitting the mission would have been the opposite of brave… and I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people.\"\n\nBut when her mission finally took to the skies in 2005, the nightmare scenario happened again. A chunk of foam broke away during launch.\n\nThis time, though, there was a plan in place to check the damage. But it meant undertaking one of the riskiest maneuvers in space history.\n\nCollins had to pilot the shuttle through a 360 degree flip while flying beneath the International Space Station. It allowed colleagues on the orbiting lab to photograph the craft's underside and check if the heatshield had been breached.\n\n\"There were engineers and managers saying it couldn't be done, all these reasons why it was too dangerous,\" she says.\n\n\"I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander, and I said: 'It sounds like we can do it'.\"\n\nWith her hands steady at the controls, her voice calm as she spoke to mission control, Collins piloted the craft through a slow, graceful somersault. With the shuttle's underside now visible, the damage was quickly spotted - and a spacewalk was carried out to repair it.\n\nIt meant Collins and her crew would make it safely home.\n\nThis was Collins's last flight. She tells us that she always planned to stop after her fourth mission - to give others a chance to go to space.\n\nAnd she's watched plenty of astronauts follow in her footsteps. Does she have any advice for the next generation dreaming of the stars?\n\n\"Do your homework, listen to your teacher, pay attention in class and read books, and that will give you something to focus on,\" she says in a matter-of-fact way.\n\nThose who follow Collins to space will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander.\n\nShe says she has no regrets about bringing her astronaut career to an end. She made her decision and didn't look back. But there's still a wistful look in her eye when we ask if she'd be tempted if a seat on a spacecraft became free.\n\n\"Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday. When I'm an old lady, maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space.\"\n\nSpacewoman is in selected cinemas now."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15pz8vpjp9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"14:18:56.794+00:00","title":"Daniel Naroditsky, US chess grandmaster, dies aged 29","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Daniel Naroditsky, a US chess grandmaster and influential online educator, died at the age of 29.

girls in Japan today, the image of Sanae Takaichi taking the helm of power as the country's first ever female leader is powerful and formative.\n\nIt means a patriarchal society and a political system that has long been dominated by men is now led by a woman.\n\nBut while the optics speak of a progressive moment, some women don't see her as an advocate for change.\n\n\"It was quite interesting to see how people outside Japan have reacted to the news.\" Ayda Ogura, 21, says.\n\n\"Everyone's like, 'wow, she's the first female prime minister in Japanese history and that would be a great opportunity for women empowerment and gender equality in Japan'.\n\n\"I think that's a very naive interpretation.\"\n\nInstead, Ms Ogura points to her \"political beliefs and what she stands for\", adding: \"She perpetuates the patriarchal system.\"\n\nA big fan of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has always wanted to be the \"Iron Lady\" of her country.\n\nAnd like Thatcher, Takaichi is a staunch conservative.\n\nObservers say her leadership is a tactical move from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to appeal to the more conservative base which had recently gravitated towards Japan's parties further to the right.\n\nTakaichi opposes same-sex marriage and has long stood against legislation that would allow married couples to have separate surnames, preventing many women from keeping their maiden names.\n\nShe's also against women being in line for succession in the imperial family.\n\nHowever, she did soften some of her messaging during her campaign - saying she favours giving tax incentives to companies that provide childcare facilities to their employees and spoke of possible tax breaks for families spending on childcare.\n\nBut she has over the years backed the idea of a more traditional role for women in society and in the family.\n\nWhen it comes to women's issues, Takaichi is consistent with her country's less than impressive record on gender issues.\n\nJapanese women are among the best educated and highest qualified in the world and yet they struggle with the expectations of a conservative society that still pushes them in traditional roles.\n\nAccording to the 2025 gender gap index by the World Economic Forum, Japan ranked 118th among 148 countries, with female representation in the field of politics notably low.\n\nLeadership positions have traditionally been dominated by men and Japan has struggled to increase the number of female lawmakers and business leaders.\n\nThe world's fourth largest economy ranks last among the G7 countries when it comes to the share of women in its national parliament.  Specifically, women make up about 15.7% of lawmakers in Japan, the lowest figure among the G7.\n\nIt is even slow when it comes to women's reproductive health: only this week was it announced that the \"morning after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception available without prescription in more than 90 countries - had finally been approved for  over the counter use in Japan .\n\nEven so, some see Takaichi's rise to power as a pivotal moment that could change how women view their prospects.\n\n\"There is great significance in Ms Takaichi becoming prime minister, with a broader impact on society,\" Naomi Koshi - who became the country's youngest female mayor in 2012 - told Japan's Kyodo news agency.\n\nKoshi argued Japan having a female prime minister will \"lower psychological barriers\" for women and girls, helping them feel it is normal to \"stand out\" as leaders in companies and society, even as gender-based stereotypes and expectations still remain.\n\nBut Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, points out that, while it is remarkable Japan has its first female leader, one must remember it took her more than 30 years to get to that position.\n\n\"She's also not really going against the grain. She's saying the same thing as the men.\"\n\nMs Hill-Uekawa adds that she shouldn't be put on a pedestal simply because she is a woman.\n\n\"We need to make sure we're talking about her policies. We need to be able to criticise her equally as everyone else.\"\n\nIt is not just what Takaichi has said which has led people to label her as a defender of the patriarchy.\n\nIt's also evident by who her champions inside the party have been.\n\nShe's the protégé of the late former hawkish prime minister Shinzo Abe, and was backed in the leadership election by Taro Aso - a senior figure in the LDP at the head of one of the ruling party's most influential conservative blocs.\n\nHis faction's support for Sanae Takaichi was pivotal in uniting the party's right wing behind her.\n\n\"I do feel that it is difficult for women to sort of relate to her success because it furthers this idea that we must be compliant with the status quo,\" 21-year-old Minori Konishi says.\n\nMs Ogura agrees, saying that with her as a figurehead for women in politics, \"people are going to expect the same from us as well\".\n\n\"They're going to expect us to be compliant, not go against the ideals that they have, and it might make our job more difficult.\"\n\nMaking history, however, was just the first of the challenges Takaichi will face - not least tackling a sluggish economy and inflation and winning back the trust of a frustrated and angry electorate, as well as hosting president Trump within days of taking power.\n\nIt's safe to say that no-one expects gender equality issues to be high on her priority list."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9722wlmj7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:52:08.997+00:00","title":"Louvre heist: Stolen jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A daring daylight heist at the Louvre in Paris saw four masked thieves steal high-value jewellery, including a Napoleon-era necklace and Empress Eugenie’s tiara, valued at €88 million.

The Oval Office has been  goldened with some signature \"Trump touches\". And now bulldozers are tearing away the facade of White House's East Wing - making way for a brand-new ballroom.\n\nBut this is not the first time the White House has been renovated - the building has been a constant work-in-progress.\n\nWhether it's FDR's indoor pool, Truman's bowling alley, or Obama's basketball court, the upgrades have left a mark of their own.\n\nHere are some of the biggest remodelling projects the White House has seen.\n\nIn 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt called on architect Charles McKim to help with a major renovation of the White House.\n\nThe most noticeable change was replacing the Victorian-era conservatories - glasshouses for growing plants - with the West Wing, where presidents and other officials now have offices.\n\nBut the construction project was not beloved by all.\n\nSome lawmakers in Congress were upset about the $65,000 (£48,000) bill, which would amount to more than $2m in 2025. Others were upset over the destruction of the traditional conservatories, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nThe White House once had an indoor swimming pool.\n\nIt was created in 1933 for President Franklin D Roosevelt, who suffered from polio and swam at therapy pools.\n\nThe pool has since been covered but is underneath the floor of the press centre, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nOne of the most massive restructurings of the White House came nearly 150 years after the building was first built.\n\nWhen President Harry Truman first moved into the White House in 1945, it was in desperate need of repairs after years of neglect. In 1946, Congress authorised $780,000 for the remodel.\n\nTruman oversaw the construction from 1948 to 1952, which gutted most of the  building while leaving in place the exterior White House walls.\n\nThe project also included the addition of a bowling alley and a balcony.\n\nDuring President John F Kennedy's administration, his wife, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, launched her own project to restore the interior of the White House.\n\nShe hired renowned collector Henry Francis Du Pont, who had transformed his home into the first Museum of American Decorative Arts in 1951.\n\nPhilanthropists donated antiques, fine paintings and other upgrades for the building.\n\nAfter the $2m restoration, Kennedy offered a televised tour of the White House - the first of its kind from a first lady - that was broadcast on Valentine's Day in 1962.\n\nThe first lady also had the Resolute Desk, a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B Hayes in 1880, restored in 1963.\n\nShortly after taking office, President Barack Obama, a basketball fan, transformed a tennis court so it could be used for both tennis and basketball.\n\nHe also added a rug that featured the Martin Luther King Jr quote: \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''"}]}
